0.0	0.298404068554	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.330197134291	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.5	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.356924733693	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.548655148666	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.241448793933	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.370648237368	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.676843355148	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.408920291837	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.178350310825	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.337095294878	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.

0.0	0.274858316468	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.388336444707	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.193192379879	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.555531774133	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.449835273165	I'm tested.
0.0	0.4859837734	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.619023565061	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
1.0	0.446600592586	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.319633428719	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.534865198892	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.267744845323	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.370129214216	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.630920033684	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.388804901198	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.510918650264	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.250461331046	I like that.
0.0	0.239611637815	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.446895843729	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.49308275659	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.458348915039	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.415454583943	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.699801972422	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.49364569493	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.732026348274	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.594757887383	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.614300882127	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.318140980228	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.362294885644	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.626397524774	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.141741321737	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.0473406253945	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.200390410978	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.410992959734	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.589351969806	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.363400281609	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.290784563682	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.317746594633	in particular.
0.0	0.133830790872	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.437377959173	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.51365925837	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.638928601324	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.671888628924	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.529410057202	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.254995102034	Neil...
0.0	0.5666517133	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.538425631902	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.310160514347	...income tax...
0.0	0.698581972454	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.176972293352	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.528784221425	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.644877813539	I've got five grandkids.

0.0	0.277249192822	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.699259308972	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.237142537663	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.596784049136	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.559442341179	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.371158402777	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.514043353669	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.298102264601	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.215327835785	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.219957576978	...
0.0	0.572454081043	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.455527028364	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.0675441065492	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.412276027318	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.172659569059	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.2398456481	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.482063665666	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.421910227243	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.329296493484	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.

0.0	0.40308114463	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.296147141271	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.529770568921	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.361812222779	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.679925867032	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.574988690455	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.64789582221	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.59679129301	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.670961296362	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.140464156683	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.516609631268	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.259326359802	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.526151583601	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.422545842226	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.545792670704	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.328889270242	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.592356951821	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.544871887462	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.5	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.331484321652	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.965508212764	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.263963559306	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.463403011998	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.682451870456	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
1.0	0.740599615233	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.36352911222	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.556587660905	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.207115638002	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.56457970606	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.39146736539	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.477342550343	We need a doer, not a talker.
1.0	0.315131809198	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.277798483306	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.295849097311	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.354830276109	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.322467315446	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.720087523237	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.149107991843	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.0318927975259	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.406158376738	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.671745244083	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.426197747331	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.296723862652	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.207305288836	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.342125363175	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
1.0	0.824965782201	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.514768211146	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.654598125218	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.41232976162	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.418652999536	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.230866347932	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.429238367416	I suspect you may have.
1.0	0.842180873185	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.833886544473	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.352432061859	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.445807999196	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.517357714208	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.416254348885	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
1.0	0.245522861529	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.212238244757	This country is changing.
0.0	0.443357176303	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.318574655824	No.
0.0	0.871973132771	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.148634409612	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.219960961046	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.283763312127	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.346292523364	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.250985502144	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.288228057139	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.384251252506	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.455282077172	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.172227588505	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.493855014255	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.403643137096	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.305119036743	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.727854140498	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.0783176612333	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.245184947434	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.306427923576	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.489723139165	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.27755242469	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.209458156408	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.471230623499	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.238265746091	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.512315453237	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.11867759269	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.339838835424	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.405465080089	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.364123059063	On welfare.
0.0	0.463687212463	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.341320893487	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.372272075413	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.466335872021	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.394763885534	That's not right.
0.0	0.243829087954	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.70065876672	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.315837584703	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.392132300985	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.381519328542	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.894314725167	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.423906812169	A brief response.
0.0	0.449591824978	And Lehman Brothers started it all.

0.0	0.422147113782	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.485583464517	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.338561739651	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.356806210912	They're very, very badly wounded.

0.0	0.226436695801	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.45408638523	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
1.0	0.907638777057	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.327846169884	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.412772115216	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.393421759936	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.213997096387	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.410673846874	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.383967843839	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.0604826709012	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.68078532423	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.38975965972	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.718771935765	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.19654885381	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
1.0	0.451513127717	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.614630950352	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.410067687271	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.

0.0	0.427994489447	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.309107872174	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.355952645687	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.203258937232	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.419920340581	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.511563496499	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.644505504729	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.372405766896	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.322690421372	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.749323732057	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.484264668291	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.385727800159	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.201491003111	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.37484158938	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.482638527609	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
1.0	0.392076740309	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.645377635116	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.178520156807	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.310923282558	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.1242850805	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.5	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.538076203827	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.315281695873	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.476657847364	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.0592131221907	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.395034014451	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.622034068123	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.446044748	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.151895926369	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.0666220424799	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.147645390259	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.547631194674	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.33611422538	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.387094548526	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.1443409502	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.464439621142	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.397004608588	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.391293143164	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.427144825578	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.198132437225	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.420183067765	That is important.
0.0	0.185333175269	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.57198528137	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.794773591717	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.38987143011	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.391959337777	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.466521102328	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.0643569544097	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.556448839458	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.663329981341	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.186580599661	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.697898411999	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.633691465125	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.183957479304	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.42705756352	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.162736993518	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.467777201996	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.280473523557	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.617412660348	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.490578911828	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.278653191556	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.476280517497	I know every one.
0.0	0.453887416662	I changed that.
0.0	0.476543510094	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.398406037579	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.12291778868	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.395770649352	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.105935701552	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.0996712375743	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.22374100505	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.609956368986	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.201020397929	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.29766912315	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.417072996801	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.

0.0	0.455164752252	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.208013862753	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.366187365021	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.399015460266	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
1.0	0.335325842052	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.531134455979	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.

0.0	0.581442944515	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.328466198739	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.633864234139	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.464209030252	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.59232646719	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.622167704965	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.768017130289	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?

0.0	0.294516427197	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.259706292508	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.209710756728	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.

0.0	0.707035708829	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.5851601287	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.380020913205	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.265929339962	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.729039314419	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.263869672216	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.668679590183	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.606937982673	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.149188330888	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.545811217814	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.508974241992	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.124089959546	...No, sir...

0.0	0.0786114729677	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.23211404873	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.0228143510849	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.118310385594	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.309338750756	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.44407398309	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.353384101767	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.562312799503	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.353940163801	I support NAFTA.

0.0	0.953845573664	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.348990608902	OK?
0.0	0.491703632694	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.

0.0	0.239534261379	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.335330307065	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.448119074943	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.677814217175	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.

0.0	0.793597324656	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.798277400714	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.338253195116	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.

0.0	0.190876215447	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.0731414272253	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.442118381234	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.55217620531	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.674066061916	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.241342679172	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
1.0	0.549813472055	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.200147990772	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.384254429481	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.407850682326	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.489285350524	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.37694094801	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.313062951077	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.400887308547	I promise.
0.0	0.38100184183	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.405043725291	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.369428872496	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.179020738697	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.399017788571	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.338059312932	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.539065144038	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.360941040375	John?
0.0	0.262668272888	Well, sure.
0.0	0.348884867232	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.192064830804	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.229165100012	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.44465416276	They're a scam.
0.0	0.181025901755	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.521934786009	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.881205709297	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.409114067271	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.168201389628	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.335516488792	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
1.0	0.659291569833	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.593617408403	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.230500667321	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.545972268343	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.296262314462	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.488353448287	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.385063846238	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.455732836136	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.367413351119	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.1614306187	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.0901740850995	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.419444903344	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.53755347172	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.39203015214	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.284777677614	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.267901808847	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.46350829413	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.560254489013	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.327832693111	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.359272311179	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.294326545288	Why is that?
0.0	0.19440944567	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.172117308615	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.412190244812	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.361911556155	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.316571914136	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.701581090334	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.208466886061	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.644732506703	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.568829187158	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.361708864242	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.258131410106	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.110176727671	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.348990608902	Yes.
0.0	0.664253022526	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.283624643234	I understand.
0.0	0.727027334884	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.383327723622	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.176070036761	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.380723883839	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
1.0	0.659400670857	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.619845758879	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.279460825863	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.488101454957	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.149194115574	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.34735244854	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.483223644454	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.392821361794	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.131267637587	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.597057588715	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.515986852215	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.411800209943	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.54743754943	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.477546155416	You do legislation.
0.0	0.199647458593	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.369683016511	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.381099408773	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.453838888971	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.261823171033	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.162629551601	And here's why.
0.0	0.0243366765641	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.450885697256	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.291529474592	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.318574655824	No.
0.0	0.366397709092	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.429566607731	My background is different.
0.0	0.343033200057	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.14847039085	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.447750903213	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.297084548364	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.574323307714	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.446738519152	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.337462241919	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.385152431957	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.407780071423	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.212715678573	...Chris...
0.0	0.513788511034	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.370045994576	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.5	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.739781257071	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.203417842187	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.46435529586	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.319158762405	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.651270107028	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.657365447904	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.384217821244	My point is this.
0.0	0.388003974822	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.661819155392	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.24529118421	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.440127067201	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.364157541056	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.467193241219	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.422460499055	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.258750635946	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.0972637915093	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.338859419881	I can't do it.
0.0	0.601294758272	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.36094451502	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.274832914962	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.731229129655	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.5	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.569241172934	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.234779909859	I am against the raids.
1.0	0.556042710576	Very few children.
0.0	0.616405689683	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.485741371939	That's what I said.
0.0	0.336366389999	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.544551357472	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.276878104325	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
1.0	0.54922414748	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.457537823222	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.344240785033	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.352648421309	And you know what?
0.0	0.318972670334	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.211867977449	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.429493984564	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.490840349498	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.263150298038	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.52660140812	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.620450710029	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.312879725299	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.136129631759	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.307135364713	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
1.0	0.911879529735	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.38105969673	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.418187493547	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.193700085103	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.493667910355	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.393155646822	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.376644121452	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.470575429449	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.433773828365	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.400440624321	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.38587239015	Good at email.
0.0	0.68011891643	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.737180672391	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.307199871099	I can do that.
0.0	0.299334488196	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.449935722799	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.461276052948	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.490331949341	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.1206522135	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.48465945272	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.276709034377	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.295400352371	And, we said no.
0.0	0.480938906568	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.306569953344	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.295648983993	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.56328875849	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.639613688046	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.136653952401	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.291550738523	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.621274845825	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.417130619829	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.439980624759	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.377169319679	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.200035412236	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.528076935226	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.315699584964	See?
0.0	0.619269221464	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.225312022882	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.352648421309	And you know what?
0.0	0.418518878825	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.348311570337	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.67201376121	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.34782380371	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.286711482062	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.482910676705	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.390819170448	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.591745102185	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.375130061587	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.507708624011	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.547067142784	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.804763865095	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.634059916465	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.415550574458	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.409698054565	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.516687593173	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.567075081238	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.469810394756	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.5	He is a good man.
0.0	0.241447154449	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.429609787684	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.290326441029	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.344281831398	That will change everything.
0.0	0.490736376011	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.335802814091	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.367436999461	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.178105750302	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.0459864305882	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.685385563354	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.214357731318	It's a joke.
0.0	0.402909639874	That's an interesting question.
1.0	0.738728865926	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.312308203691	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.296389829779	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.453539653989	But I was born here.
0.0	0.648088302525	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.142697079083	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.134686716737	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.374380718763	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.322189326657	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.663818890559	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.235831984454	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
1.0	0.673727009366	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.209338602707	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.257297925095	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.337845049862	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.88681619658	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.345846836025	You can have him.
0.0	0.228210096943	And so do I.
0.0	0.267837189988	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.369164124454	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.650390324142	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.884513524211	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.218203241342	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.122288947349	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.521871057385	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.274613107781	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.417628539777	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.319739395564	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.330760113462	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.40162149428	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.412261075833	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.491612907114	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.667057430497	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.257039387378	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.338303378306	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.607111816452	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.483169910537	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.272340501264	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.403796964254	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.395316883858	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.44169475033	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.56001151335	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.433372755627	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.430035858375	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.27485480392	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.422069224241	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.27339116166	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.560634002843	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.560833353431	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.302626860522	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.237142993254	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.575846671105	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.254995102034	Becky --
0.0	0.431514165425	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.341107310209	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.444345714716	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.379962494192	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.42376641792	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.194779112889	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.453294825985	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.382048694772	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.549446614088	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.470617530758	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.646432464368	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.671643339144	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.346580129955	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.934795611731	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.517826198336	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.353651375013	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.162317231063	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.370164422135	You don't have to.
0.0	0.283746588901	I totally get that.
0.0	0.123486812019	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.629135894576	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.478580454184	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.530540328018	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.332844962182	That has not been...
0.0	0.477092635793	I never said that.
0.0	0.217783538671	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.446359602012	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.219575484162	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
1.0	0.695472829253	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.474907670729	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.341401089546	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.831681243761	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.507423910682	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.619975453814	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.705512097162	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.740053385982	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.546682213207	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.558846707321	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.571816264142	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.388975026581	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.436514938041	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.59707816508	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.806468182719	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.735024240014	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.525502184747	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.711367591346	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.434072286676	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.37077154202	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.309090713059	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.423934665162	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.059753057468	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.5	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.22953097088	I would just say that...
0.0	0.25774273239	That is...
0.0	0.61201901473	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
1.0	0.610600639073	They were wrong.
0.0	0.592973127335	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.29964849623	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.352993278362	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.398946791459	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.1035631776	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.284483468612	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.396102642573	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.220451920383	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.341668853433	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.5	It's their money.
0.0	0.297592200239	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.115623478029	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.348982224829	Right.
0.0	0.416556189615	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.393468785825	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.219430697288	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.709684650166	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.875661488385	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.343262540534	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.0540285860958	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.281297441128	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.545774103229	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.596515650134	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.19340804145	... he's really doing some bad...
1.0	0.284607539293	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.564071432944	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.555559753927	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.44484877881	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.286762097299	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.201292039966	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.74295458902	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.26866938336	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.494434674628	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.476184966431	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.610007878373	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.430398540943	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
1.0	0.486141889569	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.663593898159	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.572456822743	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.460404115984	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.517884329699	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.39646054775	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.391742106444	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.335949272586	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.352874521217	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.515242283021	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.540649836385	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.794023491783	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.303454040474	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.333154473721	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.354322155303	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.552973338313	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.385624669278	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.509066152196	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.334377241305	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.218589569329	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.34969808728	Not bad.
0.0	0.464213936111	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.389657722103	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.589053735419	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.690839580102	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.180112994128	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.689423673563	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.470324361918	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.0545414535721	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.216919790928	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.4940660149	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.527205730974	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.394858575277	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.293421118184	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.707586259247	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.0348982611345	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.543854596569	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.244702490561	Again...
0.0	0.525520536854	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.461528257494	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.302398423567	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.349000796955	(inaudible).
0.0	0.590135072162	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.449281340013	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.700676739689	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.0536984887631	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.614140441938	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.519760793946	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.352648421309	And you know what?
0.0	0.4639746918	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.424807111685	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.849984444502	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.10231634845	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.358600458093	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.373356688056	We do.
0.0	0.480158177664	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.232225143725	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
1.0	0.603744267571	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.0454864339458	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.5	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.685628827794	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.578966229918	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.136680057128	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.382091562558	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.463679037502	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.447581282945	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.312286212551	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.556330751731	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.482957565267	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.21795102974	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.292063938603	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.653221025894	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.219500532637	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.447605171406	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.342701877695	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.389774153508	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.369884008716	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.5	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.481816762558	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.683040343487	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.396498728422	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.329825594653	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.240171433338	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.5	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.333614382454	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.3940070067	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.270743956441	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.318574655824	No.
0.0	0.589535339105	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.473756971683	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.312394871698	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.385956839753	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.267823852465	I don't like that.
0.0	0.382698268316	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.381099408773	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.62638496527	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.260643256593	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
1.0	0.849599197151	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.159183382044	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.410448146778	That's my bill.
0.0	0.424186086004	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.303395806957	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.470068452587	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.505941319178	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.521949063454	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.847639326414	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.293723637986	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.467924348881	I didn't.
0.0	0.224433636562	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.447318436501	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.476476296153	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.238778360956	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.429615489806	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.391351662194	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.238796239384	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.0509893224698	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.342678550682	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.383354362392	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.422677833538	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.218843999747	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.25945635603	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.335454736446	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
1.0	0.775419628538	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.517881201274	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.332130177645	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.285801622224	I want security.
0.0	0.459706604617	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.391008941815	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.276837007091	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.462191573956	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.170675219977	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.0979086640501	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.576211843581	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.69381734458	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.321073676252	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.12517590088	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.289675765749	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.486865293539	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.368362601312	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
1.0	0.551139822656	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.885704713531	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.176091006941	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.607293042887	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.429766263031	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.133846197682	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.419576628232	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.681760988816	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.210656869847	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.44237205183	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.368996055131	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.0979517736579	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.413391835846	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.463208874483	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.613409306902	The problem is we never get it done.
1.0	0.554593654239	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.110027940687	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.353159906585	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.511689557421	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.555307733773	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.339925579257	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.477679216817	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.45894340111	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.487973597192	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.612114219896	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.525681537885	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.09947647719	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.115868304474	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.351504894953	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.287818370452	I like it.
0.0	0.418070095841	You target the bad guys.
1.0	0.659375610723	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.205609258212	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.423600248207	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.276965412143	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.212715678573	...John...
0.0	0.352788476205	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.281281328594	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.554050404472	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.606022579309	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.576818533155	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.226094196375	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.603250655499	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.0619272680447	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.823935774813	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.49260626974	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.571111854346	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.539375682594	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.355475101906	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.199306581383	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.377850664466	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.80178534008	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.190269584259	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.691188334006	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.484269524961	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.180412874237	No -- no...
0.0	0.820502707776	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.379524668696	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.39505785662	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.3348756026	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.713139186972	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.761241280618	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.644936559856	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.250075486465	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.593334199328	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.619664732058	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.546233961243	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.396701174078	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.245535908774	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.796851463125	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.298452419626	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.622414475217	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.313613252342	I think he would have been right.
1.0	0.358494283092	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.477092635793	I never said that.
0.0	0.475270513321	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.329103396263	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.344229068617	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.37115271158	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.300671042901	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.

0.0	0.314716160763	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.373489853221	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.

0.0	0.404079366591	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.0976348477041	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.257129474381	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.

0.0	0.399725442747	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.388119741618	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.482241130934	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.449684037425	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.467579805622	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.737934636492	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.237714721858	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.248883544188	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.345300899801	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.219957576978	...
0.0	0.319974700132	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.149662026851	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
1.0	0.924478967603	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.232516957339	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.323604513106	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.535157604961	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.485898483456	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.312017720212	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.214736077115	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.537537668761	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.52732419036	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.293359999376	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.479149544548	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.3028247429	This will end.
0.0	0.297681607815	Think about that.
0.0	0.386736409811	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.290123844645	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.397207131976	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.193566309761	It's true.
0.0	0.438039141631	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.220353200092	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.743768631545	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.375878458097	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.313334444891	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.20181390671	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.328915408916	You're welcome.
0.0	0.317295664827	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.830433776587	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.543488682653	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.508745391879	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.114245451215	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.44948249303	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.361969070212	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.237324673891	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.408977133208	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.532790337233	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.213765904016	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.259461335951	You know, let me say something at the outset.
1.0	0.82052932952	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.348982224829	Dynamically.
0.0	0.42743966565	They're very concerned about it.
1.0	0.588198825903	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.0460882395969	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.541190162815	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.681928399076	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.509022556123	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.407085425002	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.0981453538638	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.19391904014	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.213574008892	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.490003520966	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.519644778856	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.526841948917	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.215102714693	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.353502997925	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.359666308345	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.378404763486	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.467453978888	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.556651425418	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.232490662404	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.63851918125	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.313947038811	You know why?
0.0	0.505694383479	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.488438804559	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.20552219125	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.229946238083	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.135072840705	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.445500836673	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.778148807572	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.310829270393	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.359165200011	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.345450008343	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.445184907861	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.392652001344	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.353350906793	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.322464074798	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.591350942819	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.24003312704	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.429178412413	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.5	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.346668674053	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.291897013201	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.511503592802	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.757186178982	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.385664594144	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.181248182265	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.404808648212	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.521960430153	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.402463845608	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.26593729832	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.173491339248	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.357538027376	I think he is right.
0.0	0.0781831740315	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.159457777576	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.613234911226	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.543733611646	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.0603066851439	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.370468587277	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.440591073536	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
1.0	0.659458264985	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.388904393785	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.147787269976	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.5	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
1.0	0.788587208791	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.239310811354	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.11398867656	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.5	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.178237406001	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.57301764605	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.579390573294	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.317683391357	I love China.
0.0	0.587849520639	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.618488075306	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.382828962552	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.332277853517	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.340998164059	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.33356748275	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.0569324625928	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.528423627496	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.571238912233	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.300726180508	No their not.
0.0	0.581749692875	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.424119898664	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.5	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.510637975218	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.509857688266	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.5319979877	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.123094837091	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.400158505094	That's good.
0.0	0.868967621201	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.428894094172	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.539633211759	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.541193425074	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
1.0	0.645826947619	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.544036719517	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.543187939743	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.214512614432	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.465872085431	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.5	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.576863767527	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.51731899316	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.645824008922	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.357869213833	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.349122466189	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.111902236379	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.519198437713	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.441519923707	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.676315393297	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.365934704963	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.250318714124	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.16774038125	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.448781006048	We need security.
0.0	0.246457878353	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.358602833164	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.233466306989	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.456599576977	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.251297862427	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.187247445839	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.48279944806	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.676879765796	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.437788588992	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.334047585098	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.349136123936	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.360494103622	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.58973109136	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.0810006553816	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.400362171465	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.285146418843	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.60858933796	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.625413742056	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.746345869883	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.590330714881	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.179265234328	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.489696063761	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.348990608902	OK.
0.0	0.304903168024	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.406849154214	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.348990608902	Yeah.
0.0	0.260152171612	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.230310573919	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.365424695837	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.561005767221	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.36866793648	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.552234743055	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.436471062182	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.0773255635282	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
1.0	0.766861235748	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.384403281038	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.51051231403	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.293506155605	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.404870518942	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.426017179859	It goes away.
0.0	0.541786567829	And that was the state of Texas.

0.0	0.404617117531	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.534718233167	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.38913803373	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.402569707265	But it is a general economic issue.

0.0	0.479207440956	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.334977068153	But many, many people did.

0.0	0.389881662481	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.462741130555	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
1.0	0.827042461263	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.

0.0	0.182943228052	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.

0.0	0.559647985387	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.273619238383	No, no.
0.0	0.557626320317	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.

0.0	0.626436459619	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.537385771034	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.339359701344	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.5	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.378203036444	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.383347789526	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.334881739479	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.306863123636	Can we stop?
1.0	0.321118116675	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.0816292798368	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.436599941844	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.163132509894	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.368796828559	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.647851851262	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.318574655824	No.
0.0	0.317328525143	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.409116496015	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.526008402672	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
1.0	0.696255661703	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.74047757565	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.171160145063	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.

0.0	0.338934026684	You bet they do.
0.0	0.421799650789	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.278813713819	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.590122231578	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.447769356743	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.578134064117	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.728991448675	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.480608009066	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.719477591213	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.455918986314	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.292391265518	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.53276837496	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.312283890576	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.396747329076	You're right.
0.0	0.360379032616	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.590981184643	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.0922246499799	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.5	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.177815492183	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.335807132796	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.428118186383	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.813727259827	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.569385857539	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.486590272151	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.210042808403	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.348990608902	Yes.
0.0	0.24174260638	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.431526226391	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.0801955196498	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.354664250934	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.247911145976	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.512749672938	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.0367391089712	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.261922349189	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.417124407573	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.234799792992	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.871391509307	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
1.0	0.633727421289	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.378118072128	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.351181537825	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.540173146242	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.5	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.411277212377	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.248185970126	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.463503221322	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.433227424727	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.75108971678	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.203720851913	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.1368160111	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.627360969228	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.387029150669	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.354584794134	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.152869214276	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.348990608902	OK?
0.0	0.336770770936	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.418720733215	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.5	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.313947038811	You know why?
0.0	0.176712882678	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
1.0	0.589391229083	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.17945484085	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.242759260394	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.54801301466	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.348982224829	Absolutely.
0.0	0.447909136733	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.140352378564	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.315582618817	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.463243317569	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.320991250488	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.521487722252	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.208466886061	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.349638746448	I'll say this.
0.0	0.659114780268	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.402718373835	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.355358038521	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.361881376344	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
1.0	0.736721879793	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.225135625323	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.0999985224483	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
1.0	0.6450670472	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.29112223874	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.435874704608	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.0529675722363	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.352572507103	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.667366048512	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.12002876726	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.385060809765	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.137965322385	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.224363151121	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.188238985931	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.362134821103	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.58838129429	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.437900150075	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.372536174418	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.277219086569	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.373356688056	You do.
0.0	0.392665927328	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.420938753991	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.599458789609	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.286546158911	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.633016275238	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.298535070959	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.390257261446	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.763611143967	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.54154749791	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.715948657012	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.298038013055	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.273225729543	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.948637874576	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.216504945528	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.697827546139	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.251276302038	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.657400852695	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.21089494158	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.338119073973	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.391817829361	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.393815303265	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.147640503384	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.716134502684	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.159042777585	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.342234144278	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.422652504913	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.477864926544	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.581419844685	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.670189728071	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.617831660317	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.670479163491	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.506885074825	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.237079074644	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.478591201282	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.348655467085	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.560097684803	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.376148281342	He does great.
1.0	0.603402350744	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.361817976123	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.614177321969	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.447078881497	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.162056160539	No, it's true.
0.0	0.5	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.614757078427	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.546849046374	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.30070847898	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.306626859231	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.692954599628	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.278169682893	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.359487308156	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.179537226968	But look...
0.0	0.320218367195	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.320229166667	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.35089962237	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.403959517921	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.573837304725	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.596142472511	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.852674429286	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.604383174036	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.412349281568	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.669350149386	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.253315108814	He undermines it.
0.0	0.27046052002	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.254760679351	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.208063138324	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.343389806852	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.674042818864	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.245392796308	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.240747861837	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.198829236845	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.360330576916	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.293300052195	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.41859292776	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.418656774512	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.657149879568	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.455180352825	They're a scam.
0.0	0.180638431919	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.540170357281	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.287645999013	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.344284860843	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.294789260888	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.15319126159	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.336288764837	Think about it.
0.0	0.675639492844	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.291767458781	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.472425992925	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.236259852576	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.701975958123	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.211586753045	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.454372762602	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.494321125074	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.465167655632	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.110957991725	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.374726479607	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.40156325787	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.267981413194	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.490599771276	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.415287070787	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.557488307138	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.545466885225	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.625507342597	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.57416102642	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.606178029801	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.213203954708	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
1.0	0.395678563355	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.3053393866	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.335718130962	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.178600789358	I agree with them.
0.0	0.31518321557	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.544108061025	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.298843295848	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.477352455243	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.390375532427	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.446581591324	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.623840444549	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.377402849676	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.0655684625353	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.26544553514	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.463016856974	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.474794148572	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.612703745885	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.187181232903	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.280148563932	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.347740117397	About Medicare?
0.0	0.867903385777	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.414553271389	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.278709127562	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.835926191618	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.38286284551	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.349657139952	And for good cause.
1.0	0.72842125658	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.422465086981	He's wrong.
0.0	0.693328811928	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.581750685535	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.352648421309	But you know what?
0.0	0.314466019246	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.285685875601	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.561382424379	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.575521718542	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.438429596084	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.143817398021	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.275812486872	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.323531566505	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.329212389452	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.150724140334	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.205970454501	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.514944736517	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.282098905484	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.334915211109	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.434374548281	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.5	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.27683457773	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.348850977285	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.391600002053	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.409381616234	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.372068586094	I will not do that.
0.0	0.567750386577	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.475262631538	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
1.0	0.765712836638	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.646203935257	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.475497843565	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.0344964021156	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.426017179859	It never happens.
0.0	0.3717365097	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
1.0	0.587334554915	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.405955927648	That's what we need.
0.0	0.394129631226	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.333031039305	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
1.0	0.5	They stole it.
0.0	0.485271958973	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.294286921687	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.357658718595	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.544232912864	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.248646485773	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.740978142571	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.653383147011	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.300819608487	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.342862320578	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.464754255678	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.319635230804	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.7640268894	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.246015532546	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.290624170603	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.19483242721	We're running.
0.0	0.818450893547	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.443081133451	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.431362554165	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.318574655824	No.
0.0	0.440255936149	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.348990608902	OK.
0.0	0.252321506854	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.347674764345	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.665514917744	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.389562217702	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.349068313392	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.739742550988	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.553206917091	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.76749616645	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.201923600314	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.132323616597	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.341680149835	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.381616176161	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.330463133626	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.354027563635	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.44506363616	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.628276883093	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.477098638835	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.580663011082	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.187391276704	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.492833621236	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.357656129524	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.628343999899	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.472705448357	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.379968517819	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.515969323476	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.244267085291	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.705596941404	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.428963075243	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.234834935407	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.34300466427	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.455719413102	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.540933118317	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.848719121952	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.464781286478	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.5	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.309673129076	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.5	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.350019506105	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.340071782551	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.136828547088	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.256215620502	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.472341321247	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.621837136852	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.629132950204	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.308319069419	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.567714453965	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.43490684336	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.62010524039	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.618541759881	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.321372469419	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.212629602466	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.619376695819	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.394388220725	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.519621225248	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.224394852427	The number of women --

0.0	0.258889844349	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.261225749696	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.688520926289	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.138619272492	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.21171927505	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.368349333598	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.475406138054	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.335242217571	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.205403417875	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.0994907218259	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.516954242762	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.886652354703	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.147368879952	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.19441962786	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.300850668178	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.655795524296	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.426017179859	It never happens.
0.0	0.0421985162906	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.742468061822	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.275575443926	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.720313949216	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.526655687919	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.248104067542	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.416429719869	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.383562184526	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.111468076115	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.779786530113	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.294407783741	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.773725355569	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.398721636231	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.224526009007	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.526249284404	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.743737696887	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.323039687174	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.512901444859	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.343140539962	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.688671341591	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.373983810687	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.141138345422	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.15548213043	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.476214672797	We were wrong.
0.0	0.531553987485	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.346519151481	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.221396752605	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.437714460397	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.645772812318	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.217365627882	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.438594933939	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.37436907856	I'm just saying.
1.0	0.434548961516	That's wrong.
0.0	0.490423660643	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.204703752651	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.552933372026	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.338451825713	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.116785003087	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.635299865489	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.214749066683	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.511811151218	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.354499211231	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.787805191923	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.528162898214	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.152629359091	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.407188242459	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.37941819273	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.219957576978	...
0.0	0.446615552627	Just for the record.
0.0	0.414168913091	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.382301702732	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.186901453846	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.24787790165	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.228192772076	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.303210181458	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.338859419881	We can't do it.
0.0	0.312850096063	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.788856775848	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.418080832595	You looking at me?
0.0	0.524867043459	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.597093634803	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.442798530362	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.152811471838	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.239672355562	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.384194880169	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.578385773594	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.65060010278	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.187548668791	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.171381959675	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.219303623575	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.461901039012	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.507968048034	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.242588172663	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.253401078799	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.268979558817	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.158311200011	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.206222363683	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.186248615956	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.597533832007	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.260262250806	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.5	We need sound money.
0.0	0.222650280123	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.247215081876	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.0534894171718	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.596329191438	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.317778604776	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.575150645989	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.545873693807	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.143892080795	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.675682066429	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.543857331343	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.32853716175	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.542193083177	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.191436515319	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.703613195527	The world has changed.
0.0	0.358801563247	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.510646440647	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.274791405513	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.505873507384	So we need 1,000.
1.0	0.801604970495	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.519760793946	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.593644375094	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.480317165463	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.36161688344	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.396347422987	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
1.0	0.456294892431	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.365360534497	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.150715470556	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.122307142829	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.292454415396	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.323300724643	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.113246628467	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.393574702533	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.299224740875	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.795630863774	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.193187446465	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.534464818072	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.614092561725	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.573088683697	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.5	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.279334573921	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.413052029118	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.48191103429	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.238401742467	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.531186437527	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.237047858185	We have no borders.
0.0	0.363463489424	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.368905814843	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.541320253301	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.386563153157	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
1.0	0.433138561863	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.330869380917	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.362555266523	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.630158895161	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.32100441676	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.397244071041	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.5	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.333154662915	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.791594783883	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.397537045251	I have no idea.
0.0	0.470576396391	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.430940803516	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.5	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.335985025495	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.471967534529	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.374740758397	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.667232996522	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.574100175917	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.602294537278	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.391472227664	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.776464475362	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.49474924864	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.0933220215963	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.372476080732	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.615839325986	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.221342060919	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.394763885534	That is not right.
0.0	0.751345394629	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.385446973746	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.243980822738	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.203341507926	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.5	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.28440212549	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.252895051985	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.265996898712	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.25382440571	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.429279478995	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.254995102034	Maria...
0.0	0.636162371497	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.532878026595	There was nothing to this birther issue.

0.0	0.490453686864	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.627118489716	This isn't the governments money.

0.0	0.265154860689	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.544003531344	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.556329956723	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.586778083134	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.

0.0	0.662394554561	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.

0.0	0.0571463301592	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.467579805622	They go to Yale.

0.0	0.528365071841	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.791905397287	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.244276301339	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.201432535778	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.268229835822	But I would add this.
0.0	0.5	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.286440385977	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.240468404028	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.

0.0	0.245852203165	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.381863649866	I can govern by bringing people together.

0.0	0.376527505303	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.50869315476	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.689620202138	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.569607612468	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.741477034643	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.697551160277	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.137223940172	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.133143999977	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.199669106825	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.439274588967	So you know what?
0.0	0.541816144424	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.334037801293	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.15192599114	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.158894377559	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.384194880169	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.611672819583	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.464698361096	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.844596039471	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.488549244076	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.44237205183	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.523906795302	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.172221044081	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.434973406426	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.235741435318	Check it out.
0.0	0.780300614239	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.441925831656	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.544003531344	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
1.0	0.606416498004	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.78900371434	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.208673390513	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.474697251979	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.21052079147	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.525010502326	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.21327967184	You count on it.
0.0	0.475828605238	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.601853202872	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.192164956735	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.417178231811	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.556641382159	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.16061960516	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.663691684477	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.191132499751	And why?
0.0	0.5	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.585725781731	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.440373019104	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.176712882678	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.343453416178	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.132816777838	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.465989993913	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.367758187427	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.559396393899	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.562235731956	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.335541388401	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.866625871553	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.417290939983	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.431907076311	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.454619460177	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.490799593862	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.300539270547	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.349103973487	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.24802729337	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.108699498751	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.442923391238	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.568241723153	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.698142973792	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.681771167238	You know, I won two record elections.

0.0	0.41510765051	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?

0.0	0.505553171006	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.412664759407	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.567386737763	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.398674218031	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.5	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.628543707745	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.0980787580584	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.306620090854	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.999999067358	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.

0.0	0.285532074194	The answer is no.

0.0	0.315247728902	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.5	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.

0.0	0.0952974696292	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.622449864816	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.597429249317	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.430059017132	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.

0.0	0.448810442588	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.

0.0	0.58578292649	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.348982224829	Right.
0.0	0.267823852465	They don't like that.
0.0	0.577024513573	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.5	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.309700775887	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.

0.0	0.281438372946	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
1.0	0.515153164193	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.154858678351	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.140238149738	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.206096580263	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
1.0	0.659367837238	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.224121337216	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.442150249111	People aren't dumb.

0.0	0.442894227431	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.360780070545	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.

0.0	0.989178003721	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.310377177904	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.

0.0	0.800579104357	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.485558333249	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.539800948785	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?

0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.429073729623	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.388005935326	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.448514069884	That never works.
0.0	0.435273176423	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.494479125754	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.0471616972025	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.370693852457	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.381120867586	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.349190633682	Appreciate it.
1.0	0.807767304252	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.22636129673	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.343594173135	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.426295479371	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.457125351829	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.155355271709	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.529134728683	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.778148807572	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.0624297494462	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.177179107446	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.0598670835778	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.206055787363	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.256450992108	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.738457793077	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.212077185576	I think you're --
0.0	0.446425261241	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.362356376777	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.449579813695	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.361865741351	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.608864271927	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.893298956488	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.123947784396	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.474828261924	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.31725428971	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.900329005853	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.687367708923	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.180147494876	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.419225404025	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.183996252075	Came out great.
0.0	0.340232165005	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.102208426977	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.528458899073	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.165160478792	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.242870831481	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.231608650225	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.5	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.479848695947	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.420816835527	Well, I did.
0.0	0.303364628676	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.20425064846	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.300621030615	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.4770940559	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.377123152955	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.461516099375	That's the difference.
0.0	0.112527273675	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.350833931491	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.419181442782	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.701919684476	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.410423750789	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.621105898357	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.391982707456	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.0222729463323	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
1.0	0.646513698079	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.727875173662	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.35931876126	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
1.0	0.621449051033	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.389780767089	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.449546937433	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.396747329076	You're right.
0.0	0.179043662286	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.395016111	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.286587852401	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.212541767516	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.508530162661	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.432169386077	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.645272012177	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.43158018638	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.490578911828	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.377127876979	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.373356688056	I have.
0.0	0.45544244775	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.429793555266	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.438033591967	We actually did it.
0.0	0.168828729113	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.449229874906	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.547040821918	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.410583980875	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.296142533083	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.331833732644	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.451126258271	to save a company.
0.0	0.515832838569	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.400554269712	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.465068496154	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.245766579077	We hear a lot of good plans.
1.0	0.730552933226	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.555997309807	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.277502250091	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.0896341634326	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.

0.0	0.548822048947	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.311659910843	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.

0.0	0.105645228936	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.370665251057	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.674556246338	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.

0.0	0.313463416748	Neil, I was mentioned too.

0.0	0.340171106028	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.

0.0	0.33353237112	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.379990032999	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.45190903235	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.507472631469	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.579619009346	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.574707765746	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.387922173571	That's not true.
0.0	0.317675052217	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.5	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.480133659567	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.433846121286	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.265818926873	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.400008054006	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.487847051678	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.627181457028	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.00966603967639	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.289806334512	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.234898424782	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.23393661558	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.565753764732	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.445203321018	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.597009139193	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.467563920268	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.881410581472	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.570542587552	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.427805520474	Yeah, they are unhinged.
1.0	0.79960547628	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.281062359163	Or would you rather take less later on?
1.0	0.353868709348	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.481908035329	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.369887624467	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.29905269444	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.339171768847	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.174109267253	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.479823528287	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.477092635793	I never said that.
0.0	0.639680653874	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.666902982372	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.414985271164	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.322588035554	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.448788481746	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.33901237609	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.238673849237	And you can't do that to the party.
1.0	0.490271276325	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.658986985939	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.795834600901	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.127746331941	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.296641151447	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.30780472277	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.59538883158	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.349904757428	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.305811531226	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.356325561514	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.425819416751	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.422963317088	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
1.0	0.901926604579	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.315831366597	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
1.0	0.578264569174	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.447976038448	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.487460717212	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.531942773476	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.492692213781	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.596682085928	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.727333868138	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.220719328044	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.304776473416	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.157017978405	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.204837343222	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.366398693539	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.72334796294	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.172794675471	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.394763885534	That's not right.
0.0	0.494202838013	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.779321982778	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.695636237483	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.205651186478	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.87031624961	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.433686783739	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.377764016823	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.219957576978	...
0.0	0.321535637607	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.537092445851	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.425089822746	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.332233378708	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.210904007665	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.410346054515	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.470826361173	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.642459262913	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.341449561793	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.5	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.459327874776	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.379806539224	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.637127740313	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.119789657649	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.423240868865	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.568954500395	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.230208717535	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.293796228067	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.38478176851	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.308723093666	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.321827917807	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.376864064427	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.695913982394	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.0613952330233	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.404710795292	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.412190244812	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.570845795221	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.400047416808	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.673221887749	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.247411876868	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.219714425931	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
1.0	0.6788925063	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.226566980589	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.163373210672	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.388030754159	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.192622032947	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.701069911972	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.532006076342	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.665302078331	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.344498030937	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.407054988499	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.942955471821	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.434252844666	We are not France.
0.0	0.283959028933	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.0802583864105	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.55588035555	He was on the board.
0.0	0.306116409136	Wait for what?
0.0	0.315328804921	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.446127710454	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.383653587118	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.335438912305	Well, you know what I'm worried about?

0.0	0.396747329076	We haven't.
0.0	0.109022789679	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.0226756379722	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.339197701559	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.127280998561	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
1.0	0.5	It isn't there anymore, Mike.

0.0	0.444252361142	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.394823451819	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.573109388804	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.527767812043	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.100038700778	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.5	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.152844194488	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.558776176801	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.34673079819	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.590913601398	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.561556210729	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.596022150491	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.33772579664	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.296294762912	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.476594939689	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.663063625543	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.

0.0	0.855397484049	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.588256717391	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.317504877936	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.53758034562	Two points.
0.0	0.365529571045	Creativity.
1.0	0.803529029167	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.373356688056	I do.
0.0	0.2101842918	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.165666358617	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.480033712819	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.540244629469	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.260892394324	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.412540833716	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.348990608902	Yeah.
0.0	0.873476702249	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.643126149118	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.155385047801	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.426146588567	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.535908514231	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.87968033088	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.

0.0	0.404427028032	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.0181558194222	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.539788274088	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.148196392455	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.081955241196	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.623789844895	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.298702926124	I like Marco Rubio.

0.0	0.713814875761	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.277184243081	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.399105262618	What you need to do is free up interest rates.

0.0	0.650339271892	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.345071344629	How great is that?
0.0	0.297721295457	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.

0.0	0.167283135418	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.280507510682	How about this?
0.0	0.417483726526	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.459198066769	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.

0.0	0.58236822974	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.

0.0	0.244390307076	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.637245138109	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.172925282338	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.342809335913	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.366293236936	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.

0.0	0.528879961617	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.537270456684	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.

0.0	0.405756501678	You have to lead.
0.0	0.178005682465	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.52881207832	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.384193491595	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.269714859672	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.265071118994	Why?
0.0	0.400527448181	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
1.0	0.470529274631	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.191351380849	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.261687321844	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.67528547735	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.313252129997	They know.
0.0	0.474454170504	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.119526987409	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.267823852465	We don't need that.
0.0	0.210399443545	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.82377974348	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.604560974393	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.631185863832	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.65275216685	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.300037528649	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.114147338257	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.348990608902	Okay.
0.0	0.538678561407	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.170069180542	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
1.0	0.6593891248	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.541614217376	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.843261745641	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.460322339429	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.664568242479	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.37588020291	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.313016956352	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.611976016079	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.259907147342	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.648088302525	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.891712032186	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.368779706726	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.4781734442	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.783796322907	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.405755969922	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.485200285309	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.506670511086	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.219754055748	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.220719328044	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.540220520848	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.559777395199	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.184092948593	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.348990608902	OK?
0.0	0.330913796323	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.440439887326	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.520993384263	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.167858664472	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.732276012325	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.559388918641	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.395622698241	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.433562600329	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.54149993896	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.331448594622	I will run on my record all day long.
1.0	0.645191477245	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.467924348881	She was right.
0.0	0.422444879861	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.366373563002	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.333744864795	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.113515689214	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.133690237066	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.46044090148	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.274060518084	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.431088596094	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.5	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.416112075665	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.201775409115	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.293128600076	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.434898682078	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.559823807859	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.1368160111	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.394514319031	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.4448222561	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.38161646643	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.308980894606	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.405759414552	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.576129245168	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.756654722501	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.362889064455	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.216589830957	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.396747329076	You get together.
0.0	0.404981786588	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.410479462726	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.317449767032	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.784575642423	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.478697533618	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.561409292977	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.336946719766	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.191662360837	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.356411353726	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.278674797869	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.5	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.521291301748	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.410502528612	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.36200347098	I would change them.
0.0	0.71251668994	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.524797818755	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.429400032726	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.511632365857	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.15438853074	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.201090798559	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.521485844049	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.205138264182	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.038425246431	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.265975096014	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.233444444704	I've laid out...
0.0	0.786989257246	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.349087847396	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.511938224961	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.401348340065	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.777183916707	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.261661922939	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.304680805173	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.491573955023	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.393132919632	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.688000151147	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.457468353972	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.361592222723	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.341010849451	Say again?
0.0	0.386258789833	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.644317197732	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.317412031437	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.482460260283	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.560148821997	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.461446971248	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.282104350418	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.31758538462	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.532626381568	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.283405688863	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.30983101702	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.399561618448	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
1.0	0.507857960117	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.446939963156	I was not at all.
0.0	0.766083713975	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.480473287716	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.356125737543	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.708402913949	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.894645904586	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.729590498485	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.196896455995	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.5352158325	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.308515426215	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.0798410208693	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.414299608649	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.130625606622	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.488000585193	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.288573116379	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.146180990397	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.0568149527379	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.285121542055	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.484484622945	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.23880265464	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.703444736642	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.273877127822	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.290614566559	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.17330553797	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.478104205918	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.421873745528	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.467817240676	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.362661346095	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.372587713053	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.174094330044	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.462317606404	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.439265094229	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.252430047502	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.804153985739	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.306071843082	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.811314343994	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
1.0	0.521124141218	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.622697613907	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.864503182873	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.309147622618	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
1.0	0.670719181565	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.389263532679	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.850079176552	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.472597416795	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.0808517544761	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.456407930654	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.197664302334	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.288239683769	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.492352253184	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.511235359486	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.195297637227	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.407144219511	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.322830041759	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.387361905182	We have to do something.
0.0	0.0891785951987	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.524328157566	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.555778496815	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.307984425042	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.360763909193	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.819204802004	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.0871544536513	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.160859454653	And...
0.0	0.253813486124	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.430520606818	I got that.
0.0	0.491431095582	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.310994824791	No, John.
0.0	0.065771051345	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
1.0	0.563669794653	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.271013363495	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.987863452966	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.335304491616	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.348990608902	Yes.
0.0	0.56777291296	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.867844503117	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.183598143465	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.445467966693	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.319033097681	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
1.0	0.879295701117	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.478178238542	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.359490905916	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?

0.0	0.277847552013	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.303315163487	That's for sure.
0.0	0.230501938154	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.273139359123	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.279564469653	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.768586458166	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.17093845058	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.120832183895	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.255265790156	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.321884443983	So you might not.
0.0	0.177139225482	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.256601216367	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.383446390698	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.290837598041	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.

0.0	0.268180941145	But I think they will see a very good option here.
1.0	0.745925247973	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.155738934625	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.246213833036	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.437957093395	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.506052011555	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.

0.0	0.444021503667	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.506853800286	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.345975806123	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.118106637753	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.483007117122	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.416050433245	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.26789363208	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.513318654851	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.348982224829	Right.
0.0	0.422653966141	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.406886184095	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.365817056369	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.474649103469	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.250132877849	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.601232764943	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.792940016966	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.509051431316	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.217922545581	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.123667643531	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.473779535735	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.596505907522	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.368007007627	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.287512778507	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.

0.0	0.17801817481	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.523855650297	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.787551967432	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.203124124341	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.379686821868	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.159904490423	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.52770340873	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.378257669149	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.507476369657	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.677169815398	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.439653535541	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.143979332434	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.613164626567	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.234520237534	It feels different.
0.0	0.508181313556	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.119106755909	And guess what?
0.0	0.328735533425	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.745049978066	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.312805001983	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
1.0	0.448031279815	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.67170246654	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.101496597277	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.407270263561	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.386391952012	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.458758193955	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.265903434309	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.536049009091	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.101228908699	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.284289089919	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.301911234328	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.520607508489	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.244189066653	How do I know this?
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.354484302514	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.525350865938	We came back from the dead.

0.0	0.207187991743	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.129335628323	And here's the last piece...

0.0	0.200266894757	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.305830880772	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.450570355559	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.111923364143	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.5	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.

0.0	0.361191346062	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.394721829696	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.

0.0	0.348594528226	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.114532500518	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.581176062724	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.509410232046	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.197323347687	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.465468268326	You know why three?
0.0	0.360060680162	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.261348538827	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.394055160598	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.340129522228	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.3614688355	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.288598257651	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.3662704753	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.159684394459	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.412862107192	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.358616586672	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.449156350967	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.431208236684	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.262167796375	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.278425820882	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.536402592704	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.980569671189	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.316034250485	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.

0.0	0.479238985912	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.441630942472	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.5	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.410253012024	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.715303533058	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.434105719603	He's wrong.
0.0	0.475304773449	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.

0.0	0.360941040375	Alright.
1.0	0.659355172774	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.

0.0	0.76489966516	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.

=======================================================

Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them. Because now he's going a little bit better. You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration. But they can't get along. Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom. They do whatever what they do, OK. This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family. If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed. The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates. We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC? If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent. And you can go get it at jeb2016.com. And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry. We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money. Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well. Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline. They shouldn't be going to Europe. The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary. ... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down. And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people. Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration? Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt. Thank you all very much. I will show you what they do to women. I think the times are much more serious. But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media. And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest. That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses. If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out. So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And, this is what I am finding throughout America. Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state. This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job. And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors. And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it. I mean, just think about a scenario like that. As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress. In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate. So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people. In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward. I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families. One thing I want to be clear about tonight. I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week? They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees. Let's quit making it a problem for them. For 30 years this country has been baited with that. Nine months ago, our campaign began. And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth. If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship -- Those of you health savings accounts. We need Jordan. ... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald... But the poll numbers have. Absolutely. He's penalized -- and doesn't understand. So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters. You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes. I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry. But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself. I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again. That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does. I hope the Supreme Court upholds them. I'll give you a fact. Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office. It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio. I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America. These... It was a terrible sight. But the voters are savvier than that. I have... That's a blessing. She said the truth. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it. The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal. You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt. I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it. I looked at the evidence. (LAUGHTER) It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them. I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus. Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel. The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times. And I think together we will make progress. Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else. And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine. And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so. Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries. You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this. And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results. Thank you. Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies. You know, that's so simple. We borrow a million dollars a minute. And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker? Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind. Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do. I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them. If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you. But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments. So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic. Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon. Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless. So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose. If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending. I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile. Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer? The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C.. You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation. Do we still have standards? I can. And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done. It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up. Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people. Half of them had tears pouring down their face. Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength. And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. He has never defended... And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us. They are refusing to... They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it. ...and be held accountable. By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership. Right. First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe. Thank you. It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book. Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa? In fact, he's done worse than nothing. And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years. No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me. And I think that ought to be worth something. Thank you. When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling. And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective. That's how you make peace in the world. You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt. We had Hezbollah. He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore. Well, Rick, it's a very important question. When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion. Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it. If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from? It's never been that way in American politics before. And let me make a final point on this. If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is. And I ended a federal entitlement. That is what I believe. So we have a good group of people. And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina. The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms. This is the first priority. So I would -- I would be willing to do that. We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi. He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not... No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items. There are many lawyers. Well, first of all, thank you all for having us. It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm. I'm tested. No, I didn't care (inaudible). I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years. I was not at all critical of him. It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms. I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama. You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want. But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt. And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it. I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee. We need to bring people together in Washington. I like that. And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back. We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law. It enables us to eliminate the death tax. Japan, the same thing. The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years. Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees. And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth. I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States. It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon. What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas. Because it wouldn't work. His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax, And I would not stand for that as president of the United States. And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers. And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs. Do I take the product? It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives. And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book. We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back. in particular. And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders. So I have voiced criticisms. The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people. It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money. We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president. You've got to bring people together. Neil... Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together. While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics. ...income tax... So it wasn't just me who opposed it. What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out. The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. I've got five grandkids. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun. They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in. ... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America. Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union. When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. But judgment matters as well. Well, let me tell you this. And I say that to Nikki. This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region. ... Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton? They want those planes made in China. I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America. First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport. Well, that's easy to answer. How do we decide on who gets to follow up? Our country is being run by incompetent people. It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in. But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been. Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty. King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel. I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding. At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them. One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration. Run the company kids, have a good time. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China. It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason. And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem. It turns out we knew something was wrong. Unless you are clinically insane... I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry. The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. Here's the deal, Chris is totally right. And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish. Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations... They've been beaten into submission. You see, folks, this is how socialism starts. We can do that in Washington. We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies. We have a lot of work to do. Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport. Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee. That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico. Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this. Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this. That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. We need somebody who can lead. We need a doer, not a talker. And again, paid for. I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually. Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive. There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments. They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them. ... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him. We need to reverse that. In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient. ... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard. But here's the best solution of all. And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that. It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000. When we do business with China, they tax us. I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it. We lose on trade. Number one, you have people in this country that... Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election. I suspect you may have. One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime. I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever. Thank you. So let's set the facts straight. And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families. I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard. It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on? This country is changing. We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again. No. You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover. And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means. We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion. But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect. The economy was really booming. And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job. To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government? We will work with our Sunni allies. In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer. I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people. Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind. They get -- they steal them. I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month. And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad. Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us. Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living. And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers. Oh, I'll talk about that, too. We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists. It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before. Now, Donald... To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that. I would also just say this. But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems. On welfare. We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt. It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda. I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office. That makes no sense to everybody. That's not right. Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations. Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen. I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run. Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront. And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran. A brief response. And Lehman Brothers started it all. Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen. I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues. Just a little bit. What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods. If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them. I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to. Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families? And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which. The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America. When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight. As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race. Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training. When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. I was governor of New York on September 11. Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat. I am passionate about what I believe. We've already got a great talker in the White House. Take it from your professors... And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance. This is the fantasy... I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?" Here's the way you need to deal with it. The planes are older than the pilots. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement. That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that. Play by the rules. And God bless America. And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous. I will do so in a way that will bring people together. Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high. I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes. Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy. Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb. Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show. And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare." Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again... They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people. Here's -- here's our plan. ... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory. I want to reverse that decline. They were paid speeches. I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton. But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws. Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder. I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers. It's not theirs anymore. My price tag is about $100 billion a year. That's the end of the conversation. You get the Senate. No criminal records for them. And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything. If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers. I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported. I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us. Folks, you want to -- Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today. I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV. You want me to answer that question? They're very, very badly wounded. And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment. You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there. And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this. They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this. It's a hard problem. The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed. I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me. Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements. We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again. Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it. And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people. You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great. And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country. And if I could say just one thing. The Democrats can't even come up with one. And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves. I've been there 35 times. We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down. Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at. We're going to start the process of securing that border. And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi. We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics. Let's allow companies to immediately expense. We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country. What we need to do is destroy ISIS. And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform. And yes, it was a very difficult time. CRUZL But I will say -- Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job. That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away. I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years. One of them is a statewide use of deadly force. Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football? You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare. They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty. You've got to keep asking. And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed. Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude. And they came back with 23 recommendations. There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people. That is not protected free speech. This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea. The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done. ...eliminates the business... -- fix America, this is the formula. ... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge. Well, I respectfully disagree. I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid. Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor. Are you serious about this election? On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent. I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism. But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies. When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well. You gotta be creative and imaginative. My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion. This is a country that is of, for and by the people. And the last piece is this. The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. As a senator, yes, I was a senator. Marco voted on the other side. And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question. But bottom line is: The president is right. You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again. That is important. And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack. People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York. But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida. I think it's a good product. I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me. And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up. I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car. We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income. We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later? We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract. A growth of 385,000 jobs. Let's hope that it holds. Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve. But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make. Well, Rick, it's a very important question. That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector. And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. It was Countrywide Mortgage. And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments. I know every one. I changed that. It will end on January 2017. We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers. Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger. We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country... That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here. One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go. You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia. I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry. We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms. Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes. Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money. Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest. He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS. I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts. Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas. It's why you see the banks consolidating. Well, yes, indeed. But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed. And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom. We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service. Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. I love this country. The people aren't dumb. See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions. Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us. Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November. I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side. Actually going to do something to help the American worker. The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made. And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what? Edward Snowden is a traitor. Divisive and with no vision. We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country. I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing. Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices. If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states. Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent. I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars. They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them. Nobody can solve it like me. I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military. Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of. You don't want to hear the answer. I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic. No, the new planes. Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court. Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. We are in a war against ISIS. So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls. He just writes out an executive order. Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. He just writes out an order, executive order. Government is the enemy. Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds. Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality. If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know. I don't know where you... OK? Big difference. I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record. So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing. Where did that spirit come from in America? Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration. I've got one more question for you then. You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality. What are the rules on who gets to follow up. You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have. One of your colleagues interviewed me. We will win on everything we do. That was before he was running against me. Can I just add one very quick thing? You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline. And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America. If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead. And it's not the folks on Wall Street. We need to reform Social Security. Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it. Get over that one, OK? They didn't do that. We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before. We have a tremendous problem. But what happened is a political vacuum developed. What have you got now? Do we still have values and principles? Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion. We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer. So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago. So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China. There's -- look, there's -- And, the fact is, none of them. No. We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country. Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes. To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out. I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold. There is no money in the Medicare account. Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent. And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion. This is what's going on. All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government. I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them. These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours. Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state. Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers. And in fact I would go further. I would change them. Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question. It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns." The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you. And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster. It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one. Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood. No, he doesn't. Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions? I win. Since I was attacked too. He hit oil. You have to have certainty. But we are where we are right now. You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups. John. ...numerically, it's gonna be higher. I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt. They are trying to attack us here in America. We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest. I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate. I mean, that's just the bottom line. And I'm glad I did it. ...Then I'll buy you a tequila... I'd consider it. You didn't see it for a minute. Work requirements and time limits. So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities. I had to work my way through school. Let me say on that... So... And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office... What -- what -- you're from New York? Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids. He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country." It is undermining American democracy. You're going away for a long, long while. Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well. (LAUGHTER) All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration. I have got deep concerns about the Fed. The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed. And you know, he's right. But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about. (BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation. Why in God's name does Wall Street... We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline. 1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs. We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly. Right. And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem. And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party. Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people. So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision. Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account. Think about it. We have been talking about it for decades. No, not at all, absolutely not. And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future. And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them. I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election. For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us. I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper. You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington. When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size. It will lead to even greater war in this world. And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars. ... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future. Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas. Are you coming onboard a proposal? We're going to create a border. And that doesn't have to be true. Maria, I assume that I can respond to that. He wasn't my senator. Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org. But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid... Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program. In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation. We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results. If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by. -- work better to lift everyone up, men and women. I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions. Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not. And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden. You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. ...No, sir... It's driving up stock prices. Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America. I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget. With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part. That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is. I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential. And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it." But we're running for the presidency of the United States here. Of course, they would. That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position. That's not the America that I've ever known. I support NAFTA. But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C. We put in place child care support. Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class. But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better. OK? It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut. Our wages are growing faster than the national average. The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel. Ours was intended to be a citizen government. The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year. They're protectionist. My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old. And I mean, are you kidding me? The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you. My mother is on Medicare and Social Security. It was the week she got exposed as a liar. I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China. Bipartisan issue. That's not why I ran for office. I said, absolutely, you can still change the world. But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air. And we need to make that very clear to everybody. I don't recall them calling for his resignation -- Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks. I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers. But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions. ... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers. This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States. So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating? Well, you're talking about -- yeah. And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before... It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger. And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime. She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety. It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks. Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question. They expect to have it. John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here. I'm angry because our country is a mess. We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies. I promise. And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well. We differ, however, on a couple of key points. And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail. And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal. Bill, here's the interesting position on this. Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is. You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us. John? Well, sure. Neil, the problem... Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this. There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day. They're a scam. And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out. Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn. And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people. We don't need newer (ph) laws. You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes. Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? John, I'll tell you something. Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland. Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan. First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do. We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well. They are worried to death about the future of their kids. ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state. Not my kind of guy. I want security for this country. And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America. You know, America doesn't owe me anything. We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution. That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance. The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse. The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites. Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again. You want to talk about moral authority. You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play. Why is that? And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise. And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out. We're not doing it. Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit. But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security. We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore. And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold. This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back. And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe. I'm against anything that's bad for my mother. And it has been a remarkable situation in our state. And who can blame them? Yes. So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists. I understand. And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country. When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria. The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate. We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans. If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans. I didn't find it offensive at all. I have a bill to fix Medicare. You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it... And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt. It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are. Thank you, senator. If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well. And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse. My name was mentioned here. And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today. Here's the problem. You do legislation. And how do I know it? Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education. I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem. That's not even an issue. And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level. And here's why. And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up. There is no other description of it. So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then. No. And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump. My background is different. There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it. Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done. Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns. Well, I've been -- My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did. Now hundreds of companies I've opened. That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office. She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner. But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. ...Chris... We have to put more money. Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed. You're not interested in an answer. This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops. And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this. Yeah, he said everybody. Do people not care about all of our sacrifice? I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone. That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking. My point is this. I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up. The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent. But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong. She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States. Well, I mean right here. You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government. And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt. The answer is yes. And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive. I can't do it. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. I think, though, government is too big now. ...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth. The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration. If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent. Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars. I am against the raids. Very few children. You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill. That's what I said. Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on. They know we will be committed to victory. With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do. Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit. And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them. And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see. And you know what? And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation. Here's the truth. Well, you know what? Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that. And let me say this also. It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight. They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. Let's talk about our campaigns. Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken. I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug. I want a government so small I can barely see it. We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of... You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income. I came as a reformer. Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones. Here's the problem. Here's a fact. They are much more than that. Good at email. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally. I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. I can do that. But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary. We just can't do it any longer. A Republican Congress did that. The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services. And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U. And then what he did is redefine the role of government. Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street. And, we said no. No one is a socialist. They come from another country and they're immediately sent out. That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way. I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves. And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies. She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess. Not everybody remembers that. Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse. I have many friends that deal with China. But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America. Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues. Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well. Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record. See? Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time. See, they don't like that. And you know what? Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone. And we got to look at the big picture here. And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence? I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago. That's gonna be the real growth engine. You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism. I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed. I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years. We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to. I used the tithing analogy. Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered. That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice. We have Dodd-Frank. You can't have a question. We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in. That's what I've always stood for. He is a good man. Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us. And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio. ...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it... That will change everything. We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country. First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations. I mean, I ask that with all due respect. And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America. It's a joke. That's an interesting question. I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000. The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe. But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said? But I was born here. I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill. But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors. And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign. A terrible sight. In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that. We've saved billions of dollars. Thank you. And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be. It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money. Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again. Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight. And that is wrong. We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC. You can have him. And so do I. There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office. So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini. So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS... They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies. The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS. We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions. Or how about Boeing right here within a mile? Now that he is, he's changed his tune. But this is nothing new. Do senators have the right to disagree with the president? I'm not fighting that. I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would. Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now. He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British. They look around for gun-free zones. We need to stop that. We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis. And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face. And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet. That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support. I think that's a major accomplishment. I'm prepared. You know, every election we hear a lot of talk. Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes. But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint. Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck. All right, look, this has been a great debate. And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now. You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you? So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct. I understand we can disagree on the path forward. My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be. The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have. Becky -- You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite. I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority. They don't buy their guns from a collector. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression. And our adversaries continue to grow stronger. Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes. If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief. We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do. You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power. And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said. Low income people who are not involved in the political process. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now. We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree. It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do." They didn't do that either. And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks. You don't have to. I totally get that. Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture. Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again. You can't just ban all Muslims. The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. That has not been... I never said that. I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind. I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality. Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work. Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it. Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan. You do the arithmetic. We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred. I went out and said, it's ridiculous. I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine. I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it. We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected. That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president. That cost gets passed on to the people. Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money? So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money. And I will tell you something that really galls me. We're laughed at all over the world. People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again. They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore. We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades. If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government. We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military. I will do that in Washington. Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border. I want to speak to all our fighting men and women. But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory. I would just say that... That is... They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund. They were wrong. We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt. He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be. We will make America great again. I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him. So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on. So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria. You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it. They understand that there's a national security risk. It's their money. And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country. But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work. Right. That's how you solve the problem. But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them. Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy. That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world. And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other. We have to get the remaining 10. But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics. The time to turn the page is now. I'm proud that I gave him that advice. The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms. ... he's really doing some bad... And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads. I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment. And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries. He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress. Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job. So let's start -- let's start with immigration. That makes the world less peaceful, less safe. If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore. And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders. You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running. You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America? The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems. Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away. Last I heard we lived in a democratic society. They pay tax once overseas. We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare. It's not that hard. But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America. As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America. You're not going to even allow them to come to our country? Well, let's go with three. I didn't say permanently. Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary. And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for. It is a real horror. ... on Larry Tribe. I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it. We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday. See, here's the thing. I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes. They have a responsibility, as well. We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system. Not bad. I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today. You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now. Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job. This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment. Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS. We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations. ... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long. I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here. Not a very pleasant place to be. The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan. I think that is the real key here. And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont. Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage. We've cut 26 percent of our budget. I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind. Thank you. This campaign is not just about electing a president. Again... and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent. Well, let us level with the American people. But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge. (inaudible). And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable. Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future? The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue. You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt. And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign. And you know what? You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about. I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income. We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world. Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk. But here's the point I want to make tonight. We do. But we stuck to our message. This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left. We had a $1.4 trillion deficit. And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise. It's called the mainstream media who every single day... It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS. I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution. And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this. But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality. He's an S corporation. ... the mandates and have a simple flat tax. I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all. -- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country. I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting. I'd like to jump in. Those are the hard numbers. But let me go back to something that's very important. If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond. You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit. But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore? They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others. I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place. If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves. So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government. We need someone to fight for the people. Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. (inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future. And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq. I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is. No. And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars. I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism. And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?" Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them. I don't like that. In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people. I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem. We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally. That's my bill. So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it. Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed. We haven't done so. I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time. Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator. So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage. Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes. I didn't. Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security. Now, you've got Europe. Let em also tell you... Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence. I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac. It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?" So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives. And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that. And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country. I'm president -- look, I've done it once. Everybody is really doing some bad fact... And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top. I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy. In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan. No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents. HEMMER: Wow. I want security. If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules. That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East. And this is not an endeavor that rewards that. The other Arab countries have a role to play in this. Think back to Garland, Texas. And we're talking about fantasy football? I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?" Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008. And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason. We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all... I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare. Atlantic City has gone bad. That's a serious issue that we could work on. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street. The fact is, the reason why... Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular. Yes, it's very simple. And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent? He wants to change America. When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent. Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York." Since I've been mentioned, can I respond? What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place. And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving... At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil. We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations. The problem is we never get it done. It looked like very few women. But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people. The Emanuel AME church killings. He doesn't meet -- here's the difference. In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force. We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control. So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges. What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare. In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics. ... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison. I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing. You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. ...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies. We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington? I like it. You target the bad guys. We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years. I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch. We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively. But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost. ...John... They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence. And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world. It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too. Never been done before, never been done since. I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation. ...is paid -- played fairly. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done. I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War. And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show. The natural next question is who actually has done so. We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before. You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country. I'm aware of that. So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with? I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad. John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer? But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more. We used to win, we don't win anymore. No -- no... And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease. It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more. When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program. When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. Very good people are making very bad decisions right now. You have small businesses in America that are struggling. You know, the Russians wanted to buy time. If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job. So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks. I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage. I'm never going to change my tune. I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week. We can make a stronger program. No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted. I think he would have been right. We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all. I never said that. So there's a lot of balanced interests. Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel -- It ain't going to happen. Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades. They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us. But... We are all frustrated with what China is doing. He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him. I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran. I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees. I saw them come down. Ever. And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan. Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama. We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement. I voted yes to suspend that. ... that's what you say in a primary. Take it to the bank. You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are. They go to Princeton. They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are. We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go. And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world. ... And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals. When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month. And we have to take on ISIS online. Well, this is what I would say. And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions. So there are people watching tonight in business. And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well. -- the governor's absolutely right. Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions? This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about. I love Donald Trump. I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. This will end. Think about that. Everybody just needs to get used to it. We lose, we have a trade imbalance... And make sure you enhance savings in the private market. It's true. But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage. But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States. I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people. You don't have to say that. First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified. And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect. You're welcome. The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran. Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat. We have people out of work. We have a huge mental health problem in this country. ...we need to honor our promises... Let me conclude by just saying this. Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it. I have worked for his re-election. I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record. And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state. We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay. You know, let me say something at the outset. All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago. Dynamically. They're very concerned about it. Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent. We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff -- And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has. Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand. And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up... Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country. I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens. And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income. And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue. But, I would also add this. They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed. We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough. Take it from Lawrence Tribe. I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did. If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it. We'll just clean it up. Thank you. We're not going to dismantle everything. You know why? After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up. And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive. And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich. I know how to do that. Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy. It's not that complicated actually. And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women. You gotta be patient. We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible. We need to rebuild our families. We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game. Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos. So what if mass unemployment exists? I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement. The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up. We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late. Our country doesn't win anymore. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. You can't grow your way out of demographics. We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate. I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program. He's got probably a four or five percent chance. We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system. In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America. That's who's in my mind We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again. President Obama's policing commission came out with some. And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade. It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally. I think he is right. So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up." I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that. The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it. For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true. When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight. You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country. And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe. And this summer, we didn't do that. And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would. It's what I've done or not done, or it's war. Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready. I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare. Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money. I looked at the intelligence. I love China. It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan. They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back. She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P. So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool. Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky. Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need. I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do. Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan. We are borrowing money from China today. No their not. The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes. It's not my PAC. Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it. (APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match. It is a complicated relationship. And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking. And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty. That's good. We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world. And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market. The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up. That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen. Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two. I am not a member of the political class. I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Karen and I have seven children. We sent our Texas ranger recon teams. And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General. I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family. We can't afford another four years of that. Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness. And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations. I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known. Enough on fantasy football. The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border. There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone. There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities. Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us. We need security. I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that. And what is that proposal? This is a humanitarian catastrophe. That's how you go from secretary to CEO. And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about. Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis. Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails. And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this. And he was a managing general partner. The Kurds are our strongest allies. I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote. Now, let me just be clear, John. We were behind where we were today. And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together. Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news. I was a banker and I was proud of it. It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job. So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail. In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found? Now, you can support one now that's very low. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. It's a political Justice Department. OK. That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested. As you too know, I know I built a very great company. Yeah. Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that? And the fact is that that's not a democracy. I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you? That's was hard work. The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true... It's you see the health insurance companies getting together. So we have work to do. First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the -- But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Just ditto to that. So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system. I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement. And I make a lot more than the average American. It goes away. And that was the state of Texas. Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here. My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS. And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice. ... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it. But it is a general economic issue. But in 2015, we have a very different economy. Our healthcare is a horror show. My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country. All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure. Yes, our allies are not perfect. I'm 44 years old. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground. Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs. I strongly support the president's executive actions. But many, many people did. And it's the most regressive tax there is. That's all I'm saying. And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?" I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest. Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS. We had Hamas. Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent. I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman. But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel. So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities. Thank you. If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida. The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing. No, no. The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president. And just thirdly, he was so nice. But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind. Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts. And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this. Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals. We know this for a fact. This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer. We're up 347,000 jobs. Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare. I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now. America is back in the leadership business. How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about? But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others. You can't do that to the party. So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians. So yeah, someone who makes more money... Can we stop? It got stolen from them. You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism. That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president. And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views. Marco Rubio, why don't you resign? And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary. No. And what distributes goods better? They don't want them made here. A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others. You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria. You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans. And, thank you everybody. Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long. Your prosecute criminals. Here's the thing. You bet they do. If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit. Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China. Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that. don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us. And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight. Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here. You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us. It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again. You opposed him then. You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record. You're right. That is why there is massive despair all over this country. Secretary of state for four years. They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law. Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression. So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value. It goes in the right direction. You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair. Carl Icon today as you know endorsed. And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted. So when somebody like Donald Trump and others... Yes. I mean, Chris will know about that. If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question. Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way. Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster. And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition. Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners. Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business. She was naturalized. So, also, we can stimulate the economy. And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees. Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president. Mossadegh back in 1953. Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond? I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind. I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill. They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life. And, I'll do that with the country. But we allowed people to keep health care. There's a big question mark on your head. You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government. The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China. She sees her health insurance going up. If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership. That's 13,000 miles. Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board. And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. OK? We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do. It's driving up stock prices. That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America. You know why? I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed. In the past he has called him weak. And loose money is one of the major problems. I think if it doesn't... This is not entitlement, it's not welfare. Absolutely. They have infrastructure. It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. No, absolutely not. We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it. Professional politician that can't be trusted. In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses. And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold. I'll say this. I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free. We have to stand with them. I get to respond, right? And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together. And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern? You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. We feel like we're being left behind and left out. Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this. Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods. You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president. The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media. Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them. There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration. What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true. That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel." There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages... I think that would have been right, as well. You do. The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things. Maybe you haven't. But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve. Thank you. We have to shut down their internet capability. It's not only a problem here. We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in. This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake. If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent. It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k). And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world. If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest. The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again. When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth. So we have to go after this both abroad and at home. -- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record. I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this. You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation. They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel. Progressives don't believe that. And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look. You know, I am by my nature impatient. I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money. And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans. I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990. In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right. I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth. Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend. In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals. They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China. So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform -- It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders. We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare. There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award... He does great. I didn't have an involvement with them. And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about. I was mentioned in the question. Madam Secretary, that is a low blow. No, it's true. Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have. At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago. We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform. Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money? I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy. My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations. My name was mentioned. But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do. But look... We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack. Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria. But the president leads in this regard. ... of $50 billion... No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that. He is not the only one. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. There is no money in the Social Security account. I want to talk to the folks at home. If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field. He undermines it. This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning. America's at a crossroads. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it. I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years. This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid. I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society. I'll talk to them. And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that. Why didn't they call? What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about. 2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation. They're a scam. What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up. America was worth the wait. And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much... It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter. Think about it. They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe. Neil, my name was mentioned here. Thank you. But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions. If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party. Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail. And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers? Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening. I said temporarily. We need to be focusing on what fixes this country. We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally. And that's just not acceptable. There is a better way to provide health care. And we're going to eliminate the death tax. No one here is under FBI investigation. He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey. It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid. I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it. And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay? He has called him a disappointment. So, we have a lot of work to do. China and Russia have never been on our side of the table. I agree with them. So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like. So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky. We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis. Let me tell you how that question... We got rid of Gadhafi. 13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them. I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs. Let me just say this. And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions. And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual. You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics. We're going to get more revenue. Have been ever since I was in the Senate. They cause dishonesty. It will be a long day. About Medicare? I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side. Our best days are in front of us. And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio. Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened. But then his poll numbers tanked. And for good cause. And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years. He's wrong. The student loan problem has been created by government. That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle. But you know what? If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy. What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American? This is not some small scale group. I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today. I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around. ... tariffs that come against us. Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something. At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist. But let me say one more thing. We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad. And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters. Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes. This is one of the great tragedies in our country today. It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks. It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben. As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq. We need to create jobs. Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next. And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth. You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it. I will not do that. We're running surpluses. But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed. And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz." And the fact is it was wrong. And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers. It never happens. And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956. Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran. That's what we need. I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget. You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor. They stole it. Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers. We need to have stronger families. You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after? I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here. I have a debt to America I'll never repay. One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan. It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government. You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people. We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute. But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio. You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman. We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were. And loose money is one of the major problems. We're running. We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office. I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary. And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation. No. You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow. OK. If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep? And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law. Here is the one thing I'm not going to do. As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine. (LAUGHTER) And he got nasty. I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida. Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem. And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day. We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies. Excuse me, John. I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported. ... they don't like the Wall Street Journal. The worker's out of a job. ...10% flat rate... Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it. We honest to god are here to get this country back on track. You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion." We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us. And that's what we have to contrast. Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body. They can't even make a deal. Thank you for that question. But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police. We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves. That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this. Two quick responses. So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility. But let's not kid ourselves. And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem. No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you. It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row. It's not responsible. But guess who pushed for that regulation? I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished. I'm totally open to a tariff. I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division. But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target. ... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues. Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan. Now, who are the people who are hurt by that? You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful. You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year? When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced. We sent our parks and wildlife wardens. You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time. But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate. I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government. I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent. It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that. Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements. Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee. The number of women -- Illegal. I have fully endorsed those. I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride. Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product. That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society. As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon. Well I want to comment on this. I have studied that issue in great detail. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country. How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence. Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that. Can I tell you what? John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income. And I want to just suggest to you. I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel. It was a big insurance company, AIG. If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country. It never happens. And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have. The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before. I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had. I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act. A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running. About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns. It's extraordinarily wrong. The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. ... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women. Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns. And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes. However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them. Everybody knows that. Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better. He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax. And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages. I'm a fighter. We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country. Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before. And, PBS, thank you. I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies. We were wrong. Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check. I hope you will make a decision soon on this. And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations. Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. We're reducing taxes to 15 percent. I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same. One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran. I'm just saying. That's wrong. Helping business make profits. And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place. Here's the bottom line. Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs. And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that. I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States. We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again. We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy. Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement. If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. I've had my issues with Donald Trump. Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. No, it should be repealed. I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us. ... Just for the record. is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C. And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass. I'm happy to have him tonight... Well, thank you very much. Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C. What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now. We can't do it. Many businessmen want to endorse me. I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program. You looking at me? Someone's going to be collecting this tax. She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video. Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman. And, we come out here, and we do our thing. I think we should do both. She sees her cost of electricity going up. They didn't save enough money for us to go to school. He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected. Why weren't they vigilant? If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission. And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it. See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk. They will -- some will follow. We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others. So what if children are going hungry? But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics. So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe. I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation. Do we have answer for that? We need sound money. Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem. Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents. I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why. I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made. But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector. But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well. What we know is we're living longer. We have to find out what's going on. I was a governor during the 9/11 attack. The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence. Does he stand up for law enforcement? First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK? ... his answer -- you name it. The world has changed. We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico. It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control. His first election and his re-election. So we need 1,000. Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years. And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign. What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people. I was recruited to H.P. And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China. Thanks for coming back to me, Maria. Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done. Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group. I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes. And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton. Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground. I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core. The Syrians should stay in Syria. I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people. We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world. But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit. A lot of people have jumped in here. So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world. Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death? They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana. I know this, I certainly am. Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company. I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington. What else we can do is that we should believe in science. The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions? We have no borders. They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace. Thank you. Carly Fiorina. It is broke, it is not working. If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit. The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago... So we have a disagreement on this. If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country. Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there. And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack. I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth. We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders. ... and I'll tell you why. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together. I have no idea. That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws. We called in, we said, that's it. You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist. But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba. I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money. Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made. Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. Over time, we're going to become energy independent. Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing. People have worked their entire lives. And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could. I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders. Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars. Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there. That is not right. The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling. We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely. I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that. Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood. We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring. We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed. I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state. ... who got us out of that... Unintended consequences. Maria... Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today? There was nothing to this birther issue. But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad. What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable. And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America. But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything. And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama. I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies -- You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science? That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans. You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players. I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007. And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans. Yes, I'm going to do away with that. I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally. (LAUGHTER) But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media. And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade. But, here is the truth. You did. Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads. I would prevent them lobbying Congress. But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory. You know, I have two sons. And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise. Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check. We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails. And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know? We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America. John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here. I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time. It needs to be repealed and replaced. There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns. We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall. He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects. We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters. And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back. If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone. The deployments are too high for the military personnel. I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful. Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign. Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform. There are other racial discrepancies. We put in place mandatory work fair (ph). And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused. He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field. That is our government today. There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans. I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people. Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based. You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president... The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C. People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game... Because I've done it. ... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever. So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on. You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there. Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet. That's my view. They're sick of politics as usual. I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley. It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country. If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. Wait a minute, who in their 16th month? That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day. And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education. No vision at all. They're a feeding frenzy for sick people. You know, you look at women working. I agree with my colleagues. Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world. And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York. Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street? No, you did. Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts. It is. Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league. When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK? We cannot afford four more years of on the job training. You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me. And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about. So I hope you'll reconsider. President Obama and I are friends. I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran. I would prevent them lobbying Congress. I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage. Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is. These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag. OK, good. There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb. The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations. In addition to that... I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible). But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category. The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department. And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father. Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now. I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington. This isn't the governments money. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. That's fine. They haven't done that. That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement. This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back. So we need new leadership -- yes. We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease. We called Ben, he was with me 100%. Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system? Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard. I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is. Median wages have stagnated. Yes, I thought about running four years ago. How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families. ...Chris... We hear actually a lot of good intentions. It's a problem all over the world. And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it. And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future. When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government. Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus? You're simply not. Check it out. And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already. We're going to end up in the same place. And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed. It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax. I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government. This stuff is fantasy. You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed. ...before I go. Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary. It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country. Why don't you wait in line? But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something. Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent. We bailed them out. And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend. ... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services. It's not the evil rich people. That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us. We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Our vets are being treated horribly. Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math. That's why I ask for your support for president. Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert. That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there. You get the Congress. We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force. I think that's a mistake. ... The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process. I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. You know that. Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party? I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage. So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country. In all due respect... Well, I don't know. Health savings accounts are something that we introduced. But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of. Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this. He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy. Maria, let me clear something up here. It's not fear and terror, it's reality. Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning. I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect. And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here... Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change. Good luck making something out of this mess." We're running. But here's the real key. And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill. I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support. My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it." Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program. Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling. Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word. They said they'd shrink and balance the budget. Let me tell you how that question... But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. What you need to do is free up interest rates. What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results. Socialist and government dependent. And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police. As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator. And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK? Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals... Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger. I was the architect. My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country. I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years. I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund. It would not necessitate us raising any taxes. You're talking about $2.7 trillion. Let me just -- let me respond. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed." As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings. ... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election. And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you. In fact, that's part of the problem. I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families. And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country. They were wrong. Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general. They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back. People are upset about it. ... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care. So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism. Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them." The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax. Here's my second problem. He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing. I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue. We have to do this in unison with the Arab world. This election has to be about reversing all of that damage. We don't need to raise taxes to get this done. They're never going to let it happen. We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century. I'd sign that executive order. Liberty thrives when government is small. As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall. And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now. That is not what America should be about. The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist? And you're not serious about destroying ISIL. We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense. And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it. And we need to do that throughout the country. It is why we have to simplify. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse. But on this point, if I may add something on this point. I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing. But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it. Right there, right next to the plant. Well, thank you very much. We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me. And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold. He is undermining our standing in the world. Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue. When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the... I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place. That's what I'm working towards. That is what I could do for the country. He was such a nice guy. I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions. ...Thank you. ...Rand is exactly right. On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Judgment matters as well. I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck. We don't win. A lot has happened in nine months. You really can't. OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media. And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year. Now it is their time to help the middle class. I recommended that the president go forward. This is extraordinary. I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. We're one of the fastest growing states in the country. Thank you. I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law. And our economy was growing like crazy. You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap. My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country. I will do that. Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life. We have to provide financial support to them. And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for. And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation. Divide that out. If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women. They go to Yale. Right and left are spending us into oblivion. Now we're having smaller families. I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run. We have a country of laws. Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country. And that's what I intend to do. So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage. I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan. I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best. ...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS. What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power. There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do. That will never happen when I am president of the United States. But I would add this. The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this. This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration. If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must. You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break. They're going to come in legally. I can govern by bringing people together. There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win. If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more? And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right. It's the same thing that I did in Ohio. So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game. We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent. He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's. How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives? He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system. Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal. So you know what? It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us. ... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be. So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy. She sees her cost of electricity going up. We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes. And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people. The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies. I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity. Since I've been mentioned, can I respond? You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country. According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation. Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton. Check it out. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle. And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed. That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important. I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind. We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack. And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right. I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs. You count on it. I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it. And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security. But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting. Our rights come from God. You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions. There are lids on people's aspirations. That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values. And why? I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women. I'm a free trader. You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America. I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed. If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border. Maria, I'd just like to say... We would still have racism holding people back. Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world. He has gone to China. I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL. And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us. We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left. We lose with ISIS. You once had a pension. He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter. They're a mile away from here. It's harder to talk to your enemies. And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it. We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from. And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know. You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine. But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me. You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion. You know, I won two record elections. You find me... I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times. Nobody can deny them. I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward. There is no money, it's a stack of paper. They go to Harvard. Or that we're just going to be great? You know what he said to me? You don't know it, they tax us. Hey look, he never had a chance. Now Maria, listen. It's called the value added tax. We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government? He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials. I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night. I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did. Both served. That's fine. Neil, my name was mentioned as well. It was the AFL-CIO. I'll check for you. We saw it in the blimp. And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world. I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage. It's Hillary Clinton. Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified. Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them. That could be the great Trojan Horse. Our next president... Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity. It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. We have to stop the money flow. But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change. We now have a 73,000-page tax code. Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country. If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. They cite Obamacare. Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House. When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief. This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military. Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border. And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness. No, that's -- you're wrong. Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women. According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL. Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me. But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families. Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism. And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them. Let people play, who cares? We're borrowing a million dollars a minute. The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason. The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to. We can do a wall. But we have a serious problem. And we will be strong again. Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white. And I used it to pay off my loans. Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event. First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor. And one more point, one more point. Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said. We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system. You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us. I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these... I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security. I've seen plenty of other people follow up? And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs. And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could. We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously? She voted for it. Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger. They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words. ... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe. John Kasich, will you insult two people over here? We will arm and train the Kurds. I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program. If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it. We're a country of laws, Bill. And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president. It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all. Well, I want to know, did you win? It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all. You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over. ... an agreement with the... They say, " well, we don't really have control." You've got to give people hope. We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. How are we going to do this? But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home. And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements. And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed. No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role. ... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority. With all the candidates, why me? It's not working. We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come. After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers. And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share. It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent. It will be a way of life. Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute. Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists. Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity. I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials. You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns? Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China. That is who I'm fighting for. Number two, this isn't me saying it. We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford. I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship. We didn't spend any. And I would not support those. But I guess I'm supposed to come out great. In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care. But that's not an accurate description of the plan. Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here. But, you know what we're not telling them? The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other. John, could I follow up on this? And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities. A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help. You get, like, three days where you have to show up? You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you. We can't do this unilaterally. As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back." He has got -- that is why he is on the end. Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work. Ben Carson, can you do math? Yes, I might feel more comfortable. Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. It's not only offensive; it's dangerous. It was. They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph). I hope Congress says no to this deal. The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria. Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. The fact is, there is a big overhang. It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today. So we need to get on a different mindset. I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship. I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill. You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements. I've done it. You just don't make promises like this. Bill, I want to say one more thing about... And we are not England. Look, we have to stop with political correctness. Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register. Now, we're going to blame the people. And what we want to do is to control this. And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that. Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians. A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good. Where are you gonna clean it up? Thank you. Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases... What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars. And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them. It's not supposed to happen that way. SuperPacs are a disaster. And you know what? Wall Street is doing great. You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans." I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore. We pay federal taxes. I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause. At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until. And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world. I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion... No, it's your record. They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime. We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together. But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing. What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security? I'm a free trader. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay. Yes. I said no. And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people. Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that. For both of them you have to gradually raise the age. I want to take care of women. Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing. Let me just -- just say this. But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C. I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America. And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight. No. If I could just respond. We're going to cut Social Security to help you. It works very, very well. Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years. Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder. ... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home. You had two one hundred... We are at 90 percent coverage. I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act. It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better. The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it. I will put a price tag. So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth. This isn't free money. And you know what? We have to get back into looking at what's causing it. You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics. Let the states do this. This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia. We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family. It is Iran that's the expansionist power. They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world. And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys. But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change? After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression. In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years. The answer is no. And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people. There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. Very good people are making very bad decisions right now. Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood. What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state. Number one, we have to create better paying jobs. It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum. She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video. And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country. Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away. When I was 22, my dad died. We have made it easier to do that, not harder. I will tell you that. Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed. ...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average. Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington. Right. They don't like that. Let me give you one quick example. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy. Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.? I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us. They're tough, they're strong, they're great people. If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it. One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing. But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out. Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means. ... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States. And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture." And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests. I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn. ... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that? People aren't dumb. We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. It takes away discretion from judges. But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived. We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems. You know why three? That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it. I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush. Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot. In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough. They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work. I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there. And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community. Actually a close friend. What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect... There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year. And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot. It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide. For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together. And we need to very, very concerned about that. We have a lot of work to do. And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government. Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted. You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending. I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him. There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people. The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin. It's easier to talk to your friends. And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission. Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights. We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. This was a question on entitlements. Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership? We need to make sure that we keep the country safe. President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote. Thank you. I will stand firm. It is not a suggestion. That never works. We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws. It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home... I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups. Let me be clear. Well, a couple of things. Appreciate it. Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that. The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity. Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military. She was a great CEO. Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that? Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home. We cannot be the world's policeman. And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women. But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS. The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates. How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care? Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor. I think you're -- We need to arm the Kurds the directly. ...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick? That's exactly what we saw. That is beyond unspeakable. Not the change we need at a time we need it. I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it. And, the only way -- no... Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it. And so Senator Graham is right about this. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now. I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers. And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came. Came out great. So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable. Number -- and that is important for you to know. I said temporarily. We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different. That sounds like a long time ago. But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense. Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? It has to be dealt with. Well, I did. It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government. It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American. The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda. And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now. I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country. That's the difference. I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps. When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS. Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them. You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss. You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers. But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran. We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it. The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average. You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes. Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time. Judy, one area very briefly... Credibility counts. You're right. It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive. What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people. And believe me, Assad is not worth it. So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open. You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great. What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns. I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America. It's kind of basic. We had Boko Haram. I'm going to get a response to that, Neil. I have. No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech. Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves. We actually did it. The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?" You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up. It's the New York Times, they are always wrong. We also want to dominate this from a commercial side. You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money. to save a company. And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids. If that's a blind trust, I don't know. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid. We hear a lot of good plans. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it. And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job. I believe we are on the path to doing that. But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America. Hillary Clinton cannot be president. I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society. The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged. That's a dictatorship. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned. I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race. If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again. And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage. I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation. I just want to remind you, people paid their money. And there should be some regulation. We're against your policies. We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. They don't like NBC, but I like the poll. Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will. This is a bad deal. And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else. But we can give people better health care. We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes... Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country. Total propaganda. I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face. Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. When people ask me, whose fault is it? ...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality. ... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John? That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into. Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life. We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on. No accomplishment. No. Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths. Of course not. Bernie Sanders has already said it. Republicans and Democrats alike believe this. Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem. But, let me tell you who not to blame. And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha. We could do a whole show on that. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do. And we can't be the stupid country any more. Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same. Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation. Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government. That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it. And he got nasty. When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it. It was the week she got exposed as a liar. And women have been disadvantaged ever since. And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity. Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem. But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary. We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom. You can't do nothing. I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society. They cause dishonesty. We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous. Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here. Neil, I was mentioned too. 92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women. Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. I actually have a plan. The government has tried it their way. They are not perfect. Their family is waiting for them. The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal... I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law. And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria. I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning. We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds. Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours. That's not true. I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first. A lot of interesting issues have come together. They built the great wall of China. It's poor people and middle class. I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem. Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again. When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs. We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS. So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide. I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done. And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load. You want to see a war on women? We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back. Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election. $19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created. It's not fair trade. Yeah, they are unhinged. You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it. Or would you rather take less later on? Our military is a disaster. They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us. Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists. And I will go back to Washington with my plan. It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds. I'm too agreeable, easy going. The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government? I never said that. Obama broke every rule of negotiation. On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls. But I know who the pessimist is. And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American. We're going to cut costs. So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships. And you can't do that to the party. And, that's with zero percent interest rates. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country. Senator Sanders voted against it at that time. They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future. Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions. Folks, we've got to wake up. In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question. If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well. So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended. It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs. Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C. That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on. Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government." Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid. It isn't law-abiding gun owners. Why didn't they call the police? I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead. Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible). Well, this goes to the question you were just asking. But if you look at working men and women. Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse. They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances. We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education. I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win. And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way. That's not right. You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that. If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited. Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive. QUICK: Governor, thank you. Thank you. The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world. It's time for real substance and real experience. Make our streets safe again. ... And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall. You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us. Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil. So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there. Mr. President, we're not against you. I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that." If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation. And so that was his explanation. It continues with regulatory reform. Not supposed to happen that way. Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth. That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in. But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work. You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money. I was not that candidate. But I want to go further. In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process. Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed. You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not... They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that. And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case. And I could say, oh, I'm not angry. And they don't buy their guns from a gun store. We're not doing it. The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety. That's what he talked about, the great threat of China. And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. The answer is simple. And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history. In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said. But, we can't rest. And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea. I would put it in a blind trust. And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record. Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems. Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies. He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government. In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment. We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it. I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit. We are not France. I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future. They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society. He was on the board. Wait for what? But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense. ...in the world for people... Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with. Well, you know what I'm worried about? ... We haven't. Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall. I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on. And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system. We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out. It isn't there anymore, Mike. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it. I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany. We both want to get more revenue in. We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation. It's one of the biggest problems our country has. Well, the deal was done. I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again. Senator Cruz is precisely right. If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P. All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. Let me just close it out this way. You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it. Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee. And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. And not just green cards. China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again. Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year. I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k). I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president. Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare. We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row. Every election we talk about this. Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax. You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them. Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax. Two points. Creativity. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges. I do. Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose. And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security. We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill. We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria. And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training. And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people. Yeah. I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow. And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision. The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special. Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed. And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren. In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them. Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again. When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would. And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues. And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe. Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America. I was a child of Ronald Reagan. I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage. How about Obamacare, a certified job killer? There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker. And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years. That's what they're doing. This is the same old stuff since I left. First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers. (LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what. This would be devastating for the economy. They are the ones who should respond to any questions. That's what I think we need to do. slot. It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known. Do you remember that, everybody? It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together. Nobody -- I could stand up here all night. And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country. I will be that new leader. I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests. That's right, three pages. If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other. So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash. I like Marco Rubio. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty. It's good to be with you. And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression. I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade. I want to be in -- I want America to be the best... Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare. They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades. And let me be clear. What you need to do is free up interest rates. And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head. The Oregon study showed this. Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be. Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need. How great is that? I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically. My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King. I think the American people are look for real leadership. I hope you'll reconsider. Growth is the answer. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth. I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid. I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot. In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment. I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment. It's not constitutional. What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy. I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this. Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage. Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do. How about this? I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way. And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference. And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best. His family certainly believes that. The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible). My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did. Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody. You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere. Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful. You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders. And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you. Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it. Super PACs are a disaster. Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy. Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse. White people? So I'm going to keep making that case. That's what he is. In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance. We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest. It is a false choice. Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive. And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation. They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors. And here's what the economic issue is. ..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?" Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama. That will be my mission as president. The guns don't pull the trigger. And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. You just want to... It should be what are your substantive positions... We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years. We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country. But we're not gambling. Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here. I had to borrow money to go to school. ... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you. It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent. If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928. Community banks are going out of business. So I have nothing at all critical of him. Not keeping the government open. But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security. Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled. Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country. ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about? They're absolutely false. You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America. I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way. They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers. This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will. Not -- not on that, no. It was the week that she got exposed as a liar... MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor. This country is running out of time. That's right. Can you have Medicare or Social Security? Well, if the law would change, yeah. Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years. You have to lead. And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us. The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem. We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced... Why? And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency. This president is undermining our military. And, folks, we will. A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts. Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years. They know. ... that he tried to take credit for four years later. But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family? We don't need that. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media. We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers. They like General Motors, so they give them a pass. And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done. The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations. So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States. With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference. Okay. I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did. Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably. Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat. I changed it in New Jersey. And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started. We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message. We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment. And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all. A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation. Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job. And I was proud to stand with him and support it. I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill. I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery. Somebody says "I'm a fighter." Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed. He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate. These attack ads are going to be part of life. Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done. He consistently underestimates it but I do not. The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity. But if you look at working men and women. We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this. In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government. And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve. OK? We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit. If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president. There's no way he launches 11 attack -- We just want to be the rich." And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president. Those are two leaders that I admire very much. So I'm doing great. For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do. I will run on my record all day long. You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it. She was right. Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans. ...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it. But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away. We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally. And the reason -- and the reason... s entrenched problems head-on. I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down. But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here. It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems. We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here. We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity. Now, on to your substantive question. It was the week that she got exposed as a liar... If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut. She sees her health insurance going up. So many companies are going to leave our country. A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay. And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation. I got the briefings. You are working at McDonald's? I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama. Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977. But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company. OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation. You get together. Look, the -- the deal is already done. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better. Give Bernie Sanders credit. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. Look, the Second Amendment is not an option. So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program. And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much. We need to get realistic about this. Well, I've learned the rules on this. We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views. I would change them. And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that. And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country. I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us. They get them on the black market. ... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue. They can have it anyway you want. You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas. But she did say there was anger. And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this. They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others. I've laid out... If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck. When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less. ...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all. It is time to believe in America again. 23 million files in the hands of the Chinese? I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid. These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist. The most mistreated people. We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens. China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. You can't do it with empty promised. But I'm going to tell you the truth. Say again? Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income. That comes out to $12,500 for each one. We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans. They do it to us, we don't it. We have not provided them. Here is where we are with public education. OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China. So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed. I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took. Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough. Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement. And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that. What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes. I was not at all. We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years. And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight. Well, it's interesting. We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason. We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone. And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street. What's crony capitalism? I have got deep concerns about the Fed. And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart. I think the times are different now. But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support. This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken. Or somebody else. We need to know who our neighbors are. But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER) And I have many great Muslim friends. But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it. Just want to get that out there, just saying. They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done. So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief. People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country. The time to act is now. Look, here is the reality, folks. The big Internet companies. And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day." But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports. But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well. I am a 2nd amendment person. Gronkowski is still going strong. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life. Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in. I'm looking out for the American worker. We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. I never filed for bankruptcy. But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs. And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs. If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job. And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare. My state is doing great across the board. CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example. We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism." And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now. This is a great nation. Eleven points, to be exact. That's not the role of the government. We will make America great again. It begins with tax reform. You can't deal in China without tariffs. I lead the opposition against it. Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power. We have to do something. I would like to start with a basic. For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days. Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes. Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating. As an outsider, I tackled H.P. Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare. And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding. And... And I want to make this our government. I got that. There are politics in the boardroom as well. No, John. And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States. But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent. We have a country of borders. We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. That is absolutely not right. Yes. That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country. One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year. Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. And not only did I fight them, but I beat them. You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that. And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world. Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff. Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen? And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this. I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up. That's for sure. Instead, the Washington establishment raised both. And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word. And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy. A rich person does not. So you might not. I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't... And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger. And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down. This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks. That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families. You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go. But I think they will see a very good option here. I've used it three times, maybe four times. But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order. Now, he's doing better. Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo. You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation. When I was 21, my mom died. You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality. We need a fighter for this country again. It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing. And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?" This is a remarkable and horrifying fact. And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment. Look, that's who I stand up for. We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids. Right. Wall Street is doing great. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved. We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. We have to be honest about it. People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this. Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business. Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand. You also have to some strategically cutting in several places. John, I'd like to address this? We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work. -- the issue is who is going to get it done. Have you ever disagreed with a president? Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits. We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam. And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse? I'm ready. We have to obey the laws. I am deadly serious about changing this culture. The other issue is mental health. I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016. And yes, I am angry. Let me translate that for you. Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look. Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money." Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake. Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years. I've got a track record. And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator. The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria. It feels different. I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said. And guess what? I'm too trusting. And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion. We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States. They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up. Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get. Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out. And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place. We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart. I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation. I mean, you know... This is a business flat tax. It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on. So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president. No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those -- I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home. How do I know this? Thank you. And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups. We came back from the dead. ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. Yes, they've got to get out of Syria. Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here. That is not what America is supposed to be about. He got lucky with fracking. Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000. I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country. And here's the last piece... Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States. This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish. You lead and you produce results. We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates. But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English. And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary... If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance. And Mr. Trump is very focused... I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said. And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster. I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception. And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. Is there an area for a safety net? African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system. You want to fix Medicare? We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing. What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free." No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees. And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration. They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can. She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements." It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless. I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there. We've got to stop this culture of government dependence. Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this. I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement. Well, I would really appreciate that. There's something going on and it's bad. It was a hard choice. I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation. But the average person takes out about $350,000. And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military. Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues. They do celebrate more dependence on the government. I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us. You know why three? I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing. We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles. And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them. I'm very proud. Here's the thing. I'm happy to answer the question... I'm going to do it for America. Not trustworthy. But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies. You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists. We have Arab allies. And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves. That is absolutely inaccurate. We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class. We'll go to the Congress. When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up. This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation. Manufacturing will flow back into this country. Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children. The people that Washington leaves behind. I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues. So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences. Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it. We both have a lot of small donors. So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America. You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time. He's wrong. Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations. But the final thing I want to say about this is the following. Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars. You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars? We're friends. We're becoming Greece if we don't work together. And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them. China is ripping us on trade. We need sound money. It's peanuts. And you know what? It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country. I'm worried about bankrupting the American people. He's a gifted politician. I want security for this country. They're Muslim. This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys. I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me. Alright. Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733. But also, I can't fake anger. I don't care. There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code. I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it. I have no illusion. I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country. That is not protected religious belief. We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War. I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason. And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border. Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you. I've a bill to fix Social Security. We are lowering taxes on small business. I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country. Got 70 votes in the United States Senate. ... replacing dependency with opportunity. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. I think President Obama has set a great example. And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal... I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight. I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said. They're off to China. This guy is a petulant child. All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country. I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration. Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family. So I'm going to come up with the best way forward. We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching. There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone. We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism. I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country. Let me (inaudible). We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We are mixing apples and oranges. If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away? The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done. And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state. And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton. This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides. This is 2016. Well, that's a real question. I didn't inherit any money. That's not the way the game is supposed to be played. Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money. You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar. Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future. First of all, yes, we've stolen. We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families. My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich. But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it. The Europeans have moved on. This issue is not about that anymore. Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. I'll tell you what else people are concerned about. I never said that. You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law. He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us. In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago. But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits. Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it. I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana. Of course you are right. And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests. We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago. They have to come into this country legally. Listen, I want to just comment. In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it. What should we do? Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all. I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries. I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey. And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.

0.0	0.27	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.12	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.23	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.22	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.12	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.35	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.14	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.19	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.09	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.47	Thank you.
0.0	0.39	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.37	You know, that's so simple.
1.0	0.46	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.23	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.43	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.16	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.30	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.18	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.22	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.23	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.23	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.18	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.18	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.18	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.15	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.25	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.16	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.14	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.31	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.32	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.11	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.18	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.19	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.20	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.45	I can.
0.0	0.20	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.31	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.36	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.22	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.33	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
1.0	0.19	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.14	He has never defended...
0.0	0.19	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.36	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.14	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.36	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.23	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.34	Right.
0.0	0.20	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.11	Thank you.
0.0	0.03	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.14	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.21	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.29	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.13	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.12	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.29	Thank you.
0.0	0.37	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.14	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.21	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.62	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.24	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.55	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.23	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.19	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.10	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.23	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.09	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.18	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.22	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.20	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.54	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.25	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.13	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.31	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.18	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.26	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.20	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.34	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.31	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.33	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.33	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.16	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.33	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.28	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.17	I'm tested.
0.0	0.32	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.33	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
1.0	0.19	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.14	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.13	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.35	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.26	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.63	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.20	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.27	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.44	I like that.
0.0	0.32	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.83	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.32	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.46	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.20	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.15	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.42	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.27	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.43	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.28	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.35	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.13	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.28	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.24	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.49	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.15	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.18	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.24	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.30	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.16	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.25	in particular.
0.0	0.35	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.40	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.29	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.18	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.24	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.32	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.18	Neil...
0.0	0.25	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.32	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.14	...income tax...
0.0	0.42	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.31	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.19	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.09	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.19	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.44	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.36	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.21	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.41	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.55	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.13	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.11	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.30	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.26	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.16	...
0.0	0.44	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.27	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.40	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.36	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.24	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.22	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.38	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.33	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.29	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.47	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.14	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.16	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.19	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.44	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.35	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.32	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.29	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.22	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.30	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.17	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.17	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.51	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.20	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.22	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.44	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.75	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.42	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.32	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.22	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.21	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.12	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.13	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.21	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.16	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.17	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
1.0	0.24	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.26	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.51	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.14	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.03	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.15	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.32	We need a doer, not a talker.
1.0	0.22	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.15	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.13	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.18	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.49	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.34	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.36	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.27	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.16	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.31	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.18	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.49	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.43	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.14	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
1.0	0.11	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.22	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.10	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.27	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.19	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.23	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.17	I suspect you may have.
1.0	0.21	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.66	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.10	Thank you.
0.0	0.23	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.32	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.34	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.32	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
1.0	0.11	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.26	This country is changing.
0.0	0.18	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.33	No.
0.0	0.23	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.45	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.24	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.52	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.11	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.28	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.19	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.26	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.13	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.27	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.22	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.23	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.19	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.15	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.13	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.25	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.63	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.18	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.36	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.20	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.18	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.14	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.27	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.17	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.25	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.21	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.63	On welfare.
0.0	0.22	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.30	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.39	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.21	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.22	That's not right.
0.0	0.29	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.31	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.24	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.70	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.18	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.22	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.44	A brief response.
0.0	0.69	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.32	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.37	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.19	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.25	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.30	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.32	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.11	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.12	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.29	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.15	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.11	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.10	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.43	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.25	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.17	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.27	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.20	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.41	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.10	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.17	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.09	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.35	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.23	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.44	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.23	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.20	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.06	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.26	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.18	And God bless America.
0.0	0.36	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.13	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.35	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.17	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.28	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.08	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.25	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.27	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.44	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.26	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.60	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.25	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.18	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.25	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.17	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.19	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.30	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.32	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.22	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.13	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.13	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
1.0	0.09	It's not theirs anymore.
1.0	0.25	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.22	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.30	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.26	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.19	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.23	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.16	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.14	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.16	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.28	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.44	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.16	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.34	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.22	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.27	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.10	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.34	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.11	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.42	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.18	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.50	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.41	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.51	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
1.0	0.14	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.33	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.63	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.16	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.14	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.24	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.21	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.26	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.39	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.33	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.34	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.25	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
1.0	0.24	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.11	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.34	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
1.0	0.25	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.47	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.19	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.27	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.16	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.10	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.21	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.26	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.10	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.21	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.12	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.23	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.47	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.19	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.38	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.30	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
1.0	0.21	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.22	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.24	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.26	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.26	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.24	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.29	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.11	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.29	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.10	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.19	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.17	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.20	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.53	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.14	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.10	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.25	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.10	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.47	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.64	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.12	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.37	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.61	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.18	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.36	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.18	That is important.
0.0	0.14	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.16	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.19	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.17	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.13	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.20	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.24	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.24	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.31	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.14	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.13	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.19	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.26	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.30	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.14	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.26	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.15	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.45	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.30	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.24	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.43	I know every one.
0.0	0.33	I changed that.
0.0	0.25	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.26	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.26	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.34	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.46	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.27	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.18	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.19	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.25	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.10	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.30	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.22	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.16	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.15	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
1.0	0.36	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.22	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.35	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.22	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.22	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.27	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
1.0	0.27	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.32	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.21	I love this country.
0.0	0.52	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.19	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.26	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.10	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.15	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.11	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.09	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.36	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.23	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.31	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.45	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.50	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.09	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.21	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.34	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.23	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.23	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.63	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.62	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.17	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.56	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.12	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.24	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.36	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.21	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.23	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.74	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.15	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.22	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.20	He just writes out an executive order.
1.0	0.68	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.24	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.16	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.36	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.15	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.12	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
1.0	0.13	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.39	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.20	OK?
0.0	0.22	Big difference.
0.0	0.30	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.26	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.28	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.25	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.25	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.27	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.17	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.28	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.30	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.16	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.27	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.14	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.23	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.18	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.27	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.28	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.21	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.50	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.27	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.44	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.31	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.34	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.51	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.25	What have you got now?
0.0	0.13	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.37	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.54	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.57	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.34	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.20	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.17	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.15	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.61	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.20	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.23	No.
0.0	0.33	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.30	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.24	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.25	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.30	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.14	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.33	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.30	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.22	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.25	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.37	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.18	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.25	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.64	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.21	I would change them.
0.0	0.63	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.19	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.28	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.18	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.18	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.19	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.23	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.12	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.25	I win.
0.0	0.11	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.10	He hit oil.
0.0	0.54	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.33	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.45	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.20	John.
0.0	0.28	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.29	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.14	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.26	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.14	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.19	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.06	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.59	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.22	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.76	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.22	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.11	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.19	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.42	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.32	So...
1.0	0.35	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.30	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.25	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.08	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.28	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.15	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.09	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.27	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.41	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.32	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.16	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.13	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.52	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.27	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.51	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.29	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
1.0	0.20	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.18	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.39	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.32	Right.
0.0	0.25	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.13	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.31	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.45	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.38	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.21	Think about it.
0.0	0.19	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.22	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.22	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.31	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.39	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.21	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.12	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.32	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
1.0	0.30	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.14	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.36	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.50	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.34	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.32	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.10	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.13	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.17	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.25	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.12	He wasn't my senator.
1.0	0.27	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.20	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.19	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.26	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.45	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.41	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.22	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.36	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.62	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.39	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.20	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.50	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.26	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.26	...No, sir...
0.0	0.22	It's driving up stock prices.
1.0	0.30	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.28	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.25	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.51	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.22	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.25	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.20	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.19	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.32	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.10	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.23	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.18	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.42	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.42	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.40	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.30	OK?
0.0	0.23	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.17	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.12	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.20	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
1.0	0.18	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.38	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.31	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.31	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.37	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.21	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.19	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.19	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.21	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.27	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.12	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.20	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.21	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.20	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.37	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.27	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.14	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.15	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.18	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.12	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.16	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.21	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.20	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.26	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.15	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.41	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.59	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.29	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
1.0	0.31	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.39	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.30	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.12	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.19	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.31	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.14	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.19	I promise.
0.0	0.19	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.34	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.11	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.18	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.13	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.08	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.31	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.10	John?
0.0	0.18	Well, sure.
0.0	0.22	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.50	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.27	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.12	They're a scam.
0.0	0.10	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.20	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.20	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.15	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.30	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.32	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
1.0	0.23	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.24	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.21	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.23	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.30	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.21	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.34	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.13	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.40	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.20	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.25	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.41	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.42	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.14	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.29	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.69	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.21	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.22	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.35	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.20	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.35	Why is that?
0.0	0.12	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.20	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.27	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.18	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.22	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.17	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.32	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.08	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.22	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.15	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.20	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.41	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.15	Yes.
0.0	0.21	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.21	I understand.
0.0	0.23	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.21	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.14	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.19	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
1.0	0.24	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.22	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.30	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.32	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.32	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.21	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.26	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.48	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.24	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.40	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.16	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.30	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.29	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.24	You do legislation.
0.0	0.17	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.44	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.29	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.23	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.13	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.44	And here's why.
0.0	0.28	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.27	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.13	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.23	No.
0.0	0.15	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.34	My background is different.
0.0	0.17	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.15	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.36	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.13	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.26	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.46	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.13	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.48	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.30	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.20	...Chris...
0.0	0.27	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.21	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.53	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.16	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.14	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.38	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.39	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.23	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.13	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.31	My point is this.
0.0	0.22	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.09	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.51	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.21	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.19	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.34	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.20	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.14	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.34	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.65	I can't do it.
0.0	0.26	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.10	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.46	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.27	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.37	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.17	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.17	I am against the raids.
1.0	0.36	Very few children.
0.0	0.18	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.56	That's what I said.
0.0	0.30	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.14	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.20	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
1.0	0.20	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.37	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.37	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.23	And you know what?
0.0	0.29	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.42	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.30	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.12	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.30	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.20	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.37	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.40	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.34	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.18	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
1.0	0.18	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.32	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.37	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.17	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.18	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.30	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.15	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.27	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.12	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.13	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.29	Good at email.
0.0	0.16	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.58	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.41	I can do that.
0.0	0.30	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.15	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.31	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.31	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.22	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.21	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.35	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.46	And, we said no.
0.0	0.32	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.34	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.24	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.12	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.30	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.26	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.21	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.14	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.40	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.07	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.36	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.55	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.17	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.30	See?
0.0	0.37	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.50	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.26	And you know what?
0.0	0.18	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.66	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.29	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.10	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.14	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.36	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.30	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.26	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.21	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.15	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.46	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.14	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.17	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.46	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.35	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.14	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.15	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.28	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.17	He is a good man.
0.0	0.13	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.30	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.18	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.44	That will change everything.
0.0	0.55	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.26	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.32	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.40	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.12	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.29	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.12	It's a joke.
0.0	0.23	That's an interesting question.
1.0	0.22	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.21	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.20	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.34	But I was born here.
0.0	0.26	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.10	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.21	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.35	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.30	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.28	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.19	Thank you.
0.0	0.22	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
1.0	0.16	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.23	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.21	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.24	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.19	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.23	You can have him.
0.0	0.25	And so do I.
0.0	0.17	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.27	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.11	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.35	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.18	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.19	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.26	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.28	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.26	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.19	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.44	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.31	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.25	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.17	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.23	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.31	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.29	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.68	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.28	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.26	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.25	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.15	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.34	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.13	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.36	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.20	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.28	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.15	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.39	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.21	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.20	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.12	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.46	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.21	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.23	Becky --
0.0	0.40	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.38	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.35	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.33	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.47	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.34	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.19	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.45	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.65	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.10	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.32	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.40	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.19	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.43	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.34	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.24	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.15	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.16	You don't have to.
0.0	0.41	I totally get that.
0.0	0.21	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.44	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.09	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.44	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.18	That has not been...
0.0	0.38	I never said that.
0.0	0.16	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.11	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.31	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
1.0	0.21	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.05	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.09	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.11	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.24	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.30	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.15	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.04	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.19	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.11	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.20	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.23	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.34	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.82	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.34	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.33	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.17	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.17	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.31	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.31	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.36	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.39	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.10	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.12	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.19	I would just say that...
0.0	0.35	That is...
0.0	0.13	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
1.0	0.29	They were wrong.
0.0	0.31	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.31	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.39	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.24	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.26	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.32	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.18	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.15	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.36	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.31	It's their money.
0.0	0.28	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.25	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.25	Right.
0.0	0.21	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.48	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.18	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.21	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.14	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.24	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.10	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.36	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.17	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.19	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.17	... he's really doing some bad...
1.0	0.44	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.40	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.15	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.36	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.16	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.33	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.19	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.14	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.12	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.34	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.09	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.39	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
1.0	0.22	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.58	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.29	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.14	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.22	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.43	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.13	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.14	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.37	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.21	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.21	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.25	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.22	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.22	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.45	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.13	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.13	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.34	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.46	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.17	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.10	Not bad.
0.0	0.30	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.22	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.14	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.64	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.26	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.19	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.53	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.22	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.26	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.29	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.27	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.25	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.31	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.26	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.38	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.22	Thank you.
0.0	0.15	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.63	Again...
0.0	0.15	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.21	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.09	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.30	(inaudible).
0.0	0.32	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.09	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.31	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.24	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.45	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.30	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.13	And you know what?
0.0	0.28	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.29	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.39	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.11	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.21	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.26	We do.
0.0	0.38	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.20	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
1.0	0.17	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.12	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.26	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.15	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.37	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.26	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.45	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.34	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.31	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.17	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.21	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.21	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.15	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.35	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.51	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.40	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.26	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.22	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.18	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.38	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.32	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.26	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.15	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.11	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.17	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.26	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.24	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.35	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.30	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.51	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.24	No.
0.0	0.23	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.16	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.19	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.17	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.19	I don't like that.
0.0	0.25	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.16	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.26	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.32	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
1.0	0.38	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.13	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.09	That's my bill.
0.0	0.18	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.27	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.18	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.33	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.83	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.24	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.27	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.47	I didn't.
0.0	0.18	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.59	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.09	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.29	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.27	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.39	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.18	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.32	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.38	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.23	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.22	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.25	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.40	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.22	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
1.0	0.28	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.33	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.27	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.17	I want security.
0.0	0.15	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.14	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.16	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.23	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.13	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.18	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.14	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.08	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.25	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.09	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.13	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.30	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.25	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
1.0	0.27	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.22	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.49	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.22	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.28	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.13	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.31	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.26	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.20	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.28	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.27	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.20	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.33	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.56	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.08	The problem is we never get it done.
1.0	0.44	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.18	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.44	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.21	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.39	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.32	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.57	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.33	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.21	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.37	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.16	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.22	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.38	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.18	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.19	I like it.
0.0	0.55	You target the bad guys.
1.0	0.19	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.25	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.10	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.15	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.39	...John...
0.0	0.23	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.24	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.20	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.22	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.33	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.23	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.10	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.33	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.29	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.19	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.31	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.31	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.17	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.18	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.45	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.19	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.17	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.17	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.18	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.48	No -- no...
0.0	0.15	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.26	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.36	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.16	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.42	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.69	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.25	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.07	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.44	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.17	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.15	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.20	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.42	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.33	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.20	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.31	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.16	I think he would have been right.
1.0	0.07	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.15	I never said that.
0.0	0.24	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.35	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.15	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.19	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.27	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.16	But...
0.0	0.38	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.17	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.21	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.24	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.53	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.21	Ever.
0.0	0.22	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.13	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.19	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.28	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.22	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.27	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.38	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.09	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.37	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.22	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.22	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.59	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.22	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.32	...
0.0	0.32	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.25	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
1.0	0.47	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.22	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.45	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.50	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.32	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.15	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.22	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.47	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.24	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.21	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.15	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.23	This will end.
0.0	0.14	Think about that.
0.0	0.17	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.14	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.56	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.33	It's true.
0.0	0.26	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.06	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.19	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.23	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.49	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.21	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.31	You're welcome.
0.0	0.18	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.25	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.35	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.14	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.30	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.68	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.22	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.18	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.28	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.08	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.34	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.36	You know, let me say something at the outset.
1.0	0.37	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.36	Dynamically.
0.0	0.23	They're very concerned about it.
1.0	0.19	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.36	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.23	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.28	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.11	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.11	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.51	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.33	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.23	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.19	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.40	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.15	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.35	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.25	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.16	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.21	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.40	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.17	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.40	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.52	Thank you.
0.0	0.16	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.36	You know why?
0.0	0.34	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.22	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.29	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.21	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.15	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.26	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.28	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.15	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.09	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.29	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.36	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.19	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.27	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.33	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.10	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.16	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.23	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.23	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.71	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.19	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.20	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.19	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.49	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.58	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.31	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.17	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.18	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.22	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.16	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.46	I think he is right.
0.0	0.30	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.15	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.23	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.12	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.16	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.15	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.16	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
1.0	0.21	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.56	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.32	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.21	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
1.0	0.23	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.16	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.23	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.31	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.38	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.11	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.25	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.19	I love China.
0.0	0.29	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.39	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.27	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.36	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.14	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.09	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.28	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.21	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.18	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.16	No their not.
0.0	0.29	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.39	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.41	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.25	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.28	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.27	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.21	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.19	That's good.
0.0	0.19	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.17	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.21	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.16	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
1.0	0.15	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.21	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.30	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.15	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.51	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.13	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.25	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.06	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.36	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.23	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.52	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.22	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.19	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.42	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.19	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.20	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.31	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.24	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.35	We need security.
0.0	0.43	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.69	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.32	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.24	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.28	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.35	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.23	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.24	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.28	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.30	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.25	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.16	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.52	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.20	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.31	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.61	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.33	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.18	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.23	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.14	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.16	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.35	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.28	OK.
0.0	0.25	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.20	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.28	Yeah.
0.0	0.18	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.15	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.44	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.34	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.62	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.18	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.28	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.68	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
1.0	0.28	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.20	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.15	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.15	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.29	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.15	It goes away.
0.0	0.17	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.15	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.25	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.27	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.20	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.19	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.16	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.44	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.21	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.19	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.14	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.33	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.73	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.48	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.26	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.19	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.14	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.28	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.29	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.21	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.11	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
1.0	0.22	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.16	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.11	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.35	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.30	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.18	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.22	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.12	Thank you.
0.0	0.77	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.17	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.26	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.39	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.18	No, no.
0.0	0.20	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.21	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.37	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.34	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
1.0	0.51	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.13	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.44	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.23	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.63	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.26	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.35	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.10	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.40	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.14	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.24	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.26	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.16	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.23	Can we stop?
1.0	0.38	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.22	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.16	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.23	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.54	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.63	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.34	No.
0.0	0.33	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.29	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.60	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
1.0	0.21	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.16	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.27	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.19	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.18	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.41	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.32	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.20	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.34	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.53	You bet they do.
0.0	0.19	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.28	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.22	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.19	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.36	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.20	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.14	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.17	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.27	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.40	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.07	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.22	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.18	You're right.
0.0	0.29	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.36	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.16	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.16	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.21	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.42	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.21	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.19	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.38	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.26	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.14	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.13	Yes.
0.0	0.54	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.32	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.09	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.24	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.23	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.10	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.33	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.29	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.32	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.16	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.31	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
1.0	0.21	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.16	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.28	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.38	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.19	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.24	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.08	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.22	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.22	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.14	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.24	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.14	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.23	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.23	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.53	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.38	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.48	OK?
0.0	0.49	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.40	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.20	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.17	You know why?
0.0	0.78	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
1.0	0.21	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.48	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.24	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.19	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.39	Absolutely.
0.0	0.12	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.19	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.11	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.31	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.41	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.19	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.34	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.31	I'll say this.
0.0	0.33	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.31	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.22	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.17	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
1.0	0.33	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.28	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.40	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
1.0	0.23	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.27	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.32	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.43	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.11	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.20	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.28	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.31	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.42	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.36	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.51	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.26	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.15	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.67	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.21	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.25	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.20	You do.
0.0	0.23	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.29	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.49	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.31	Thank you.
0.0	0.66	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.31	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.15	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.22	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.31	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.22	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.16	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.18	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.26	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.37	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.15	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.34	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.19	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.16	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.14	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.26	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.26	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.29	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.26	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.11	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.16	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.12	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.24	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.28	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.21	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.08	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.29	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.18	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.14	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.35	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.17	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.25	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.29	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.19	He does great.
1.0	0.27	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.13	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.23	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.19	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.16	No, it's true.
0.0	0.21	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.28	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.34	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.17	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.09	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.34	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.30	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.40	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.13	But look...
0.0	0.23	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.16	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.29	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.21	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.33	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.22	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.33	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.12	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.40	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.10	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.11	He undermines it.
0.0	0.33	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.28	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.16	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.21	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.36	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.23	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.12	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.32	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.46	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.19	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.35	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.53	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.32	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.20	They're a scam.
0.0	0.37	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.19	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.37	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.34	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.11	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.08	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.24	Think about it.
0.0	0.24	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.19	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.15	Thank you.
0.0	0.42	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.09	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.23	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.15	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.21	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.51	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.15	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.29	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.17	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.13	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.44	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.20	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.17	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.25	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.29	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.14	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.39	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.26	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.56	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
1.0	0.27	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.19	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.19	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.32	I agree with them.
0.0	0.34	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.21	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.12	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.34	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.23	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.26	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.41	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.22	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.27	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.13	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.20	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.31	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.21	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.20	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.31	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.29	About Medicare?
0.0	0.28	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.19	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.34	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.40	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.36	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.60	And for good cause.
1.0	0.16	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.24	He's wrong.
0.0	0.21	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.17	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.22	But you know what?
0.0	0.15	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.41	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.10	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.31	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.13	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.55	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.24	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.45	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.09	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.37	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.16	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.23	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.22	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.19	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.40	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.15	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.43	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.41	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.29	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.20	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.35	I will not do that.
0.0	0.21	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.13	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
1.0	0.26	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.48	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.21	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.28	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.13	It never happens.
0.0	0.25	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
1.0	0.20	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.08	That's what we need.
0.0	0.47	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.24	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
1.0	0.22	They stole it.
0.0	0.19	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.13	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.28	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.31	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.17	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.35	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.37	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.19	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.16	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.19	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.35	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.34	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.35	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.33	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.14	We're running.
0.0	0.47	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.25	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.25	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.26	No.
0.0	0.44	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.22	OK.
0.0	0.26	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.69	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.18	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.24	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.10	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.29	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.19	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.21	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.08	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.11	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.70	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.10	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.14	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.33	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.32	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.32	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.07	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.34	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.16	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.30	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.32	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.31	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.16	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.39	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.24	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.50	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.32	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.71	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.17	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.23	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.28	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.62	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.17	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.54	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.21	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.30	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.14	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.18	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.32	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.20	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.46	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.10	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.22	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.18	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.46	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.05	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.71	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.21	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.15	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.24	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.31	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.28	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.27	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.15	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.26	The number of women --
0.0	0.14	Illegal.
0.0	0.36	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.38	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.40	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.21	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.25	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.20	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.22	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.32	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.28	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.10	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.29	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.19	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.19	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.30	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.13	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.16	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.37	It never happens.
0.0	0.22	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.17	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.18	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.16	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.20	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.29	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.18	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.19	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.27	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.23	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.28	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.07	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.16	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.15	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.13	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.20	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.18	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.11	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.27	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.16	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.27	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.25	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.08	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.17	We were wrong.
0.0	0.41	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.14	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.21	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.14	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.28	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.35	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.42	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.26	I'm just saying.
1.0	0.22	That's wrong.
0.0	0.23	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.51	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.29	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.31	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.39	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.42	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.45	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.55	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.16	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.56	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.15	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.49	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.21	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.23	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.21	...
0.0	0.22	Just for the record.
0.0	0.24	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.18	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.27	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.13	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.48	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.14	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.24	We can't do it.
0.0	0.16	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.23	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.28	You looking at me?
0.0	0.09	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.14	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.21	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.16	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.26	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.28	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.19	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.14	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.23	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.19	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.13	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.23	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.13	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.32	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.17	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.30	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.20	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.45	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.18	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.46	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.25	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.22	We need sound money.
0.0	0.34	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.12	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.55	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.59	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.29	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.31	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.31	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.26	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.19	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.61	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.31	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.11	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.21	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.35	The world has changed.
0.0	0.08	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.17	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.46	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.27	So we need 1,000.
1.0	0.20	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.11	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.50	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.13	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.26	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.22	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
1.0	0.10	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.26	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.38	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.12	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.21	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.22	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.36	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.11	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.30	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.14	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.31	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.17	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.45	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.23	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.26	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.30	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.15	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.35	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.18	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.25	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.44	We have no borders.
0.0	0.29	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.20	Thank you.
0.0	0.28	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.23	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.30	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
1.0	0.23	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.20	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.18	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.68	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.15	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.18	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.27	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.19	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.75	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.20	I have no idea.
0.0	0.23	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.20	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.13	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.28	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.30	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.17	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.27	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.27	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.33	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.27	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.20	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.40	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.37	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.22	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.28	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.35	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.20	That is not right.
0.0	0.24	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.27	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.17	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.42	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.34	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.37	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.22	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.16	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.20	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.12	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.24	Maria...
0.0	0.27	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.66	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.21	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.19	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.37	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.20	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
1.0	0.24	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.21	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.18	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.13	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.17	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.45	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.24	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.12	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.22	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.37	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.38	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.25	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.25	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.27	You did.
0.0	0.11	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.41	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.18	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.29	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.12	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.15	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.32	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.19	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.30	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
1.0	0.31	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.29	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.16	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.33	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.18	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.39	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.27	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.61	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.22	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.25	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.28	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.23	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.26	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.40	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.16	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.14	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.29	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.44	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.39	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.39	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.23	That is our government today.
0.0	0.08	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.50	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.39	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.15	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.19	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.26	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.14	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.51	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.16	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.16	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.43	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.20	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.18	That's my view.
0.0	0.19	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.29	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.12	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.59	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
1.0	0.23	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.21	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.34	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.18	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.26	No vision at all.
0.0	0.24	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.17	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.17	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.29	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.33	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.24	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.25	No, you did.
0.0	0.24	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.17	It is.
0.0	0.26	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.30	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.49	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.22	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.34	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.22	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.21	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.18	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.09	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.16	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.30	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.35	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.36	OK, good.
0.0	0.16	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.31	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.30	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.18	In addition to that...
0.0	0.22	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.31	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.07	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.24	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.36	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.09	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.19	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.14	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.24	That's fine.
0.0	0.19	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.13	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.15	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.36	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.14	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.46	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.07	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.24	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.20	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.50	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
1.0	0.27	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.27	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.27	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.04	...Chris...
0.0	0.22	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.27	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.20	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
1.0	0.18	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.18	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.21	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.22	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.32	You're simply not.
0.0	0.19	Check it out.
0.0	0.46	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.36	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.45	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.20	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.58	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.12	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.46	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.11	...before I go.
0.0	0.34	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.30	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.25	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.30	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.36	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.26	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.15	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.29	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.18	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.33	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.42	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.30	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.22	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.62	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.12	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.38	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.24	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.59	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.28	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.22	...
1.0	0.18	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.10	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.18	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.20	You know that.
0.0	0.21	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.23	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.22	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.18	In all due respect...
0.0	0.11	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.20	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.20	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.13	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
1.0	0.42	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.21	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.12	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.20	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.29	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.14	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.14	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.23	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.16	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.13	We're running.
0.0	0.21	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.38	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.31	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.19	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.44	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.69	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.29	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.05	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.35	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.17	Let me tell you how that question...
1.0	0.18	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.22	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.59	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.17	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.32	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.30	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.17	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.32	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.15	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.47	I was the architect.
0.0	0.17	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.35	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.38	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.26	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.27	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.19	Let me just -- let me respond.
1.0	0.63	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.44	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
1.0	0.14	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.25	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.26	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.28	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.28	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.15	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.17	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.29	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.44	They were wrong.
0.0	0.21	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
1.0	0.18	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.26	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.49	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.32	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.18	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.36	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.37	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.26	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.45	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.34	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.29	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.15	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.12	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.28	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.16	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.26	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.38	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.08	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.20	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.11	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.15	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.18	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.23	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.20	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.29	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.18	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.33	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.16	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.23	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
1.0	0.24	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.24	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.62	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.55	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.26	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.19	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.19	He is undermining our standing in the world.
1.0	0.08	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
1.0	0.17	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.37	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.22	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.33	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.16	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.25	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.20	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.28	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.22	...Thank you.
0.0	0.29	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.12	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.30	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.23	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.18	We don't win.
0.0	0.36	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.20	You really can't.
0.0	0.12	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.32	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.32	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.27	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.34	This is extraordinary.
1.0	0.16	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.22	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.21	Thank you.
0.0	0.13	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.78	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.36	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.21	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.17	I will do that.
0.0	0.27	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.24	We have to provide financial support to them.
1.0	0.21	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.45	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.40	Divide that out.
0.0	0.24	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.17	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.23	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.15	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.20	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.32	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.26	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.16	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.64	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.28	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.33	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.39	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.20	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.23	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.28	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.22	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.17	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.12	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.30	But I would add this.
0.0	0.60	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.26	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.09	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.37	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.20	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.24	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.26	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.18	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.11	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.14	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.22	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.22	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.23	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.34	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.33	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.51	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.25	So you know what?
0.0	0.56	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.19	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.23	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.19	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.23	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.19	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.24	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.75	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.29	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.37	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.26	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.18	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.15	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.30	Check it out.
0.0	0.30	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.36	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.22	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
1.0	0.17	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.41	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.38	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.16	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.23	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.13	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.32	You count on it.
0.0	0.67	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.58	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.23	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.15	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.49	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.31	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.43	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.36	And why?
0.0	0.33	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.34	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.14	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.49	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.27	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.33	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.16	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.21	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.10	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.18	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.35	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.18	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.38	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.33	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.33	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.28	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.15	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.09	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.30	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.55	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.26	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.23	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.10	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.31	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.27	You find me...
0.0	0.19	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.16	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.14	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.21	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.28	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.36	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.49	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.48	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.27	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.54	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.58	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.09	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.37	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.21	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
1.0	0.27	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.20	Both served.
0.0	0.08	That's fine.
0.0	0.13	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.10	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.09	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.43	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.27	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.26	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.28	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.16	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.17	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.58	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.30	Our next president...
0.0	0.24	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.82	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.07	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.41	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.61	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.25	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.15	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.44	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
1.0	0.62	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.19	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.23	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.52	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.39	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.29	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.11	No, that's -- you're wrong.
1.0	0.14	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.30	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.22	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.56	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.17	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.27	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.22	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.17	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.42	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.23	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.20	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.17	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.23	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.27	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.25	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.17	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
1.0	0.18	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.20	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.23	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.24	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.20	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.20	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.22	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.49	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.32	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.23	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.37	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.11	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.25	She voted for it.
0.0	0.16	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.38	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.28	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.12	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.23	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.13	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.18	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.17	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.12	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.12	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.27	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.22	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.16	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.14	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.69	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.22	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.12	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.28	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.13	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.27	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.15	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.24	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.08	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.33	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.17	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.29	It's not working.
0.0	0.15	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.11	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.55	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
1.0	0.15	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.13	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.25	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.28	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.40	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.35	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.40	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.25	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.25	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.10	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.30	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.29	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.18	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.11	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.19	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.16	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.26	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.15	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.21	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.13	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.30	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.21	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.47	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.28	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.24	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.45	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.64	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.29	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.31	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.26	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.22	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.13	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.39	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.13	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.16	It was.
0.0	0.15	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.21	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.28	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.14	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.26	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.34	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.23	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.12	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.80	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
1.0	0.57	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.21	I've done it.
0.0	0.21	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.19	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.21	And we are not England.
0.0	0.21	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.35	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.27	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.21	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.37	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.43	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
1.0	0.18	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.28	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.30	Thank you.
0.0	0.15	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.39	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.44	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.61	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.54	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.19	And you know what?
0.0	0.14	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.12	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.47	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.17	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.22	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.21	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.18	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.16	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.44	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.12	No, it's your record.
1.0	0.25	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.11	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.12	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.28	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.13	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.17	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.19	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.33	Yes.
0.0	0.23	I said no.
0.0	0.31	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.45	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.29	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.22	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.29	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.34	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.19	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.13	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.18	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.14	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.24	No.
0.0	0.10	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.32	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.19	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.17	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.20	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.13	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.15	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.22	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.22	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.40	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.30	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.28	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.73	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.41	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.12	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.18	And you know what?
0.0	0.23	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.40	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.54	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.18	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.10	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.19	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.54	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.15	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.14	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.16	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.21	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.35	The answer is no.
0.0	0.27	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.24	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.38	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.10	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.18	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.21	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.24	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.26	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.32	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.16	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.23	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.59	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.19	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.49	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.35	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.21	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.12	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.33	Right.
0.0	0.19	They don't like that.
0.0	0.28	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.18	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.23	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.24	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.10	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.11	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.56	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
1.0	0.14	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.10	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
1.0	0.51	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.35	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.28	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.20	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
1.0	0.26	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.22	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.13	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.27	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.22	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.17	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
1.0	0.25	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.21	You know why three?
0.0	0.22	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.18	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.32	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.08	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.19	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.38	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.22	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.26	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.20	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.22	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.28	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.34	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.43	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.71	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.25	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.30	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.31	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.59	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.26	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
1.0	0.37	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.15	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.24	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.20	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.19	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.17	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.15	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.12	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.22	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.32	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.09	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.15	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.30	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.12	Thank you.
0.0	0.26	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.38	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.27	That never works.
0.0	0.30	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.20	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.32	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.25	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.21	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.20	Appreciate it.
1.0	0.27	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.19	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.21	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.18	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.22	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.18	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.36	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.26	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.37	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.21	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.28	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.33	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.24	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.18	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.23	I think you're --
0.0	0.63	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.46	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.27	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.34	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.20	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.33	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.22	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.37	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.26	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.23	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.12	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.45	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.17	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.20	Came out great.
0.0	0.29	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.08	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.62	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.20	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.49	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.27	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.22	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.12	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.20	Well, I did.
0.0	0.08	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.24	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.29	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.29	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.21	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.30	That's the difference.
0.0	0.22	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.21	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.30	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.14	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.26	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.16	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.21	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.07	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
1.0	0.18	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.19	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.31	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
1.0	0.18	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.68	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.18	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.19	You're right.
0.0	0.50	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.21	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.09	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.18	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.24	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.25	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.46	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.16	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.13	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.27	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.37	I have.
0.0	0.12	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.19	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.23	We actually did it.
0.0	0.14	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.27	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.18	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.76	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.30	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.26	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.26	to save a company.
0.0	0.20	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.25	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.28	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.17	We hear a lot of good plans.
1.0	0.39	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.44	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.18	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.24	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.53	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.31	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.17	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.24	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.28	That's a dictatorship.
1.0	0.28	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.17	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.23	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.11	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.53	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.25	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.24	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.11	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.12	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.21	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.26	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.31	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.09	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.84	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.21	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.27	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.61	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.15	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.31	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.36	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.22	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.11	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.23	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.12	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.16	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.39	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.41	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.24	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.11	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.29	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.31	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.25	No.
0.0	0.15	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.41	Of course not.
0.0	0.39	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.38	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.14	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.23	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.28	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.36	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.31	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.35	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
1.0	0.18	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.15	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.48	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.29	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.26	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.35	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.34	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.32	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.17	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.70	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.12	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.19	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.20	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.33	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.16	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.09	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.67	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.06	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.18	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.40	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.44	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.74	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.20	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.14	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.58	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.14	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.24	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.16	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.32	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.33	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.09	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.09	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.33	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.16	That's not true.
0.0	0.30	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.16	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.26	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.11	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.44	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.46	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.27	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.18	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.22	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.13	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.23	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.23	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.07	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.22	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.19	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.38	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.14	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.25	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.30	Yeah, they are unhinged.
1.0	0.30	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.20	Or would you rather take less later on?
1.0	0.58	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.17	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.57	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.51	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.16	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.23	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.19	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.26	I never said that.
0.0	0.57	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.36	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.22	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.12	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.24	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.74	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.28	And you can't do that to the party.
1.0	0.23	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.16	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.26	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.18	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.21	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.15	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.27	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.09	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.25	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.11	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.51	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.29	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
1.0	0.27	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.20	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
1.0	0.14	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.37	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.25	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.34	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.35	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.26	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.13	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.19	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.16	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.34	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.09	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.25	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.40	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.43	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.24	That's not right.
0.0	0.15	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.11	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.64	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.38	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.58	Thank you.
0.0	0.43	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.38	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.20	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.78	...
0.0	0.33	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.31	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.29	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.20	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.23	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.56	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.61	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.23	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.28	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.20	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.24	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.28	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.09	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.15	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.19	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.62	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.12	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.13	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.23	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.30	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.42	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.16	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.24	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.28	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.15	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.26	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.25	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.16	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.20	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.36	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.12	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
1.0	0.20	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.43	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.25	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.28	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.34	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.11	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.18	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.24	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.06	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.23	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.26	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.15	We are not France.
0.0	0.18	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.16	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.26	He was on the board.
0.0	0.14	Wait for what?
0.0	0.32	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.37	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.21	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.16	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.53	...
0.0	0.12	We haven't.
0.0	0.19	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.13	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.37	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.14	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
1.0	0.18	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.28	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.12	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.27	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.36	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.08	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.23	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.22	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.25	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.11	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.36	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.26	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.27	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.36	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.10	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.16	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.24	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.57	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.16	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.26	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.25	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.45	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.19	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.25	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.16	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.32	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.29	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.07	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.18	Two points.
0.0	0.18	Creativity.
1.0	0.39	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.13	I do.
0.0	0.28	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.35	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.35	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.16	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.18	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.14	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.68	Yeah.
0.0	0.61	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.29	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.23	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.20	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.14	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.10	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.21	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.17	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.29	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.25	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.41	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.24	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.23	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.13	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.23	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.42	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.16	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.26	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.36	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.07	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.27	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.32	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.23	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.15	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.18	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.23	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.34	slot.
0.0	0.21	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.73	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.29	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.12	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.21	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.28	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.47	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.38	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.16	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.21	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.27	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.38	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.09	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.13	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.17	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.17	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.21	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.23	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.20	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.23	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.17	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.24	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.26	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
1.0	0.21	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.25	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.29	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.29	How great is that?
0.0	0.19	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.35	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.21	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.26	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.32	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.17	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.22	Growth is the answer.
1.0	0.11	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.13	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.24	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.71	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.19	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.49	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.45	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.17	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.26	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.21	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.62	How about this?
0.0	0.42	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.37	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.28	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.56	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.17	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.44	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.26	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.27	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.40	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.15	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.36	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.68	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.26	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.34	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.46	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.18	White people?
0.0	0.42	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.22	That's what he is.
0.0	0.26	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.19	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.53	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.42	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.20	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.22	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.26	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.09	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.20	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.64	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.24	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.18	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.24	You just want to...
0.0	0.22	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.19	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.39	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.14	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.47	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.16	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.28	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.12	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.29	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.12	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.18	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.16	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.23	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.41	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.17	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.19	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.48	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.20	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.26	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.25	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.13	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.17	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.22	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.33	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.51	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.20	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.14	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.17	That's right.
0.0	0.22	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.31	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.17	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.38	You have to lead.
0.0	0.28	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.20	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.63	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.51	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.10	Why?
0.0	0.12	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
1.0	0.18	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.43	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.17	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.15	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.46	They know.
0.0	0.24	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.45	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.27	We don't need that.
0.0	0.27	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.15	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.20	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.19	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.21	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.18	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.17	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.34	Okay.
0.0	0.22	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.35	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
1.0	0.07	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.54	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.12	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.17	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.20	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.25	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.37	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.23	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.16	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.14	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.52	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.52	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.14	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.21	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.31	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.15	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.16	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.16	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.24	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.32	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.29	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.10	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.25	OK?
0.0	0.17	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.38	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.23	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.19	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.53	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.30	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.24	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.11	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.16	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.26	I will run on my record all day long.
1.0	0.14	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.19	She was right.
0.0	0.13	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.18	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.12	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.12	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.10	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.29	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.14	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.31	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.19	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.10	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.19	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.20	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.18	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.22	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.12	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.55	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.22	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.22	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.22	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.20	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.29	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.17	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.51	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.35	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.23	You get together.
0.0	0.76	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.34	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.36	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.37	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.47	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.17	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.24	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.19	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.20	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.21	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.11	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.32	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.28	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.34	I would change them.
0.0	0.19	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.13	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.10	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.30	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.56	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.28	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.23	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.72	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.19	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.10	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.15	I've laid out...
0.0	0.17	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.18	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.32	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.20	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.32	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.84	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.16	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.40	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.20	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.53	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.32	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.28	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.19	Say again?
0.0	0.49	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.11	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.27	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.25	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.47	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.18	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.29	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.28	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.22	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.44	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.18	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.29	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
1.0	0.33	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.13	I was not at all.
0.0	0.12	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.42	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.27	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.35	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.11	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.07	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.46	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.15	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.26	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.25	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.37	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.32	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.28	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.22	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.15	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.29	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.20	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.22	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.45	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.13	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.19	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.41	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.19	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.27	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.31	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.19	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.20	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.19	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.35	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.74	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.29	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.11	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.12	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.15	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.26	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
1.0	0.21	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.21	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.20	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.19	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
1.0	0.42	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.18	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.22	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.35	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.22	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.14	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.23	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.35	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.17	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.22	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.50	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.28	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.33	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.28	We have to do something.
0.0	0.21	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.26	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.14	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.15	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.52	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.19	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.38	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.16	And...
0.0	0.31	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.17	I got that.
0.0	0.31	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.10	No, John.
0.0	0.12	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
1.0	0.27	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.17	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.07	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.18	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.06	Yes.
0.0	0.14	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.26	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.25	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.37	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.28	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
1.0	0.28	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.11	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.24	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.34	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.61	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.25	That's for sure.
0.0	0.56	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.16	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.23	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.22	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.12	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.18	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.46	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.16	So you might not.
0.0	0.16	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.23	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.13	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.25	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.24	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.35	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.23	But I think they will see a very good option here.
1.0	0.44	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.19	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.19	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.43	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.52	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.19	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.23	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.34	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.18	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.33	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.16	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.24	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.31	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.14	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.12	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.18	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.20	Right.
0.0	0.46	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.36	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.33	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.19	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.20	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.29	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.19	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.20	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.19	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.15	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.11	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.11	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.12	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.17	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.19	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.19	I'm ready.
0.0	0.25	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.50	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.20	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.33	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.24	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.80	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.20	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.21	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.17	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.26	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.21	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.14	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.18	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.37	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.12	It feels different.
0.0	0.11	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.19	And guess what?
0.0	0.28	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.10	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.69	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
1.0	0.33	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.25	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.20	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.23	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.31	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.16	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.28	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.13	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.16	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.17	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.26	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.18	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.22	How do I know this?
0.0	0.21	Thank you.
0.0	0.37	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.23	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.64	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.20	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.18	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.24	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.15	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.22	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.47	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.24	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.18	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.35	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.25	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.62	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.15	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.31	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.36	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.40	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.43	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.25	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.39	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.20	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.17	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.19	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.58	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.18	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.10	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.19	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.38	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.57	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
1.0	0.16	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.23	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.67	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.25	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.23	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.25	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.39	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.45	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.40	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.27	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.24	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.14	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.44	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.22	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.11	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.34	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.18	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.36	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.10	You know why three?
0.0	0.20	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.50	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.34	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.27	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.13	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.27	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.14	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.27	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.18	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.39	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.46	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.15	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.45	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.17	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.21	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.27	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.19	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.27	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.32	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.31	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.13	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.44	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.21	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.24	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.67	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.38	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.18	He's wrong.
