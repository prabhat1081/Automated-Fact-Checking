0.0	0.408920291837	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.178350310825	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.

1.0	0.446600592586	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.319633428719	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.534865198892	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.267744845323	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.370129214216	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.

0.0	0.141741321737	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.0473406253945	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.200390410978	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.410992959734	Do I take the product?

0.0	0.636097830524	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.397216168358	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.46894482874	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.

0.0	0.246806811353	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.746251419934	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.

0.0	0.152579497888	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.389794604904	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.509977616886	The planes are older than the pilots.

0.0	0.280885384621	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.277123499658	Play by the rules.

0.0	0.518502532647	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.430845453212	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.449679195414	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.762517925161	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.5	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.516101162514	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.24842348998	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.190656002298	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.288188694957	Here's -- here's our plan.

0.0	0.45408638523	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
1.0	0.907638777057	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.327846169884	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.412772115216	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.

0.0	0.419920340581	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.511563496499	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.644505504729	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.372405766896	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.322690421372	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.749323732057	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.

1.0	0.392076740309	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.645377635116	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.178520156807	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.310923282558	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.1242850805	...eliminates the business...

0.0	0.315281695873	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.476657847364	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.

0.0	0.446044748	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.151895926369	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.0666220424799	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.

0.0	0.33611422538	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.387094548526	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.1443409502	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.464439621142	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.397004608588	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.391293143164	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.427144825578	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.198132437225	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.420183067765	That is important.
0.0	0.185333175269	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.57198528137	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.794773591717	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.38987143011	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.391959337777	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.466521102328	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.

0.0	0.183957479304	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.42705756352	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.162736993518	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.467777201996	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.280473523557	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.617412660348	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.490578911828	It was Countrywide Mortgage.

0.0	0.395770649352	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.105935701552	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...

0.0	0.581442944515	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.

0.0	0.294516427197	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.259706292508	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.209710756728	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.

0.0	0.707035708829	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.5851601287	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.380020913205	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.265929339962	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.729039314419	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.263869672216	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.668679590183	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.606937982673	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.149188330888	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.545811217814	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.508974241992	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.124089959546	...No, sir...

0.0	0.577925352555	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.0786114729677	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.23211404873	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.0228143510849	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.118310385594	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.309338750756	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.44407398309	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.353384101767	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.562312799503	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.353940163801	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.21874835897	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.5	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.512267724443	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.953845573664	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.348990608902	OK?
0.0	0.491703632694	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.360525851569	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.5	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.595940880755	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.

0.0	0.414049518083	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.820971793705	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.239534261379	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.335330307065	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.448119074943	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.677814217175	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.545585343529	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.358827759814	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.379187754532	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.63782409685	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.159042777585	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.438040962638	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.241743443291	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.331320351868	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.445044493804	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.209884497657	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.406863626075	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.793597324656	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.798277400714	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.338253195116	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.258376464903	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.190876215447	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.0731414272253	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.442118381234	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.55217620531	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.674066061916	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.241342679172	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
1.0	0.549813472055	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.200147990772	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.384254429481	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.407850682326	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.489285350524	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.37694094801	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.313062951077	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.400887308547	I promise.
0.0	0.38100184183	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.405043725291	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.369428872496	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.179020738697	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.399017788571	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.338059312932	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.539065144038	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.360941040375	John?
0.0	0.262668272888	Well, sure.
0.0	0.348884867232	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.192064830804	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.229165100012	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.44465416276	They're a scam.
0.0	0.181025901755	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.521934786009	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.881205709297	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.409114067271	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.168201389628	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.335516488792	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
1.0	0.659291569833	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.593617408403	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.230500667321	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.545972268343	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.296262314462	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.488353448287	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.385063846238	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.455732836136	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.367413351119	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.1614306187	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.0901740850995	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.419444903344	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.53755347172	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.39203015214	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.284777677614	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.267901808847	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.46350829413	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.560254489013	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.327832693111	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.359272311179	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.294326545288	Why is that?
0.0	0.19440944567	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.172117308615	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.412190244812	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.361911556155	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.316571914136	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.701581090334	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.208466886061	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.644732506703	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.568829187158	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.361708864242	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.258131410106	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.110176727671	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.348990608902	Yes.
0.0	0.664253022526	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.283624643234	I understand.
0.0	0.727027334884	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.383327723622	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.176070036761	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.380723883839	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
1.0	0.659400670857	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.619845758879	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.279460825863	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.488101454957	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.149194115574	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.34735244854	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.483223644454	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.392821361794	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.131267637587	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.597057588715	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.515986852215	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.411800209943	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.54743754943	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.477546155416	You do legislation.
0.0	0.199647458593	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.369683016511	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.381099408773	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.453838888971	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.261823171033	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.162629551601	And here's why.
0.0	0.0243366765641	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.450885697256	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.291529474592	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.318574655824	No.
0.0	0.366397709092	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.429566607731	My background is different.
0.0	0.343033200057	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.14847039085	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.447750903213	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.297084548364	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.574323307714	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.446738519152	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.337462241919	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.385152431957	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.407780071423	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.212715678573	...Chris...
0.0	0.513788511034	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.370045994576	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.5	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.739781257071	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.203417842187	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.46435529586	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.319158762405	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.651270107028	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.657365447904	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.384217821244	My point is this.
0.0	0.388003974822	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.661819155392	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.24529118421	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.440127067201	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.364157541056	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.467193241219	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.422460499055	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.258750635946	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.0972637915093	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.338859419881	I can't do it.
0.0	0.601294758272	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.36094451502	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.274832914962	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.731229129655	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.5	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.569241172934	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.234779909859	I am against the raids.
1.0	0.556042710576	Very few children.
0.0	0.616405689683	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.485741371939	That's what I said.
0.0	0.336366389999	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.544551357472	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.276878104325	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
1.0	0.54922414748	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.457537823222	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.344240785033	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.352648421309	And you know what?
0.0	0.318972670334	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.211867977449	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.429493984564	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.490840349498	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.263150298038	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.52660140812	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.620450710029	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.312879725299	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.136129631759	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.307135364713	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
1.0	0.911879529735	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.38105969673	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.418187493547	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.193700085103	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.493667910355	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.393155646822	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.376644121452	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.470575429449	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.433773828365	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.400440624321	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.38587239015	Good at email.
0.0	0.68011891643	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.737180672391	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.307199871099	I can do that.
0.0	0.299334488196	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.449935722799	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.461276052948	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.490331949341	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.1206522135	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.48465945272	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.276709034377	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.295400352371	And, we said no.
0.0	0.480938906568	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.306569953344	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.295648983993	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.56328875849	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.639613688046	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.136653952401	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.291550738523	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.621274845825	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.417130619829	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.439980624759	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.377169319679	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.200035412236	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.528076935226	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.315699584964	See?
0.0	0.619269221464	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.225312022882	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.352648421309	And you know what?
0.0	0.418518878825	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.348311570337	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.67201376121	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.34782380371	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.286711482062	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.482910676705	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.390819170448	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.591745102185	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.375130061587	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.507708624011	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.547067142784	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.804763865095	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.634059916465	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.415550574458	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.409698054565	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.516687593173	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.567075081238	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.469810394756	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.5	He is a good man.
0.0	0.241447154449	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.429609787684	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.290326441029	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.344281831398	That will change everything.
0.0	0.490736376011	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.335802814091	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.367436999461	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.178105750302	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.0459864305882	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.685385563354	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.214357731318	It's a joke.
0.0	0.402909639874	That's an interesting question.
1.0	0.738728865926	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.312308203691	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.296389829779	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.453539653989	But I was born here.
0.0	0.648088302525	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.142697079083	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.134686716737	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.374380718763	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.322189326657	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.663818890559	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.235831984454	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
1.0	0.673727009366	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.209338602707	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.257297925095	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.337845049862	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.88681619658	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.345846836025	You can have him.
0.0	0.228210096943	And so do I.
0.0	0.267837189988	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.369164124454	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.650390324142	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.884513524211	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...

0.0	0.417628539777	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.319739395564	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.330760113462	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.40162149428	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.412261075833	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.

0.0	0.607111816452	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.483169910537	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.272340501264	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.403796964254	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.395316883858	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.44169475033	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.56001151335	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.433372755627	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.430035858375	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.27485480392	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.422069224241	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.27339116166	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.560634002843	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.560833353431	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.302626860522	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.237142993254	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.575846671105	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.254995102034	Becky --
0.0	0.431514165425	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.341107310209	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.

0.0	0.382048694772	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.549446614088	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.470617530758	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.646432464368	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.671643339144	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.346580129955	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.934795611731	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.517826198336	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.353651375013	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.162317231063	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.370164422135	You don't have to.
0.0	0.283746588901	I totally get that.
0.0	0.123486812019	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.

0.0	0.478580454184	You can't just ban all Muslims.

0.0	0.332844962182	That has not been...
0.0	0.477092635793	I never said that.
0.0	0.217783538671	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.446359602012	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.219575484162	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
1.0	0.695472829253	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.474907670729	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.341401089546	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.831681243761	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.507423910682	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.619975453814	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.705512097162	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.740053385982	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.546682213207	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.558846707321	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.571816264142	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.388975026581	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.436514938041	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.59707816508	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.806468182719	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.735024240014	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.525502184747	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.711367591346	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.434072286676	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.37077154202	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.309090713059	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.423934665162	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.059753057468	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.5	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.22953097088	I would just say that...
0.0	0.25774273239	That is...
0.0	0.61201901473	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
1.0	0.610600639073	They were wrong.
0.0	0.592973127335	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.29964849623	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.352993278362	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.398946791459	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.1035631776	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.284483468612	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.396102642573	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.220451920383	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.341668853433	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.5	It's their money.
0.0	0.297592200239	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.115623478029	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.348982224829	Right.
0.0	0.416556189615	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.393468785825	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.219430697288	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.709684650166	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.875661488385	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.343262540534	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.0540285860958	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.281297441128	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.545774103229	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.596515650134	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.19340804145	... he's really doing some bad...
1.0	0.284607539293	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.564071432944	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.555559753927	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.44484877881	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.286762097299	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.201292039966	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.74295458902	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.26866938336	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.494434674628	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.476184966431	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.610007878373	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.430398540943	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
1.0	0.486141889569	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.663593898159	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.572456822743	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.460404115984	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.517884329699	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.39646054775	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.391742106444	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.335949272586	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.352874521217	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.515242283021	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.540649836385	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.794023491783	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.303454040474	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.333154473721	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.354322155303	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.552973338313	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.385624669278	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.509066152196	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.334377241305	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.218589569329	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.34969808728	Not bad.
0.0	0.464213936111	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.389657722103	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.589053735419	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.690839580102	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.180112994128	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.689423673563	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.470324361918	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.0545414535721	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.216919790928	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.4940660149	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.527205730974	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.394858575277	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.293421118184	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.707586259247	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.0348982611345	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.543854596569	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.244702490561	Again...
0.0	0.525520536854	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.461528257494	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.302398423567	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.349000796955	(inaudible).
0.0	0.590135072162	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.449281340013	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.700676739689	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.0536984887631	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.614140441938	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.519760793946	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.352648421309	And you know what?
0.0	0.4639746918	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.424807111685	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.849984444502	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.10231634845	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.358600458093	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.373356688056	We do.
0.0	0.480158177664	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.232225143725	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
1.0	0.603744267571	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.0454864339458	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.5	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.685628827794	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.578966229918	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.136680057128	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.382091562558	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.463679037502	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.447581282945	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.312286212551	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.556330751731	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.482957565267	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.21795102974	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.292063938603	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.653221025894	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.219500532637	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.447605171406	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.342701877695	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.389774153508	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.369884008716	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.5	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.481816762558	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.683040343487	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.396498728422	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.

0.0	0.240171433338	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.5	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.333614382454	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.

0.0	0.270743956441	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.318574655824	No.
0.0	0.589535339105	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.473756971683	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.312394871698	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.385956839753	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.267823852465	I don't like that.

0.0	0.381099408773	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.62638496527	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.260643256593	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
1.0	0.849599197151	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.159183382044	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.410448146778	That's my bill.
0.0	0.424186086004	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.303395806957	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.470068452587	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.505941319178	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.521949063454	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.847639326414	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.293723637986	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.467924348881	I didn't.

0.0	0.429615489806	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.391351662194	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.238796239384	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.0509893224698	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.342678550682	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.

0.0	0.218843999747	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.25945635603	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.335454736446	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
1.0	0.775419628538	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.

0.0	0.276837007091	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.462191573956	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.

0.0	0.69381734458	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.321073676252	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.12517590088	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.289675765749	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.486865293539	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.368362601312	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
1.0	0.551139822656	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.885704713531	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.176091006941	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.607293042887	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.429766263031	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.133846197682	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?

0.0	0.681760988816	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.210656869847	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.44237205183	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.368996055131	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.0979517736579	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.413391835846	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.463208874483	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.613409306902	The problem is we never get it done.
1.0	0.554593654239	It looked like very few women.

0.0	0.339925579257	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.477679216817	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.45894340111	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.487973597192	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.612114219896	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.525681537885	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.09947647719	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.115868304474	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.351504894953	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?

0.0	0.418070095841	You target the bad guys.
1.0	0.659375610723	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.205609258212	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.423600248207	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.276965412143	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.

0.0	0.823935774813	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.49260626974	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.571111854346	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.539375682594	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.355475101906	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.199306581383	I'm aware of that.

0.0	0.180412874237	No -- no...
0.0	0.820502707776	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.379524668696	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.

0.0	0.546233961243	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.396701174078	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.245535908774	I'm never going to change my tune.

0.0	0.373489853221	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.341312891475	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.348982224829	Ever.
0.0	0.404079366591	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.0976348477041	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.257129474381	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.37583089317	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.399725442747	I voted yes to suspend that.

0.0	0.237714721858	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.248883544188	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.345300899801	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.219957576978	...
0.0	0.319974700132	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.149662026851	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
1.0	0.924478967603	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.232516957339	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.323604513106	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.535157604961	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.485898483456	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.312017720212	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.214736077115	-- the governor's absolutely right.

0.0	0.193566309761	It's true.
0.0	0.438039141631	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.220353200092	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.743768631545	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.375878458097	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.313334444891	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.

0.0	0.328915408916	You're welcome.
0.0	0.317295664827	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.830433776587	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.

0.0	0.509857688266	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.5319979877	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.123094837091	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.400158505094	That's good.

0.0	0.645824008922	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.357869213833	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.349122466189	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.111902236379	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.519198437713	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.441519923707	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.676315393297	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.365934704963	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.250318714124	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.16774038125	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.448781006048	We need security.
0.0	0.246457878353	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.358602833164	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.233466306989	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.456599576977	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.251297862427	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.187247445839	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.48279944806	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.676879765796	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.437788588992	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.334047585098	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.349136123936	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.360494103622	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.58973109136	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.0810006553816	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.400362171465	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.285146418843	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.60858933796	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.625413742056	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.746345869883	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.590330714881	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.179265234328	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.489696063761	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.348990608902	OK.
0.0	0.304903168024	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.406849154214	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.348990608902	Yeah.
0.0	0.260152171612	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.230310573919	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.365424695837	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.561005767221	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.36866793648	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.552234743055	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.436471062182	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.0773255635282	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
1.0	0.766861235748	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.384403281038	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.51051231403	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.293506155605	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.404870518942	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.426017179859	It goes away.
0.0	0.541786567829	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.444120908233	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.404617117531	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.534718233167	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.38913803373	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.402569707265	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.543601182856	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.422199907893	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.349283561648	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.281641647814	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.6977419136	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.290273910226	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.654078839538	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.635190675483	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.623575629691	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.364024746212	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.479207440956	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.334977068153	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.5	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.389881662481	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.462741130555	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
1.0	0.827042461263	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.598088598908	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.481612090092	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.595109871694	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.663760476007	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.189051015515	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.182943228052	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.336000189865	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.690263880435	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.352495686875	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.559647985387	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.273619238383	No, no.
0.0	0.557626320317	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.162235926701	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.586848133267	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.533770174596	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
1.0	0.216945850162	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.545723249751	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.218045038189	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.713827535193	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.275849601403	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.25121072203	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.626436459619	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.537385771034	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.339359701344	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.5	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.378203036444	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.383347789526	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.334881739479	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.306863123636	Can we stop?
1.0	0.321118116675	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.0816292798368	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.436599941844	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.163132509894	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.368796828559	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.647851851262	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.318574655824	No.
0.0	0.317328525143	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.409116496015	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.526008402672	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
1.0	0.696255661703	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.74047757565	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.171160145063	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.214625978723	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.168938271463	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.523403671386	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.556091426697	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.283980331451	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.3614688355	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.338934026684	You bet they do.
0.0	0.421799650789	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.278813713819	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.590122231578	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.447769356743	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.578134064117	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.728991448675	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.480608009066	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.719477591213	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.455918986314	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.292391265518	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.53276837496	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.312283890576	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.396747329076	You're right.
0.0	0.360379032616	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.590981184643	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.0922246499799	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.5	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.177815492183	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.335807132796	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.428118186383	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.813727259827	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.569385857539	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.486590272151	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.210042808403	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.348990608902	Yes.
0.0	0.24174260638	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.431526226391	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.0801955196498	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.354664250934	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.247911145976	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.512749672938	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.0367391089712	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.261922349189	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.417124407573	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.234799792992	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.871391509307	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
1.0	0.633727421289	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.378118072128	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.351181537825	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.540173146242	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.5	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.411277212377	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.248185970126	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.463503221322	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.433227424727	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.75108971678	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.203720851913	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.1368160111	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.627360969228	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.387029150669	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.354584794134	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.152869214276	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.348990608902	OK?
0.0	0.336770770936	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.418720733215	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.5	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.313947038811	You know why?
0.0	0.176712882678	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
1.0	0.589391229083	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.17945484085	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.242759260394	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.54801301466	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.348982224829	Absolutely.
0.0	0.447909136733	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.140352378564	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.315582618817	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.463243317569	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.320991250488	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.521487722252	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.208466886061	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.349638746448	I'll say this.
0.0	0.659114780268	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.402718373835	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.355358038521	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.361881376344	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
1.0	0.736721879793	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.225135625323	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.0999985224483	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
1.0	0.6450670472	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.29112223874	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.435874704608	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.0529675722363	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.352572507103	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.667366048512	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.12002876726	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.385060809765	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.137965322385	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.224363151121	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.188238985931	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.362134821103	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.58838129429	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.437900150075	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.372536174418	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.277219086569	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.373356688056	You do.
0.0	0.392665927328	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.420938753991	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.599458789609	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.286546158911	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.633016275238	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.298535070959	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.390257261446	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.763611143967	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.54154749791	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.715948657012	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.298038013055	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.273225729543	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.948637874576	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.216504945528	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.697827546139	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.251276302038	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.657400852695	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.21089494158	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.338119073973	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.391817829361	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.393815303265	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.147640503384	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.716134502684	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.159042777585	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.342234144278	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.422652504913	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.477864926544	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.581419844685	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.670189728071	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.617831660317	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.670479163491	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.506885074825	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.237079074644	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.478591201282	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.348655467085	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.560097684803	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.376148281342	He does great.
1.0	0.603402350744	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.361817976123	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.614177321969	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.447078881497	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.162056160539	No, it's true.
0.0	0.5	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.614757078427	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.546849046374	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.30070847898	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.306626859231	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.692954599628	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.278169682893	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.359487308156	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.179537226968	But look...
0.0	0.320218367195	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.320229166667	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.35089962237	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.403959517921	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.573837304725	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.596142472511	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.852674429286	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.604383174036	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.412349281568	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.669350149386	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.253315108814	He undermines it.
0.0	0.27046052002	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.254760679351	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.208063138324	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.343389806852	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.674042818864	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.245392796308	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.240747861837	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.198829236845	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.360330576916	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.293300052195	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.41859292776	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.418656774512	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.657149879568	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.455180352825	They're a scam.
0.0	0.180638431919	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.540170357281	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.287645999013	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.344284860843	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.294789260888	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.15319126159	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.336288764837	Think about it.
0.0	0.675639492844	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.291767458781	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.472425992925	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.236259852576	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.701975958123	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.211586753045	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.454372762602	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.494321125074	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.465167655632	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.110957991725	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.374726479607	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.40156325787	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.267981413194	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.490599771276	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.415287070787	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.557488307138	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.545466885225	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.625507342597	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.57416102642	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.606178029801	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.213203954708	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
1.0	0.395678563355	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.3053393866	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.335718130962	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.178600789358	I agree with them.
0.0	0.31518321557	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.544108061025	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.298843295848	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.477352455243	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.390375532427	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.446581591324	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.623840444549	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.377402849676	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.0655684625353	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.26544553514	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.463016856974	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.474794148572	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.612703745885	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.187181232903	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.280148563932	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.347740117397	About Medicare?
0.0	0.867903385777	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.414553271389	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.278709127562	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.835926191618	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.38286284551	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.349657139952	And for good cause.
1.0	0.72842125658	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.422465086981	He's wrong.
0.0	0.693328811928	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.581750685535	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.352648421309	But you know what?
0.0	0.314466019246	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.285685875601	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.561382424379	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.575521718542	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.438429596084	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.143817398021	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.275812486872	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.323531566505	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.329212389452	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.150724140334	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.205970454501	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.514944736517	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.282098905484	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.334915211109	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.434374548281	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.5	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.27683457773	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.348850977285	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.391600002053	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.409381616234	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.372068586094	I will not do that.
0.0	0.567750386577	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.475262631538	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
1.0	0.765712836638	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.646203935257	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.475497843565	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.0344964021156	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.426017179859	It never happens.
0.0	0.3717365097	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
1.0	0.587334554915	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.405955927648	That's what we need.
0.0	0.394129631226	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.333031039305	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
1.0	0.5	They stole it.
0.0	0.485271958973	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.294286921687	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.357658718595	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.544232912864	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.248646485773	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.740978142571	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.653383147011	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.300819608487	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.342862320578	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.464754255678	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.319635230804	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.7640268894	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.246015532546	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.290624170603	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.19483242721	We're running.
0.0	0.818450893547	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.443081133451	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.431362554165	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.318574655824	No.
0.0	0.440255936149	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.348990608902	OK.
0.0	0.252321506854	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.347674764345	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.665514917744	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.389562217702	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.349068313392	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.739742550988	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.553206917091	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.76749616645	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.201923600314	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.132323616597	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.341680149835	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.381616176161	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.330463133626	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.354027563635	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.44506363616	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.628276883093	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.477098638835	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.580663011082	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.187391276704	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.492833621236	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.357656129524	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.628343999899	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.472705448357	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.379968517819	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.515969323476	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.244267085291	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.705596941404	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.428963075243	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.234834935407	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.34300466427	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.455719413102	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.540933118317	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.848719121952	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.464781286478	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.5	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.309673129076	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.5	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.350019506105	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.340071782551	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.136828547088	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.256215620502	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.472341321247	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.621837136852	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.629132950204	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.308319069419	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.567714453965	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.43490684336	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.62010524039	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.618541759881	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.321372469419	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.212629602466	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.619376695819	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.394388220725	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.519621225248	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.224394852427	The number of women --
0.0	0.339080585191	Illegal.
0.0	0.258889844349	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.261225749696	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.688520926289	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.138619272492	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.21171927505	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.368349333598	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.475406138054	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.335242217571	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.205403417875	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.0994907218259	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.516954242762	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.886652354703	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.147368879952	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.19441962786	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.300850668178	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.655795524296	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.426017179859	It never happens.
0.0	0.0421985162906	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.742468061822	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.275575443926	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.720313949216	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.526655687919	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.248104067542	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.416429719869	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.383562184526	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.111468076115	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.779786530113	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.294407783741	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.773725355569	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.398721636231	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.224526009007	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.526249284404	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.743737696887	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.323039687174	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.512901444859	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.343140539962	I'm a fighter.

0.0	0.0534894171718	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.

1.0	0.801604970495	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.519760793946	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.593644375094	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.480317165463	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.36161688344	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.396347422987	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
1.0	0.456294892431	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.365360534497	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.150715470556	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.122307142829	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.292454415396	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.323300724643	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.113246628467	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.393574702533	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.299224740875	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.795630863774	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.193187446465	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.534464818072	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.614092561725	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.573088683697	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.5	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.279334573921	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.413052029118	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.48191103429	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.238401742467	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.531186437527	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.237047858185	We have no borders.
0.0	0.363463489424	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.368905814843	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.541320253301	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.386563153157	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
1.0	0.433138561863	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.330869380917	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.362555266523	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.630158895161	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.32100441676	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.397244071041	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.5	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.333154662915	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.791594783883	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.397537045251	I have no idea.
0.0	0.470576396391	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.430940803516	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.5	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.335985025495	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.471967534529	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.374740758397	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.667232996522	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.574100175917	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.602294537278	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.391472227664	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.776464475362	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.49474924864	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.0933220215963	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.372476080732	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.615839325986	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.221342060919	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.394763885534	That is not right.
0.0	0.751345394629	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.385446973746	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.243980822738	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.203341507926	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.5	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.28440212549	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.252895051985	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.265996898712	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.25382440571	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.429279478995	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.254995102034	Maria...
0.0	0.636162371497	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.532878026595	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.45231821537	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.72289956136	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.686153457863	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.228343566044	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
1.0	0.659409562139	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.163156633072	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.416667937118	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.577215834479	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.431878773562	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.743950028238	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.686326852094	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.296383926993	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.476279984383	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.322408299859	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.247764630832	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.278983804409	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.25707975627	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.442728729478	You did.
0.0	0.459853419003	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.412929524662	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.315841007989	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.492408027736	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.583863939184	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.716044748886	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.439093039756	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.394759017647	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.74420666295	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
1.0	0.910049967778	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.0767216358038	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.331190734941	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.44540920534	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.162672896377	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.927760556914	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.356180270817	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.553302328197	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.606977499783	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.115232815426	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.

0.0	0.477375492204	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.486176692405	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.682823491555	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.223434504742	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.387559841619	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.685148876019	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).

0.0	0.725998284261	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.

1.0	0.659409334912	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.282519205384	Right there, right next to the plant.

0.0	0.280073363602	You really can't.
0.0	0.6296974054	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.

0.0	0.263943260079	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.662394554561	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.349638746448	I will do that.

0.0	0.768636357565	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.0571463301592	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.467579805622	They go to Yale.

0.0	0.347128199547	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.0990972518082	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.63831566225	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.24027933881	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.528365071841	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.791905397287	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.244276301339	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.201432535778	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.268229835822	But I would add this.
0.0	0.5	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.286440385977	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.240468404028	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.573360913436	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.245852203165	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.381863649866	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.304268567801	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.376527505303	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.50869315476	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.689620202138	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.569607612468	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.741477034643	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.697551160277	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.137223940172	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.133143999977	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.199669106825	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.439274588967	So you know what?
0.0	0.541816144424	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.334037801293	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.15192599114	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.158894377559	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.384194880169	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.611672819583	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.464698361096	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.844596039471	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.488549244076	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.44237205183	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.523906795302	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.172221044081	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.434973406426	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.235741435318	Check it out.
0.0	0.780300614239	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.441925831656	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.544003531344	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
1.0	0.606416498004	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.78900371434	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.208673390513	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.474697251979	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.21052079147	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.525010502326	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.21327967184	You count on it.
0.0	0.475828605238	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.601853202872	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.192164956735	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.417178231811	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.556641382159	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.16061960516	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.663691684477	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.191132499751	And why?
0.0	0.5	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.585725781731	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.440373019104	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.176712882678	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.343453416178	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.132816777838	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.465989993913	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.367758187427	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.559396393899	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.562235731956	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.335541388401	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.866625871553	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.417290939983	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.431907076311	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.454619460177	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.490799593862	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.300539270547	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.349103973487	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.24802729337	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.108699498751	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.442923391238	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.568241723153	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.698142973792	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.681771167238	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.224715625017	You find me...

0.0	0.321274442109	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.534770368027	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.474497710532	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.

0.0	0.561117432312	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.289619267062	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.38385402505	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.695043024239	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.41510765051	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.580827783203	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.512219500983	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
1.0	0.899054473511	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.397112912301	Both served.

0.0	0.378034665113	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.870985970798	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.36454149852	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.448211898899	It's Hillary Clinton.

0.0	0.570325902381	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.463312418609	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.105193931517	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.571282477064	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.32902471125	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.

0.0	0.521849531684	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.190210012784	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.307779085482	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.

0.0	0.381455442342	We can do a wall.

0.0	0.381120867586	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.349190633682	Appreciate it.

0.0	0.529134728683	We cannot be the world's policeman.

0.0	0.449579813695	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.361865741351	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.608864271927	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.893298956488	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.123947784396	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.474828261924	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.

0.0	0.183996252075	Came out great.
0.0	0.340232165005	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.102208426977	Number -- and that is important for you to know.

0.0	0.420816835527	Well, I did.
0.0	0.303364628676	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.20425064846	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.300621030615	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.4770940559	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.377123152955	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.461516099375	That's the difference.
0.0	0.112527273675	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.350833931491	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.

0.0	0.410423750789	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.621105898357	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.391982707456	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.0222729463323	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
1.0	0.646513698079	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.727875173662	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.35931876126	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
1.0	0.621449051033	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.389780767089	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.449546937433	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.396747329076	You're right.
0.0	0.179043662286	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.395016111	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.286587852401	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.212541767516	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.508530162661	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.432169386077	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.645272012177	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.43158018638	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.490578911828	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.377127876979	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.373356688056	I have.
0.0	0.45544244775	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.429793555266	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.438033591967	We actually did it.
0.0	0.168828729113	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.449229874906	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.547040821918	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.410583980875	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.296142533083	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.

0.0	0.451126258271	to save a company.
0.0	0.515832838569	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.400554269712	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.465068496154	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.245766579077	We hear a lot of good plans.

0.0	0.555997309807	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.277502250091	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.0896341634326	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.405912104411	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.261120200459	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.342555076118	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.

0.0	0.548822048947	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.311659910843	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.3142807633	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.350067849941	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.54434079344	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.

0.0	0.543953662005	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.371229218338	This is a bad deal.

0.0	0.317635913175	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.41016567491	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.639693476739	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.353054928227	Total propaganda.

0.0	0.249103878296	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.554732406756	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.24359115119	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.507008280244	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.

0.0	0.318574655824	No.
0.0	0.282456377008	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.

0.0	0.357928952467	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.

0.0	0.674826917431	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.119010766886	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.

0.0	0.313463416748	Neil, I was mentioned too.

0.0	0.340171106028	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.

0.0	0.507472631469	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.

0.0	0.400008054006	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.487847051678	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.627181457028	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.00966603967639	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.289806334512	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.234898424782	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.23393661558	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.565753764732	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.445203321018	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.597009139193	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.467563920268	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.881410581472	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.570542587552	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.427805520474	Yeah, they are unhinged.
1.0	0.79960547628	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.281062359163	Or would you rather take less later on?
1.0	0.353868709348	Our military is a disaster.

0.0	0.29905269444	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.339171768847	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.174109267253	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.479823528287	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.477092635793	I never said that.
0.0	0.639680653874	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.666902982372	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.414985271164	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.322588035554	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.448788481746	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.33901237609	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.238673849237	And you can't do that to the party.
1.0	0.490271276325	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.658986985939	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.795834600901	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.127746331941	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.296641151447	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.30780472277	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.59538883158	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.349904757428	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.305811531226	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.356325561514	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.425819416751	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.422963317088	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
1.0	0.901926604579	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.315831366597	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
1.0	0.578264569174	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.447976038448	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.487460717212	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.531942773476	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.492692213781	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.596682085928	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.727333868138	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.220719328044	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.304776473416	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.157017978405	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.204837343222	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.366398693539	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.72334796294	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.172794675471	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.394763885534	That's not right.
0.0	0.494202838013	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.779321982778	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.695636237483	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.205651186478	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.349190633682	Thank you.
0.0	0.87031624961	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.433686783739	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.377764016823	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.219957576978	...
0.0	0.321535637607	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.537092445851	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.425089822746	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.332233378708	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.210904007665	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.410346054515	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.470826361173	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.642459262913	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.341449561793	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.5	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.459327874776	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.379806539224	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.637127740313	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.119789657649	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.423240868865	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.568954500395	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.230208717535	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.293796228067	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.38478176851	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.308723093666	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.321827917807	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.376864064427	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.695913982394	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.0613952330233	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.404710795292	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.412190244812	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.570845795221	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.400047416808	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.673221887749	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.247411876868	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.219714425931	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
1.0	0.6788925063	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.226566980589	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.163373210672	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.388030754159	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.192622032947	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.701069911972	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.532006076342	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.665302078331	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.344498030937	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.407054988499	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.942955471821	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.434252844666	We are not France.
0.0	0.283959028933	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.0802583864105	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.55588035555	He was on the board.
0.0	0.306116409136	Wait for what?
0.0	0.315328804921	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.446127710454	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.383653587118	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.335438912305	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.219957576978	...
0.0	0.396747329076	We haven't.
0.0	0.109022789679	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.0226756379722	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.339197701559	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.127280998561	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
1.0	0.5	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.198396543552	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.580090851525	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.444252361142	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.394823451819	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.573109388804	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.527767812043	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.100038700778	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.5	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.152844194488	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.558776176801	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.34673079819	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.590913601398	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.561556210729	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.596022150491	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.33772579664	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.296294762912	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.476594939689	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.663063625543	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.40697712622	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.675287910302	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.538523735322	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.831832099268	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.389422568638	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.716403113797	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.855397484049	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.588256717391	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.317504877936	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.53758034562	Two points.
0.0	0.365529571045	Creativity.
1.0	0.803529029167	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.373356688056	I do.
0.0	0.2101842918	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.165666358617	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.480033712819	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.540244629469	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.

0.0	0.412540833716	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.348990608902	Yeah.
0.0	0.873476702249	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.643126149118	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.155385047801	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.426146588567	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.535908514231	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.87968033088	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.140823986891	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.335239658044	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.

0.0	0.349127949099	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.203222829318	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.47921578841	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.236702872299	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.301195388996	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.603716418963	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.

0.0	0.539788274088	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.148196392455	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.081955241196	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.623789844895	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.298702926124	I like Marco Rubio.

0.0	0.277184243081	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.399105262618	What you need to do is free up interest rates.

1.0	0.568449621914	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.200055924772	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.650339271892	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.345071344629	How great is that?
0.0	0.297721295457	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.746008462831	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.5	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.

0.0	0.417483726526	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.

0.0	0.58236822974	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.

0.0	0.827538703101	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.437831322907	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.334043248592	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.259793791588	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.471506365745	White people?
0.0	0.383053175041	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.446852632104	That's what he is.
0.0	0.25407186227	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.339285173425	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.442495236461	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.246833524847	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.

0.0	0.445266836277	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.077496317952	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.365398031618	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.

0.0	0.42757017243	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.386602780189	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.228466264939	You just want to...
0.0	0.244390307076	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.637245138109	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.172925282338	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.342809335913	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.366293236936	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.526125094423	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.427825574851	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.627376155981	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.213363282467	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.696255661703	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.399897139702	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.472816055927	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.216972585072	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.236414427477	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.528879961617	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.537270456684	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.354557374447	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.398009270723	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.741138650508	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.578153152367	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.229225869207	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.292065254594	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.404579923401	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.255450206763	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.434898682078	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.321204642357	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.486918343353	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.399498288616	That's right.
0.0	0.357037233787	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.193063730817	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.626541645918	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.405756501678	You have to lead.
0.0	0.178005682465	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.52881207832	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.384193491595	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.269714859672	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.265071118994	Why?
0.0	0.400527448181	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
1.0	0.470529274631	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.191351380849	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.261687321844	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.67528547735	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.313252129997	They know.
0.0	0.474454170504	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.119526987409	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.267823852465	We don't need that.
0.0	0.210399443545	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.82377974348	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.604560974393	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.631185863832	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.65275216685	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.300037528649	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.114147338257	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.348990608902	Okay.
0.0	0.538678561407	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.170069180542	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
1.0	0.6593891248	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.541614217376	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.843261745641	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.460322339429	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.664568242479	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.37588020291	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.313016956352	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.611976016079	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.259907147342	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.648088302525	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.891712032186	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.368779706726	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.4781734442	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.783796322907	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.405755969922	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.485200285309	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.506670511086	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.219754055748	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.220719328044	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.540220520848	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.559777395199	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.184092948593	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.348990608902	OK?
0.0	0.330913796323	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.440439887326	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.520993384263	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.167858664472	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.732276012325	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.559388918641	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.395622698241	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.433562600329	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.54149993896	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.331448594622	I will run on my record all day long.
1.0	0.645191477245	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.467924348881	She was right.
0.0	0.422444879861	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.366373563002	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.333744864795	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.113515689214	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.133690237066	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.46044090148	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.274060518084	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.431088596094	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.5	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.416112075665	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.201775409115	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.293128600076	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.434898682078	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.559823807859	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.1368160111	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.394514319031	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.4448222561	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.38161646643	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.308980894606	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.405759414552	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.576129245168	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.756654722501	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.362889064455	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.216589830957	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.396747329076	You get together.
0.0	0.404981786588	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.410479462726	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.317449767032	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.784575642423	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.478697533618	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.561409292977	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.336946719766	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.191662360837	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.356411353726	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.278674797869	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.5	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.521291301748	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.410502528612	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.36200347098	I would change them.
0.0	0.71251668994	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.524797818755	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.429400032726	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.511632365857	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.15438853074	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.201090798559	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.521485844049	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.205138264182	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.038425246431	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.265975096014	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.233444444704	I've laid out...
0.0	0.786989257246	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.349087847396	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.511938224961	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.401348340065	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.777183916707	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.261661922939	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.304680805173	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.491573955023	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.393132919632	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.688000151147	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.457468353972	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.361592222723	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.341010849451	Say again?
0.0	0.386258789833	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.644317197732	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.317412031437	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.482460260283	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.560148821997	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.461446971248	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.282104350418	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.31758538462	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.532626381568	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.283405688863	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.30983101702	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.399561618448	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
1.0	0.507857960117	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.446939963156	I was not at all.
0.0	0.766083713975	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.480473287716	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.356125737543	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.708402913949	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.894645904586	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.729590498485	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.196896455995	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.5352158325	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.308515426215	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.0798410208693	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.414299608649	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.130625606622	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.488000585193	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.288573116379	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.146180990397	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.0568149527379	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.285121542055	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.484484622945	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.23880265464	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.703444736642	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.273877127822	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.290614566559	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.17330553797	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.478104205918	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.421873745528	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.467817240676	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.362661346095	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.372587713053	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.174094330044	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.462317606404	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.439265094229	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.252430047502	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.804153985739	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.306071843082	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.811314343994	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
1.0	0.521124141218	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.622697613907	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.864503182873	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.309147622618	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
1.0	0.670719181565	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.389263532679	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.850079176552	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.472597416795	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.0808517544761	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.456407930654	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.197664302334	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.288239683769	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.492352253184	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.511235359486	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.195297637227	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.407144219511	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.322830041759	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.387361905182	We have to do something.
0.0	0.0891785951987	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.524328157566	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.555778496815	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.307984425042	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.360763909193	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.819204802004	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.0871544536513	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.160859454653	And...
0.0	0.253813486124	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.430520606818	I got that.
0.0	0.491431095582	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.310994824791	No, John.
0.0	0.065771051345	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
1.0	0.563669794653	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.271013363495	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.987863452966	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.335304491616	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.348990608902	Yes.
0.0	0.56777291296	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.867844503117	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.183598143465	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.445467966693	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.319033097681	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
1.0	0.879295701117	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.478178238542	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.359490905916	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.583609301409	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.277847552013	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.303315163487	That's for sure.
0.0	0.230501938154	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.273139359123	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.279564469653	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.768586458166	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.17093845058	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.120832183895	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.255265790156	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.321884443983	So you might not.
0.0	0.177139225482	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.256601216367	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.383446390698	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.290837598041	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.431698353129	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.390846145017	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.268180941145	But I think they will see a very good option here.
1.0	0.745925247973	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.155738934625	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.246213833036	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.437957093395	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.506052011555	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.690164409982	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.597429249317	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.135624804713	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.444021503667	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.506853800286	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.345975806123	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.118106637753	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.483007117122	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.416050433245	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.26789363208	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.513318654851	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.348982224829	Right.
0.0	0.422653966141	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.406886184095	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.365817056369	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.474649103469	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.250132877849	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.601232764943	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.792940016966	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.509051431316	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.217922545581	John, I'd like to address this?

0.0	0.101496597277	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.407270263561	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.386391952012	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.458758193955	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.

0.0	0.81071743688	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.207187991743	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.129335628323	And here's the last piece...

0.0	0.200266894757	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.305830880772	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.450570355559	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.111923364143	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.5	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.

0.0	0.226734931627	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.332296780894	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.361191346062	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.394721829696	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.202769391229	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.312749249245	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.544341619849	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.303700335036	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.348594528226	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.114532500518	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.581176062724	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.509410232046	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.197323347687	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.465468268326	You know why three?
0.0	0.360060680162	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.261348538827	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.394055160598	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.340129522228	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.3614688355	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.288598257651	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.3662704753	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.159684394459	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.412862107192	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.358616586672	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.449156350967	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.431208236684	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.262167796375	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.278425820882	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.536402592704	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.980569671189	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.316034250485	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.274117399628	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.

0.0	0.685564272047	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.479238985912	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.441630942472	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.5	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.410253012024	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.715303533058	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.434105719603	He's wrong.
0.0	0.475304773449	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.275551750624	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.798997665316	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.6660887862	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.333122678402	We're friends.
0.0	0.578420448267	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.645055402806	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.361709816848	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.5	We need sound money.
0.0	0.314768614279	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.352648421309	And you know what?
0.0	0.162231756345	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.369881171442	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.41460302135	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.404880234719	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.385973144164	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.599243555782	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.319942645661	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.360941040375	Alright.
1.0	0.659355172774	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.0775687566806	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.203365251263	I don't care.
0.0	0.255623836172	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.270742016434	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.344332360176	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.76489966516	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.482618538151	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.448314843799	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.558725214686	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.374880594408	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.418025856535	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.360499979099	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.369782468494	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.53666568659	We are lowering taxes on small business.

0.0	0.540672403921	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.346540371498	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.512757481592	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.941686525481	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.269103853884	They're off to China.
0.0	0.469482170643	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.222925275803	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.645915635438	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.480840702532	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.277669524773	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.0747615713702	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.676599293637	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.517192891782	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.479829645185	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.438042700828	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.293767498936	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.368591064725	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.800558778271	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.775622857399	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.252534518564	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.315716214095	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.317007384192	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.322545723703	This is 2016.
0.0	0.553118879986	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.622023868629	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.677924709963	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.57301764605	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.396333548855	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.558025463932	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.169017151551	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.492388891441	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.356029549274	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.313471686515	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.541389787968	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.5	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.157945209097	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.759415457914	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.477092635793	I never said that.
1.0	0.360702259338	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.602735680844	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.704114446538	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.449224627991	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.46309196507	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.382653849528	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
