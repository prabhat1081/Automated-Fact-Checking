0.0	0.497280825157	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.496611674905	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.491626101586	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.490891704724	It should be what are your substantive positions...
1.0	0.497960564273	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.500979521211	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.490340817233	I want security.
0.0	0.540726947816	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.508603512895	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.494608617414	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.500395902499	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.497785435669	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.490386830391	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.501506998762	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.507847771623	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.497276429283	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.505703511428	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.445488224645	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.506892134125	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.500559594566	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.497008202554	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.49643312475	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.501553324276	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.395812144672	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.484479309843	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.504813647745	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.498709395371	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.391955856279	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.493896356467	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.490092065251	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.489486149596	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.498955034937	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.492545428476	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.498254788449	And you know what?
0.0	0.49809689246	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.483835660987	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.496983436661	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.508366676799	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.498254788449	And you know what?
0.0	0.494083689488	You find me...
0.0	0.49814497469	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.493689043377	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.491392922904	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.493421357265	OK, good.
0.0	0.496909314993	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.499946169106	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.35364988954	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.498232514823	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.5101564329	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.500002894079	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.499599218525	But I was born here.
0.0	0.438609304655	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.490912831724	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
1.0	0.496502224845	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.460013670295	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.494750204796	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.509441209184	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.499563823933	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.497927336272	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.49171591901	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.545403789656	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.492224738334	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.490623714806	Think about it.
0.0	0.497747841499	A lot has happened in nine months.
1.0	0.504650919593	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.494378039994	You count on it.
0.0	0.502048241182	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.484699245292	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.501422459924	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.513281727777	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.504996430142	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.475237668496	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.512843392773	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.516090136297	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.491007839622	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.506652989158	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.494766434491	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.474808714561	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.494000577635	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.501858954063	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.405993167056	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.498600185763	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.493300179903	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.496856814689	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.493718611116	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.491453890224	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.502024583399	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.487338266059	I don't like that.
0.0	0.488110409845	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
1.0	0.513489399833	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.49474462047	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.495272265877	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.49164031929	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.369813695287	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.491976853653	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.495736558793	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
1.0	0.507793213086	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.489720638361	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.493301562997	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.505025152613	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.501361283734	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.498254788449	And you know what?
0.0	0.493836125309	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.489931487488	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.496844735396	You gotta be patient.
1.0	0.510014047985	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.494848929007	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.495447912859	Well, it's interesting.
1.0	0.57787063768	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.497205071801	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.502857491503	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.351811028887	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.486903444025	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.500847631917	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.491339617607	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.571968889043	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.478542440696	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.491512903174	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.496593920727	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.50510161717	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.498278028263	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.494198927587	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.512650342047	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.488317930034	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.499718599806	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.497510829392	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.498738962362	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.512419812751	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.487706553151	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.496640174867	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.494033877118	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.493419423004	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.492930459681	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.507604273288	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
1.0	0.51546906752	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.503653385594	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.496601708017	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.504385870886	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.398569123608	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.486903444025	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.510524593184	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.491921148206	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.563000104309	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.494063071825	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.498038050179	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.50311259955	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.499436089754	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.509607282855	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.494276910942	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.494305561572	But I would add this.
0.0	0.501669429681	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.497025361194	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.499677502851	That is our government today.
0.0	0.489925169241	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.494347228611	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.498576888204	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.498787314102	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.499829963118	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.393999963673	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.503194240221	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.491943266328	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.491947747776	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.492491833948	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.498345516832	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
1.0	0.502403766612	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.505951526946	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.497098840227	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.491358253134	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.501576315558	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.50133269347	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.496960103147	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.497917814958	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.500698427336	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.514808642251	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.498513336895	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.499135227342	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.520959456006	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.491976853653	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.51313699966	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.488473887511	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.512251105521	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.494004804577	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.50549212821	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.495753092425	I said no.
0.0	0.491976853653	We haven't.
0.0	0.501851404217	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.444112721264	Creativity.
0.0	0.356180410867	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.500268284409	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.484195644579	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.497822306121	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.494304492063	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.519852327603	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.444112721264	No.
0.0	0.49221001732	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.494925604432	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.572227235448	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.489832208517	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.520110873396	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.494912146584	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.503888826314	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.492694189214	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.407109075152	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.493055696281	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.499756982853	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.49355512489	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.501492136295	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.490622713376	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.49487443061	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.474336188691	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.497231609654	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.494127693655	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.501950464702	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.510377982081	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.493555603693	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.361116061554	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.493775052876	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.499383345736	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.493638376054	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.490163406129	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.506807679329	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.494241750559	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.485453903174	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.497062691372	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.395559122343	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.490623714806	Divide that out.
0.0	0.492735289226	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.495997759964	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.509656495845	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.503158952616	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.493277103214	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.492469705473	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.501586899523	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.386571480104	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.48800278995	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.501288336393	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.495832034209	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.497681830003	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.502421185364	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.508871979158	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.497845059422	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.495605710915	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.508675478062	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.492771253378	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.49557594848	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.502185105743	But the poll numbers have.
1.0	0.509851793786	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.494731343854	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.492088696586	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.513698282271	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.491514688804	You know that.
0.0	0.490621988578	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.537406159824	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.484948382755	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.486674633097	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
1.0	0.504975542146	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.499661021024	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.471964263443	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.490234396276	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.493038492099	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.496721911729	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.494791695481	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.49923892781	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.350821312763	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.49561151771	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.491534683239	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.495143787228	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.398693628012	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.493399830537	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.500334850973	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.48804167764	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.494222852964	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.490623714806	Check it out.
0.0	0.500077621255	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.494942655503	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.489253695206	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.496133299231	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.506277380497	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.496013805365	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.496787640156	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.50217804179	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.498723043601	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
1.0	0.511043240664	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.494141981008	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.499455380564	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.409960311606	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.485710266809	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.488006159452	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.491216687937	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.500479283835	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.496470905972	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.497356436881	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.406768054168	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.495852097053	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.521463858032	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.49704641259	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.355831557241	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.486227944385	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.357060308058	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
1.0	0.495822700992	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.493437140015	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.500057510003	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.492709909032	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.490368782457	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.490322648201	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.495548727274	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.490488700741	I agree with them.
0.0	0.475891051574	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.507125472924	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.500319285039	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.540471986562	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.505351789944	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.489778487695	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
1.0	0.59141701508	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.492376309129	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.503266930077	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.506190104963	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.491024325981	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.484592551627	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.485545432325	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.452475571605	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.485511548902	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.493004322558	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.40478947923	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.494513901189	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.491468283157	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.38594858515	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.491221740794	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.493280843545	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
1.0	0.522449458545	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.497846991436	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.484200589062	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.497082171343	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.420791677612	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.493485814612	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.492333090658	I've done it.
0.0	0.543558339443	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.500291033258	He was on the board.
0.0	0.503699746452	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.497121463798	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.503443894232	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.519974405846	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.487601129854	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.444449255627	Right.
1.0	0.518333718155	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.49612997876	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.362610277756	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.498370709662	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.497935368255	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.490170426636	We can't do it.
0.0	0.521226052755	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.502995653862	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.497827438942	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.51203470421	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.510805111541	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.499361822836	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.491856047862	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.513362400721	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.486457882884	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.490766029607	We have to do something.
0.0	0.494955561829	That's not true.
0.0	0.502244209231	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.426341868992	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.500569937938	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.495839788099	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.4013801827	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.497734933155	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.499295846455	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.494377532946	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.486363981427	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.484795934936	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.489833942425	I can do that.
0.0	0.495807670845	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.480902895467	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.497048260457	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.494977601572	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.492526694219	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.494013353014	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.492345207894	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.4971620377	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.49348335269	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.492111876923	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.510098140612	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.403537194412	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.444449255627	Right.
0.0	0.53250496893	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.49359602926	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.48984448648	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.507970686041	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.482836242548	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.496682390724	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.500191176479	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.504756411778	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.486030214364	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.491107843172	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.546342963338	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.497416760448	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.520780324107	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.502538345479	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.498254788449	And you know what?
0.0	0.50337251247	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.498235283047	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.49464852797	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.40808042228	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.497677077625	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.505951915518	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.502136785387	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.494585737368	That will change everything.
0.0	0.492960872009	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.496460216101	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.500683334175	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.511989090145	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.494913534433	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.516167599852	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.44367015281	Yeah.
0.0	0.494149824147	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.498810666971	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.500522248267	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.49596522013	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.490565446088	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.497833260665	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.390764404237	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.494604880266	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.482017543104	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.481543024613	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.494923995624	And for good cause.
0.0	0.497769217753	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.49104731994	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.496164275763	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.499047246811	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.527545589341	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.49809440601	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.513724423054	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
1.0	0.510815702347	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.505828404433	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.501511847759	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.499105678303	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.513394429462	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.495634680527	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.494421602959	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.528345161877	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.509795909565	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.349721417698	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.496192024173	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.500983305835	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.491766360277	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.500889573623	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.493490790259	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.487158905515	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.488218807925	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.496682497488	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.49047204674	He undermines it.
0.0	0.49301938943	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.502929650238	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.493784164313	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.48787586096	I like it.
0.0	0.485032729391	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.499305325333	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.498786047028	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.50822039215	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.500717610676	It's never been that way in American politics before.
1.0	0.494295698216	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.500959926839	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.472482902714	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.402164082496	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.501994223855	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.485084368966	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.497532344892	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.505480335952	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.496271822294	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.481645803303	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.491672199751	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.444449255627	Dynamically.
0.0	0.502586860382	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.491014313297	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.506136848991	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.502073950137	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.499899073698	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.501648469084	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.491834538852	It never happens.
0.0	0.412554558693	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.48749664861	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.488038871629	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.496732838777	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.503006863752	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.495219557342	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.500142344279	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.495630183289	You can't do it with empty promised.
1.0	0.503226375623	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.507574794398	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.493050544948	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.496382487404	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.497443934197	They're a scam.
0.0	0.501692192169	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.495169673814	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.493106185435	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
1.0	0.502323315385	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.510036661331	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.488163202084	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.491827085003	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.49661185286	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.486610724676	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.489421257017	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.491902825582	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
1.0	0.495593829264	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.49959166395	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.502816344739	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.494837255843	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.501654079298	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.497779546709	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.356596271439	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.50082154618	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.491976853653	You're right.
0.0	0.496002896997	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.494241795902	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.490326852481	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.506869377027	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.488687551232	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.505204267477	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.500598249666	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.498365550474	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.499812549812	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.

0.0	0.485684421454	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.49058289446	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.495266406212	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
1.0	0.510552300252	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.490202682889	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.498840448238	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.495576048155	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.508518658712	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.504071052654	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.496997828529	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.481990904381	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.491887333561	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.499335064761	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.505635780912	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.491097293209	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.502139843084	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.498260325271	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.341359846957	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.542098477884	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.49315114505	In addition to that...
0.0	0.499386938835	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.387635193433	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.494900490393	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.495781922343	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.500915071596	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.513746584902	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.489756253776	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.496466721811	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.497884334715	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.492612406114	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.510557393274	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.500756928912	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.501202937069	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.491976853653	You get together.
0.0	0.499208948263	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.487910215477	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.492325197585	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.508071917103	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.501639861404	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.495281403685	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.494213013456	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.498844711082	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.493701144268	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.497984067364	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.359726998611	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.495320962503	We actually did it.
0.0	0.492724693078	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.50078505438	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.497849358492	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.496302373298	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.494447161082	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.557211660667	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.488463239082	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.501833366806	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.511723254822	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.494459743824	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.497783418241	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.409472395461	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.493409513959	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.409726694769	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.509051497966	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.487338266059	They don't like that.
0.0	0.354174934359	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.492337580553	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.494110433141	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.4901696893	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.494099646116	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.492252028117	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.511891516486	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.49281102653	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.491383957899	And we are not England.
0.0	0.488620095988	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.493084490457	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.503607860534	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.506589579174	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.359359020531	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.513779241666	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.494049372927	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.491020963177	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.493723690091	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.516100636943	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.529499810048	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.495928558508	My point is this.
0.0	0.492070034139	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.491044729865	So you might not.
0.0	0.487760244448	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.406413855618	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.490461556786	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.493198715559	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.500118022955	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
1.0	0.504363709909	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.500716221597	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.48760618532	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.403438448467	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.41948167805	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.504987110389	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.506716368228	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.502872231288	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.469799208849	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.494965705145	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.509814599186	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.493878500342	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.485521160686	You just want to...
0.0	0.507535965443	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.469206175641	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.488676996829	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.501701049014	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.498001611364	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.501182741603	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.406216862319	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.496397803347	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.490402157409	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.498416375988	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
1.0	0.530631572964	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.507299429536	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.502130320933	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.395812144672	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.49468542452	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.490551861434	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.499211056079	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.501150155272	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.495619603464	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.496647717438	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.497903130378	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.496838085103	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.502589903357	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.493408725644	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.484489106736	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
1.0	0.502345857941	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.496595048808	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.49501782754	I love this country.
0.0	0.496687294693	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.411968838503	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.541524758936	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.499654881664	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.487927277931	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.510449075977	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.494647818496	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.492635119711	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.500626700866	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.497969765838	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.500217824777	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.35699895425	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.499120463823	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.506750247325	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.497809208047	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.507247863597	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.489203935382	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.486747281393	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.507067335155	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.486537229484	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.480772528102	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.358226867749	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.352247072232	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.514003230278	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.493854809514	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.507961147233	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.389748918624	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.496471595528	I have no idea.
0.0	0.549694823023	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.492797296521	That's my view.
0.0	0.494566896187	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.513130761413	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.492089160237	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
1.0	0.505564108269	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.517642332796	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.51140901579	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.506829557197	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.49400233917	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.495836655993	When we do business with China, they tax us.
1.0	0.513532943215	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.495803341384	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.495254517652	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.392323476298	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.413450967216	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.49123048252	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.358733307488	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.356660051446	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.509903694903	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.489107103976	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.498542113152	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.50098632653	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.430995981418	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.500200012701	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.494262624351	He's wrong.
0.0	0.51467860321	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.492669638905	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.486513641213	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.506990577595	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.492956176632	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.510169535069	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.506935576167	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.486384839031	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.497042030766	You're simply not.
0.0	0.494664701413	Can we stop?
0.0	0.566543844617	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.494886938169	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.513207495064	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.49017229946	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.50097319713	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.497876876297	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.497113402599	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.410092160929	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.488512966184	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.500025146136	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.491567955601	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.495269103844	...income tax...
0.0	0.496575184089	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.496927332069	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.500939403282	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.443632524657	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.493742939688	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.48903044404	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.492732064849	I've laid out...
0.0	0.500139042131	Marco voted on the other side.
1.0	0.513993392231	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.542507919883	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.493125208271	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.478387642135	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.500198079497	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.356025540009	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.358953901351	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.503630245793	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.495646400555	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.489964853407	They know.
0.0	0.492635814492	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.533639963872	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.354952613107	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.498396380297	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.503231496588	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.512517771312	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.497977700078	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.497808357617	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.486644889016	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.495491518199	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.492669638905	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.351229181954	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.496545409527	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.500089556259	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.489920450755	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.489495580411	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.492037247298	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.542273006876	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.49889170394	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.513209312378	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.496687840207	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.500665204542	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.501902198116	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.527066401878	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.506030449542	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.499948762293	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.521757134536	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.503894514267	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.393607972121	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.499216991278	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.495943089425	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.493091296058	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.501541763586	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.507983043233	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.529830412178	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.509795861099	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.500872036084	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.494146074247	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.558352472523	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.495701707045	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.493187989171	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.499949663971	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.499787365226	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.487689079928	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.563516803928	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.498723454891	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.506452950529	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.495698677719	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.491202051262	That's not right.

0.0	0.494023686071	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.497342187845	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.499143359445	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.508853463487	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.496934723071	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.

0.0	0.494558569318	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.500289987191	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.

0.0	0.498254788449	And you know what?
1.0	0.503803393097	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.

1.0	0.364295537514	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.500725443869	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.

0.0	0.496413767808	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.501772234469	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.5015943379	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.492316115422	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.483499235581	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.

0.0	0.507120716438	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.410248255339	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.498437506723	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.495740734348	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.501779104158	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.497562749269	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.498238652912	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.493188649091	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.506668605137	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.489158521334	I can.
0.0	0.487093573279	I have...
0.0	0.498897574541	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.50007555215	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.494869897053	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.491858265356	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.499877672876	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.498031271749	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.504290459056	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.501298057731	It's driving up stock prices.
1.0	0.504071665354	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.49164031929	That's all I'm saying.
1.0	0.511243715119	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.509475020035	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.487147443993	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.489529616316	That has not been...
0.0	0.493611697625	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.485221316149	...Chris...
0.0	0.478208657029	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.497629280459	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.507908701514	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.493082433416	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.500961564879	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.468503365378	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.504946547968	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.488435199987	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.498622645532	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.49662042804	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.513381064011	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.498770980854	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.357235150975	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.476954561505	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.498718664834	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.49580133576	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.506515690131	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.487864937528	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.501950848878	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.518070949899	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.495531588057	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.496324147484	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.497175922256	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.497738373336	This is 2016.
0.0	0.508631336747	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.509522122576	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.495231894792	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.494708866669	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.508178290116	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.499095512475	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.51278453468	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.494466241735	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.530104148507	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.578805633556	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.471428097973	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.552082711571	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.493741253396	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.394540759808	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.495161168248	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.493758807683	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.50203294447	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.441241509759	These...
0.0	0.502353548056	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.494970963244	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.496868292485	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.497377730221	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
1.0	0.496045895765	That's wrong.
0.0	0.505636983329	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.496373360146	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.494996653407	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.50053545821	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.496848429089	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.492529764713	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.491229324298	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.496200899889	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.49326422965	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.494049372927	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.497999442532	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.495230666707	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.505965132842	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.492276590024	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.498250118774	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.511252674864	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.360043964739	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.490714337192	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.487443455017	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.489061536804	I will not do that.
0.0	0.493834092421	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.486599208038	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.41331298211	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.355182462924	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.482711657643	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.497222598649	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.494818525224	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.500788530588	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.495059144503	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.486432647576	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.492077242455	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.495538902945	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.49164031929	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.50129392033	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.49070314379	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.521649816155	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.496643765412	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.41917199941	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.492315736022	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.490782587531	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.494262624351	That's good.
0.0	0.498959486671	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.502179393274	She voted for it.
0.0	0.397576835577	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.492131762761	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.495242139036	How great is that?
0.0	0.493769263203	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.488847651434	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.484380021724	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.485135993457	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.499088983833	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.5067719427	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.497725341535	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.509910131978	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.492519205413	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.496144422863	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.488702694164	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.495810449383	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.499787478189	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.494981057668	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.489142319955	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.491969884915	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.499873581304	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.494966393388	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.486696172974	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.48287647098	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.490926657754	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.488976728976	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.554626784533	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.489184110131	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.498218493976	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.493659171079	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.496787818075	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.495588197592	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.489502104315	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.506638382379	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.488097065798	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.498753901763	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.498930535233	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.515742802432	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.49190422654	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.503349001208	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.3726545831	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.363946194748	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
1.0	0.501946483209	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.499331422187	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.401131318389	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.355440662476	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.62690367239	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.501422764043	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.483800336247	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.509129343644	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.490170426636	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.49702470375	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.49263042145	We will arm and train the Kurds.
1.0	0.510318804079	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.488673938189	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.49883954216	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.492822981353	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.402377890254	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.489410385023	Say again?
0.0	0.497403933596	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.494299511603	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.489473952799	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.486770436586	No -- no...
0.0	0.487546649875	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.490690163714	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.542964969264	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.500943816983	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.564716634596	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.496050820275	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.358422741194	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.488352028287	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.491976853653	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.401750565658	...No, sir...
0.0	0.505589938117	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.470829733664	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.496083326208	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.489713990778	It's true.
0.0	0.489875369234	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.497722304807	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.493363623967	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.495536341648	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.502704267576	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.491146741245	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.490985401475	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.506033271531	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.493046369489	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.494251997756	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.495222768547	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.495718869444	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.489420107058	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.502791026936	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.489201200407	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.496629556002	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.497140237297	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.489112673543	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.506709051919	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.509149015484	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.364894786128	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.51105325458	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.503842477768	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.504332510437	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.500844115398	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.495999533748	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.496413767808	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.503726722795	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.500400040876	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.409472395461	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.444449255627	Ever.
0.0	0.49065330119	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.506134338676	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.353466844838	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.492982344415	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.499116991046	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.509978339292	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.499585881697	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.507951934159	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.491513684836	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.517519292972	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.404329814358	... his answer -- you name it.
1.0	0.504581042385	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.496449711564	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.488173752298	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.487338266059	We don't need that.
0.0	0.510325130266	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.48935264502	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.520620413744	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.503614369062	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.492701097772	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.501749720073	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.40806229559	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.384035034977	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.491221121736	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.496098464716	Came out great.
0.0	0.492105282483	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.49700701279	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.499999252958	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.503799724556	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.490614955316	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.498067561224	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.489206069698	And why?
0.0	0.495317699155	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.505748966999	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.498794550927	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.497162819835	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.496224127968	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.505623277213	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.501003757048	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.509094140586	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.494915791741	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.487413305754	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.489291067922	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.494711575452	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.501918713094	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.503671551538	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.493822439281	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.501565899858	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.493786695918	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.49758715201	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.490811418551	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.497176774778	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.497317381634	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.497748459951	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.496239536733	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.505865815695	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.509795027511	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.491555594466	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.501018361993	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.502587127414	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.49862210349	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.493991330689	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
1.0	0.540537327246	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.506020261693	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.494638588386	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.48714224265	That's what we need.
0.0	0.490437495471	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.499944664232	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.439322702068	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.490814346526	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.499583738938	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.382793730771	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.491025091462	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.495090460465	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.498864506893	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.503619485848	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.490797265065	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.506818320271	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.50059985786	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.494454919414	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.516309121006	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.530832007054	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.441241509759	Neil...
0.0	0.494781143477	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.498136839756	I'm tested.
0.0	0.506922545829	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.500512284144	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.497983753748	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.491122636915	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.607933613373	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.498477082146	But many, many people did.
1.0	0.509805738222	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.498542900528	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.48787586096	I like that.
0.0	0.494443797285	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.518174775474	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.500024881633	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.489284447262	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.500292656335	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.493236815818	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.523091062567	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.498558803635	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.495672939281	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.496688193386	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.487189297445	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.400029247423	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.488083652591	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.401791899815	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.493647294335	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.499715171684	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.499257158022	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.487466296529	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.494050185818	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.502589449809	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.515465037249	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.499398329889	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.482771187367	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.495097109657	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.490237313504	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.495620292619	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.498695442705	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.504596260835	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.499181324723	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.491512903174	No their not.
0.0	0.361228858959	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.50044725715	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.499954532288	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.490686077744	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.481646043851	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.50550593624	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.490170426636	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.499064163413	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.495710041135	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.501932975744	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.503608080646	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.493045794244	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.489032862403	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.500985600412	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.441241509759	...
0.0	0.497834515202	You have to lead.
0.0	0.555606317388	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.441577924723	Again...
0.0	0.483982366644	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.503760529381	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.495579019252	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.496994609856	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.491383070562	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.496376633101	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.49100359395	You looking at me?
0.0	0.484195644579	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.351964907035	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.497914473547	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.492009804995	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.383355728389	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.490919099379	You really can't.
0.0	0.476783078006	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.495852464396	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.566163884565	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.495019175672	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
1.0	0.499288141024	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.500457652323	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.501030100598	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.491864533217	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.494252414628	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.492038165944	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.498258475879	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.49214676948	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.493102290117	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.496202992705	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.5036615486	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.388679827361	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.486881448247	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.492486311656	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.502594602609	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.495223210824	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.493312308186	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.490464612385	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.481563315661	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.498411968155	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.501990631233	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.49032012659	...before I go.
0.0	0.493018673727	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.494723175502	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.495345835734	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.490168954951	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.503627831696	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.492249297721	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.500318536698	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.515202563859	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.497594959056	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.497875040897	We were wrong.
0.0	0.493068630833	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.496202992705	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.493231402867	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.500520185566	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.491016997256	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.476957852592	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.482038352066	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.537416357165	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.493850745258	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.502638068014	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.49046564615	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.508389570609	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.503071572216	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.523119849701	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.511437518921	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.502796889675	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.494927786991	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.351286980243	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.487213699821	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.496562584761	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.390752876812	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.497654757859	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.547038783671	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.495764599751	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.497254718389	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.49585358461	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.488874477474	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.479912779919	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.400154792569	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.488262130373	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.489229763407	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.518347057112	You had two one hundred...
1.0	0.50486166985	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.490272705342	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.491518087376	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.493177417261	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.496783777359	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.502235642845	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.497016157775	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.501102406454	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.497176130904	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.499694210493	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.502778878718	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.269268058658	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.494618650597	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.481525686316	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.507144444566	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.498714150064	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.497559130916	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.506461079127	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.513657585076	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.491778901204	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.492417190009	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.485453903174	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.492501523104	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.395483087514	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.497565049985	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.496400863146	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.498254788449	But you know what?
0.0	0.471183799259	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.493215971973	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.504270284718	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.493365242106	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.509670723622	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.492346224946	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.491685381603	How about this?
0.0	0.498468158578	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.495059903111	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.488763072112	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.486951258478	That is...
0.0	0.4927936311	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.489955247407	And here's why.
0.0	0.488985798776	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.507434506051	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.49106928021	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.492155608011	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.497045124196	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.500641512489	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.499069398796	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.489676731051	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.501192988018	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.495446615532	I didn't.
0.0	0.494632737174	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.499167158755	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.499162274819	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.495110023165	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.494671905519	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.36485866238	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.368248956652	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.495816560246	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.490692227983	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.490262876084	Well, sure.
0.0	0.498290248555	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.492327625742	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.472095514624	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.499019780267	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.484908233999	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.496237692641	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.486264926043	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.506498456515	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.50280606889	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.486790062468	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.49360749337	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.502269185676	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.486519192488	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
1.0	0.502299995716	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.501934260067	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.399599368678	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.495388003267	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.49068447158	No, no.
0.0	0.491272199087	I love China.
0.0	0.489840416499	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.507888692511	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.492268416911	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.495562846598	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.503142309414	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.492232207971	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.49286646445	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.3933141276	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.502027726507	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.579124225339	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.48109923582	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.498460157098	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.496813351573	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.392972214721	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.508248059905	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.497845258952	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.503263507678	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.499128351198	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.486234516296	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.491834538852	It never happens.
0.0	0.499835532782	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.492639682608	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.511963269328	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.382432080883	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.441241509759	Becky --
0.0	0.494987582465	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.53542425428	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.494490410681	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.559418778737	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.494589365594	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
1.0	0.5069350556	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.473745392506	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.493963530557	No vision at all.
0.0	0.467896260105	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.496645641028	And I would not support those.
1.0	0.494855468417	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.490982412761	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.496647604197	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.496860620865	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.492894318038	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.493330920169	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.508270525069	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.502446785341	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.502896676931	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.491554589969	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.502950895172	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.490515593398	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.500315855007	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.522488961153	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.50741069067	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.494497962862	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.569937497773	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.444449255627	Absolutely.
0.0	0.49341389937	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.505093801652	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.470855112821	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.494383747555	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.494517457734	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.486644889016	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.491498004489	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.495861515918	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.499260202578	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.516266352604	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.510412542567	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.478735084634	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.492208997036	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.488645293044	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.499358471971	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.501672186198	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.39232130054	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.4803802425	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.496912994194	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.49079042703	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.504516588903	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
1.0	0.502391715167	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.444449255627	Right.
0.0	0.501889012752	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.497441473512	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.500056171181	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.495637018639	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.557991403322	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
1.0	0.567364447052	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.49767816749	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.490651586787	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.502351968469	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.491344429747	We need security.
0.0	0.491690503719	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.489335169232	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.49474462047	A brief response.
0.0	0.503531509577	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.491788969846	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.403085185757	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.505551010658	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.497322435584	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.477780198607	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.503373466442	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.508058049378	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.493056430398	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.508772185132	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.50578253297	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.494378997369	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.512869159457	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
1.0	0.496922294529	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.492374888606	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.494446583127	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.505607052517	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.505458119326	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.502531032153	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
1.0	0.503518993633	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.496616833159	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.55097921864	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
1.0	0.511989273586	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.511384715929	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.540343594899	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.35074396605	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.493559659679	It was.
0.0	0.49902701072	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.489187081168	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.497900695333	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.52396048384	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.498656249037	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.501588877227	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.472109645685	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.50163675033	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.504747012304	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.502788312292	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.489073900812	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.486833008405	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.497891464657	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.495446615532	I never said that.
0.0	0.507475886934	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.491102513818	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.496736670948	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.488370673918	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.469332657292	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.498521765839	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.497582349674	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.492748839303	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.494625602479	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.489225371148	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.498027738651	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.524790848976	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.496334630911	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.497779621361	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.488037609984	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.521789654557	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.498396450816	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.49791563319	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.497515290313	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.494192406909	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.496467603935	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.473188495486	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.503441018385	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.487606007552	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.487438167193	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.497336069717	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.509036876117	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.495868505703	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.438072861184	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.466107484832	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.495275121481	Take it to the bank.
1.0	0.503428835718	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.501232456531	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.520915326092	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.49371542801	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.494616677385	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.506869377027	When I was 21, my mom died.
1.0	0.506248522451	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.508326610051	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.49740082696	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.502687781879	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.494161317443	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.494349593782	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.488247812158	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.496993082607	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.494025233063	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.442444677387	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.489697580105	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.496530611708	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.505952653483	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.517222469755	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.546570069138	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.508381049069	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.508820541993	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.489475851493	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.493638038992	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.440681557889	But...
0.0	0.499563484629	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.513844621956	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.426206902154	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.502587715924	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.491867490997	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.489124387717	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.509333442404	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.493949507711	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.49134884724	Why is that?
0.0	0.489918435078	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.495213110032	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.493307580988	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.490834940374	We have no borders.
0.0	0.491976853653	We are not France.
0.0	0.494645064141	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.51075208747	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.496470898857	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.498858890493	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.502033853154	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.496559523791	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.48707897104	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.4968219322	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.468260749107	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.500137434806	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.503119721674	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.484631518362	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.501998273005	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.483186385789	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.533456248386	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.483225935561	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.49586406928	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.494642053595	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.495793031686	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.39869658121	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.497795112935	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.503003121428	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.49164031929	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.490623714806	Think about that.
0.0	0.578675335162	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.484947180909	I think if it doesn't...
1.0	0.512262023695	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.494222803792	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.491861571581	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.495886822692	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.501378310091	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.490170426636	I can't do it.
0.0	0.494619948732	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.500991129867	Two points.
0.0	0.495624550554	to save a company.
0.0	0.494855745297	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.385890590735	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.493685977719	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.500014744931	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.494081028327	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.497537119636	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.493089088066	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.500340331219	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.494388331292	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.495168428715	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.502205881118	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.501365065335	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.501352898821	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.495611640147	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.468325895644	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.444112721264	No.
0.0	0.486803815902	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.444449255627	Absolutely.
0.0	0.486358437423	But look...
0.0	0.499565218191	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.486770436586	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.510062969704	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.500030553362	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.382615907247	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.506401405168	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.495433709905	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.501903357001	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.488861559279	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.495926426575	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.502524703771	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.494129838707	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.491501103886	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.503450358586	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.509994361891	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.500228292179	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.499708393539	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.497836440405	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.495377243732	That's fine.
0.0	0.497972776819	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.448386045906	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.495578526569	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.495294374078	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.511857102987	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.42117361928	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.500628477823	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.489777402195	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.491191353193	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.504381187844	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.506047458016	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.491863097859	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.503103599319	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.493650820818	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.498879189927	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.496958192934	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.394046415145	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.49005522419	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.496729243795	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.491957838989	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.495421413298	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.374836005113	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.496102556431	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.511545070857	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
1.0	0.491333637731	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.502544374351	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.496855787985	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.483360871845	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.49563941238	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.545891452026	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.502051203963	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.500562543811	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.488890537728	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.502179393274	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.493985985346	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.500981393115	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.493396773579	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.495584666611	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.496668910115	He's wrong.
0.0	0.388969253763	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.483609610829	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.499923253243	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.490090396578	You do.
0.0	0.498207358611	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.498554559994	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.486758254209	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.506620602564	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.493864029315	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.4983911241	Both served.
0.0	0.487050988079	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.498824208473	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.495903557812	What have you got now?
0.0	0.507708009462	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.499471081066	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.49763160599	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.495324102476	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.508105851332	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.492932291043	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.492862315305	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.496254471442	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.406087789915	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.499525643657	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.495064042841	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.49149140547	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.367241751604	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.497371651388	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.494599196313	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.504634798937	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.559465394622	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.488471040451	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.497248984586	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.486249075818	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.501389751559	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.499127102821	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.495046431489	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.488610313211	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.490879903034	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.502320442591	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.490512136553	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.491728376613	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.395034969899	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.396363882946	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.431230272625	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.491574305856	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.489024216216	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.52316237406	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.496566502998	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.492634839992	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
1.0	0.499637702797	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.518182047609	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.412725850458	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.478627158387	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
1.0	0.496705426625	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.488586804577	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.529170945901	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.501485523088	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.496140863195	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.498968666099	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
1.0	0.50145370781	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.495067168463	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.490616872358	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.495428797355	That's what I said.
0.0	0.489185064793	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.407037105802	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.495171112872	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.501093116733	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
1.0	0.512427652149	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.496978175538	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.488858661842	Well, I've been --

0.0	0.498451787175	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.506635801829	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.483738354542	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.493043068548	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.500188064694	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.495580711267	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.4995736738	I didn't inherit any money.
1.0	0.50320517434	They were wrong.
0.0	0.506136425344	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.491458764675	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.520646531106	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.494969968091	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.49327622481	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.498954168986	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.491498004489	That's right.
0.0	0.496587964766	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.51852282111	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.497613559658	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.493870142749	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.493807129934	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.492333090658	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.444112721264	No.
0.0	0.49920378778	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.503309859479	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.500831960582	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.499167284466	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.513292388085	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.481551866072	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
1.0	0.550383941558	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.503333807421	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.490010373019	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.490623714806	Think about it.
0.0	0.493378472396	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.514395156796	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.495408236073	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.496549860756	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.503491550075	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.499780505303	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.503458081559	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.

0.0	0.501035166497	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.495255687847	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.477507095905	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.499385903345	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.492426198999	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.504165501326	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.504104256792	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.493576205169	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.494615089915	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.507133619399	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.499448594112	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.497923040149	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.491414850961	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.496765364029	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.511733530773	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.498076379279	I'm prepared.

0.0	0.444112721264	No.
0.0	0.492911094352	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.496144422863	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.444112721264	No.
0.0	0.493297896361	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.444112721264	Alright.
0.0	0.497141249329	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.495875622591	You don't know it, they tax us.

0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.496747548116	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.496555763077	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.48548494747	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.488266728989	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.517091280922	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.488864625862	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.503128349084	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.497036700468	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.495603292364	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.498738962362	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.491976853653	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.505016837056	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.498712170121	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.478111388844	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.504014458349	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.506752195888	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.486507159369	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.506443741141	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.505073006903	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.491812984007	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.492730104654	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.494602749667	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.356295145159	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.497932240275	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.492847016338	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.505879986632	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.49709192809	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
1.0	0.515682314964	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.497071004944	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.495479957111	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.496673596606	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.487485334032	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.49525111909	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.485943696136	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.499183452147	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.441577924723	So...
0.0	0.501522391821	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.509290585978	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.50295594647	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.506998780244	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.504755294951	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.506951637425	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.387051795326	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.491241659253	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.490346177578	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.494479825084	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.498415665602	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.463505057508	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.49149837052	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
1.0	0.514237882418	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.499845504436	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.502482028228	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.489053401162	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.493228278061	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.488669948679	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.48603756324	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.506601191114	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.495220196086	So what if mass unemployment exists?
1.0	0.494673942441	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.441241509759	...
0.0	0.48945014799	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
1.0	0.512009215401	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.507844163481	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.496050732483	Good at email.
0.0	0.491471055982	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.493885074442	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.406049965781	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.557875684286	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.493193128197	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.511612413848	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.492038405741	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.496525132911	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.50484389716	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.500782150229	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.491102513818	You don't have to.
0.0	0.500566556501	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.491883821399	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.494585737368	This will end.
0.0	0.501569170975	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.506458503593	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.494585737368	I would change them.
0.0	0.494713665058	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.507601194914	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.493721610113	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.49706685626	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.49153796497	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.490739916078	That's for sure.
0.0	0.493763751901	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.496670448963	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.51127052948	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.53549402581	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.497598529387	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.48911070562	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.505802817796	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.495710627604	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.493545069547	You bet they do.
0.0	0.494179616441	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.513909490332	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.544481077096	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.521960343649	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.501537093048	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.507463321217	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.496399097158	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.496077514334	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.366249293153	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.495069783258	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.506072027924	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.49626517571	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.495406458757	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.498606078766	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.498468717165	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.49364590212	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.500233148852	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.49164031929	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.491784027917	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.391520957694	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.496995035564	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.490667423096	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.492748637721	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.49957838734	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.499179756109	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.495696107409	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.49734110571	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.501748162403	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.490720554014	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.495452880907	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.491599334402	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
1.0	0.500150123412	Very few children.
0.0	0.490491241872	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.506967810743	But let me say one more thing.
1.0	0.517993556572	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.495131275155	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.363175995052	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.494710453404	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.496049839507	I'm very proud.
1.0	0.495261466205	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.503540514858	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.489303668989	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.500452048118	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.616771695382	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.502771611671	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.496339625065	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.495055521749	That's my bill.
0.0	0.40674569176	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.545043256804	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.50977892799	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.506159486054	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.503986997522	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.496737453807	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.550296928512	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.504652743758	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.475105598997	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.494196672409	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.498324297999	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.496597476349	He has never defended...
0.0	0.494882862681	(inaudible).
0.0	0.391527196666	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.524952025036	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.498489125258	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.502834352124	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.501133746221	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.499537268603	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.500653766461	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
1.0	0.500386164399	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.419998098883	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.496010358089	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.505815026507	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.490623714806	Check it out.
0.0	0.493425378659	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.500519385322	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.48789348366	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.477158163114	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.496616668545	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.493745886705	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.441241509759	...
0.0	0.496526554145	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.524423790749	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.491823601435	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.49887288991	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.389270472391	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.494112824657	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.492223113768	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.501483026706	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.498969755779	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.481375964317	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.490987324609	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.499212851775	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.479815486111	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.443982875445	Why?
0.0	0.512328720762	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.505389163521	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.498160572077	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.505377161303	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.514369277167	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.491834538852	It goes away.
0.0	0.366313441019	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.509007989575	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.498619932047	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.494224693143	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.494283956985	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.493260607724	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.500900411385	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.500199473276	You opposed him then.
1.0	0.491326433454	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.489923314749	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.501611241994	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.482767489013	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.492147847231	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
1.0	0.510623482916	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.49751664994	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.494396939567	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.35723588803	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.499385541296	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.497634692529	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.356024905659	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.491843012852	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.49831704389	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
1.0	0.50934513718	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.494261430486	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.504105376101	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.497974705633	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.49284903923	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.495863365164	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.501892042211	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.50491683715	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.49272631527	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.521908663426	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.510173325573	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.499072308827	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.444112721264	No.
0.0	0.489447260919	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.362695077957	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.493173272571	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.493620204566	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.485779794496	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.498767581051	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.488219981701	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.501677375587	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.508386824303	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.499542655228	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.481108855824	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.497052718375	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.499675842628	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.497729103759	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.269414464316	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.496502924242	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.492252028117	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.47626776164	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.502516973361	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.504409025825	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.49362043364	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.49350711562	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.491365531555	You know why?
0.0	0.49645122964	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.50493724958	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.483536878201	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.499004087803	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.443266985338	See?
0.0	0.497802712212	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.498320161868	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.519986353701	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.507926497034	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.499618301191	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.494296303907	No, you did.
0.0	0.516587175189	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.494842127007	I promise.
0.0	0.497894711826	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.490113948254	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.488698311226	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.494595571638	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.489518929476	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.505509493371	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.498821332856	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.494772435353	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.406560354471	The answer is no.
0.0	0.49402927954	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.520262326766	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.502506735113	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.503062995534	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.488325999483	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.51905968503	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.405149839727	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.502664369965	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.511659988064	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.357758289835	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.500843546809	He hit oil.
0.0	0.505234445086	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.501346765463	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.509006763145	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.514726380851	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.503542521304	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.502702529492	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.507671194609	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.49660412433	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.508408270753	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.503513151058	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.564295625289	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.553888012095	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.357459784955	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.555184532892	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.495754046189	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.506090878198	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.494237461379	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.455411979034	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.503696179298	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.443497408305	Illegal.
0.0	0.49746191424	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.496107464823	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
1.0	0.551134160514	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.510769563305	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.497811694827	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.506515237588	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.522626842671	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.496669670388	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.508413365287	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.509408481927	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.490469007116	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.498090346708	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.499835149497	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.48299335199	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.495262699837	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.503277660321	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.490327769292	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.504414197817	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.487862118859	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.505271515316	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.487983088545	The number of women --
0.0	0.434629436433	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.498597186321	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.491544650628	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
1.0	0.642462378285	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.496079267793	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.488680927059	And guess what?
1.0	0.504351037781	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.495198280282	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.514485367691	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.492263366293	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.500513827702	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.490386830391	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.358194744995	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.495320510099	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.496160226252	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.493021330199	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.503119646162	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.504190491211	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.500845830355	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.51876040082	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.491373043249	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.494091784994	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.488282205087	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.499300004783	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.50354934907	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.499960158692	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.486679990777	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.49028185078	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.495239447907	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.502278361531	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.4814751986	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.499779097759	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.491885291435	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.549972690188	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.496920745873	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.47659958682	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.483015817795	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.500695544124	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.502311440601	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.500818092482	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.502887399339	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.501580792898	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.489035353556	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.492758189589	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.405901250201	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.495956272179	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.498475610944	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.490529386786	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.503492894342	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.488462364379	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.495443428341	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.499184395845	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.482653203416	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.495727388856	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.395219185317	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.492502935636	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.495148271053	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.496509122141	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.499635432438	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.498892190242	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.48905573241	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.489315623851	in particular.
0.0	0.497082700871	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.508695540093	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.484337092787	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.495446615532	I never said that.
0.0	0.496420706254	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.49201465353	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.493982978516	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.518362229222	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.504386383709	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.491283909641	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.496486245737	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.508173458617	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.497162248662	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.504922644914	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.492772134514	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.490513523313	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.503739187679	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.503075631215	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.510356887357	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.488431817817	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.498556756527	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.519054464554	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.495966340208	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.354995019875	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.521749928298	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.487549234965	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.476955076758	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.50361093245	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.49474462047	That is important.
0.0	0.500905909143	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.484949474366	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.511792135383	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.44367015281	Yeah.
0.0	0.498164852016	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.489975647486	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.496256477217	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.496663486506	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.501412655214	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.496977806476	We will work with our Sunni allies.
1.0	0.543558339443	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.500861909782	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.495446615532	I never said that.
0.0	0.495154117571	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.496409350308	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.503701977256	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.484779045793	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.496835253137	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.494323324279	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.489406275433	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.490177811788	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.47941918141	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.490647858891	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.502724839256	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.492642771044	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.499371337635	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.511530051581	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.49442408923	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.502209633624	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.500135551521	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
1.0	0.515801239748	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.367824256611	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.494592236287	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.491503493705	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.49899613953	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.497276429283	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.496027275651	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.480845246226	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.4977542577	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.496650894175	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.467013212942	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.498113731594	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.496799222377	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.516069349516	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
1.0	0.503493819106	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.507952823673	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.508814242429	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.487173486886	I would just say that...
0.0	0.559303547891	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.358330609689	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.486972610598	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.507650448056	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.509196301001	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.499474391269	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.496852013723	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.539251237298	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.496294144155	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.504150346169	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.491429319531	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.495513090496	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.485015648363	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.536205452839	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.506325804016	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.507032361826	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.495049664884	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.497048531585	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.507574794398	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.493850021344	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.495446615532	I never said that.
0.0	0.50014832472	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.497322389588	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.491365531555	You know why?
0.0	0.397521219613	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.489312044605	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.53577408365	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
1.0	0.504277773278	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.393722222349	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.495332872407	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.490257110362	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.500627368358	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.501893290357	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.503360797411	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.436188682803	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.505769175691	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.492459012959	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.502115621376	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.500881382421	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.494887475709	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.357221323214	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.475472061821	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.510453241425	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.480088508948	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.501360449482	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.496899834519	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.494726896133	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.409960311606	I was the architect.
0.0	0.482439751362	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.500162741712	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.4920755141	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.495796174022	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.492577111732	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.497387459155	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.491383070562	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.4965202959	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.495126478991	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.49057347477	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.391843027084	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.505772274661	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.490882516862	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.470809752819	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.393387856461	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.49331716564	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.496412108121	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.490090396578	I do.
0.0	0.498284701431	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.498776134037	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.354045474486	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.492358075413	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.494632869365	Well, I did.
0.0	0.507691052609	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.359097975367	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.503538771237	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.512092633696	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.502254375403	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.496917039708	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.548065511608	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.40770065447	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.487884166181	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.500807453659	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.495446615532	I was not at all.
0.0	0.492667281973	We have to obey the laws.
1.0	0.446051062382	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.444112721264	John.
0.0	0.496604364637	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.498232514823	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.496029167915	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.472979467858	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.503881854324	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.49241387688	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.497929533846	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.444112721264	No.
0.0	0.492602102705	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.498797216937	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.494712222613	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.506751224288	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.495106822437	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.391882771749	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.493273990238	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.506121299113	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.510812825209	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.501908870983	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.48712808204	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.505065418078	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.489594121704	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.493672408971	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.493630603886	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.514826713704	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.40334396116	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.523572679507	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
1.0	0.499554383429	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.46324476718	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.49406968752	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.497208638587	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.557715573009	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.49766884049	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.492590772856	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.390282727109	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.500339894154	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.441241509759	...
0.0	0.488226430422	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.498058565306	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.492224738334	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.398677280754	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.393060931717	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.500039931902	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
1.0	0.644036263053	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.490614520924	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.491520214198	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.499108291754	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.497028053935	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.355775682879	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.495205108568	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.497299875049	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.500769564802	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.487830565167	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.3783852533	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.49463935335	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.493559659679	You did.
0.0	0.487873458347	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.490090396578	We do.
0.0	0.492636627076	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.507196879796	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.498839241351	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
1.0	0.599435393856	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.502147312646	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.50413881217	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.500540997255	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.505704319337	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
1.0	0.493669722138	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.498254788449	And you know what?
0.0	0.444449255627	Right.
0.0	0.495726613782	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.498262909967	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.501225355862	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.495051632762	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.499171875792	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.491486757587	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.490872809415	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.499075582229	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
1.0	0.501907945976	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.493271562008	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.508676004609	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.492149114218	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.469903154469	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.479875524726	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.504205542647	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.507949317939	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.502791327889	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.495291471791	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.467061368702	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.4942020572	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.486136703606	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.48864520938	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.501627455272	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.550706271197	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.485221316149	...John...
0.0	0.497193425083	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.362594578723	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.490840102542	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.541237904578	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.498593670767	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.498056136149	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.497568983358	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.491853677542	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.506476033256	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.499108286624	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.49829408798	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.497741279162	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.523822744113	Of course not.
0.0	0.498361267829	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.495097109657	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.509981559543	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.497834515202	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.496604694112	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.395482809972	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.494655346519	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.497010349286	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.364847227495	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.496901854586	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.489577638116	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.483955129823	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.494948042844	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.481132593361	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.508299751033	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.509512182499	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.514737146127	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.489037244007	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.500563996338	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.484890208683	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.492704326687	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.498632299709	You know why three?
0.0	0.55423674741	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.494702950247	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.49969794955	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.508693708762	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.513183293585	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.488719718528	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.492139074916	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.474130066592	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.488480676341	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.492227413257	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.496139345817	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.50118117985	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.490299554273	Wait for what?
0.0	0.44367015281	Okay.
0.0	0.492108708014	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
1.0	0.504103052224	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.494287384046	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.497908076636	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
1.0	0.505899562532	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.500642724932	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.48685714829	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.397209630638	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.493081835522	I will stand firm.
1.0	0.500851989562	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.495172210116	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.509456715411	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
1.0	0.49191480052	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.499813362494	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.494713907114	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.505460383101	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.495169329864	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.520444390979	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.498835259569	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.498202679431	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.491459152128	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.489073900812	Thank you.
0.0	0.491296793492	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.496248616913	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.505307892451	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.498062547519	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
1.0	0.497943209791	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.504497194066	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.49860386709	The world has changed.
0.0	0.515038994299	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.486257604391	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.506048751376	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.495595835316	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.497276429283	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.495949606443	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.492000975007	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.483656161022	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.493977795033	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.498303733992	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.55836693925	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.481125439316	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.488077538911	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.495377243732	That's the difference.
0.0	0.491008902424	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.54696809982	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.447641474239	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.495215410521	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.500932149838	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.494163085392	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.50029867819	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.506543370534	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.483050276584	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.491880849274	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.444449255627	Right.
0.0	0.500221212889	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.493656555705	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.495348307015	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.487990637291	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.492337564219	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.499455660624	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.499604343734	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.502491077	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.488610002745	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.49814497469	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.509753250171	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.493403747935	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.492045237652	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.494964206696	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.49861812415	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.495266446731	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.508349503082	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.553740433836	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.490514277536	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.492845466182	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.491833488891	We need sound money.
0.0	0.494357404389	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.497053202175	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.489473312231	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.506782287866	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.481935495354	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.495398231975	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.51174833324	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.517357546121	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.498779011318	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.354837834999	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.492833119272	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.51922466036	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.511279454604	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.50623020695	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.495163586178	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
1.0	0.503667135844	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.497281226268	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.49724101975	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.494954475196	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.504490480461	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.498902472567	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.493980217435	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.353901378864	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
1.0	0.582202196754	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.489833942425	You can have him.
0.0	0.488782903929	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.48842768047	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.498496939415	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.353560638428	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.507416494556	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.495932236586	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.504496117978	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.495222768547	He is a good man.
0.0	0.501320604385	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.50695716768	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.492875607998	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.399658905091	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.490090396578	I have.
0.0	0.405284599204	We'll just clean it up.
1.0	0.505214204972	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.494610718837	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.498734985165	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.500305895005	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.500193987501	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.481028609606	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
1.0	0.495254161565	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.505284667007	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.5034987835	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.493600527908	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.502192534917	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.495410637548	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.499929268178	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.50909436492	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.497040381293	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.491833488891	We need sound money.
0.0	0.487584024675	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.397215710606	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.489303668989	...Thank you.
0.0	0.500402547844	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.489607492934	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.497650542272	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.503012224377	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.495377023566	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.497116541822	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.511935962404	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.493936464625	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.493263560398	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.500647924902	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.492450553574	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.497155553794	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
1.0	0.52944067169	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.406590216258	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.495232145614	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.49597634477	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.492904979597	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.501635913159	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.489465079811	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
1.0	0.50453272746	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.501706618882	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.501904291377	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.502433814374	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.493623469738	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.500506847871	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.499120869217	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.489598471201	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.501640358768	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.49643931747	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.485861866425	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.502073950137	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.498946710179	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.496995142298	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.48879739161	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.532543728207	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.495232640453	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.497406684365	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.486252697472	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.492091271293	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.499471078959	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.501414756551	There's a big question mark on your head.
1.0	0.649103595341	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.500540564891	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.491984242562	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.512302484794	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.40949706963	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.383669056338	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.491044021051	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.498606129244	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.502216522207	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.487491928679	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.503710639498	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.485027170627	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.495214332011	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.444112721264	No.
0.0	0.353382180882	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.499946339803	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.498306128721	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.491273847241	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.489706246941	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.491044113128	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.499377048216	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.500785978185	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.487682751335	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.500929947538	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.551398914163	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.494258595295	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.504630688282	This isn't the governments money.

0.0	0.409400776215	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.493745779548	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.

0.0	0.507541963285	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.492019037754	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.494954605937	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.494024429933	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.493694337637	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.489509781892	What should we do?
0.0	0.498415665602	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.492135921624	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.488123402808	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.491171309643	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.533938961113	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.511577768349	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.495533659438	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.489933047609	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.497625175117	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.487533302701	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.496556239408	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.48785514017	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
1.0	0.523087520581	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.486644889016	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.502051418806	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.530218348215	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.491909834725	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.506617065453	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.494956545662	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.497106888622	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.489948081776	It is.
0.0	0.510215874923	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.495619548281	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.49682430556	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.537406159824	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.498978622432	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.494545286723	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.515310237558	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.48654551555	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.507300791207	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.488791257915	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.489668275053	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.40687125709	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.49750005039	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.485221316149	...Chris...
0.0	0.48459682028	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.495801488297	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.512812338494	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.49816739581	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.507184954746	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.44367015281	Yes.
0.0	0.369100385263	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.502518736135	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.495517728606	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.49711471122	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.492569595604	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.494427586623	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.507210103592	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.411239038408	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.400123610081	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.488493588036	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.494152103306	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.491071093229	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.503355450238	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.492228865886	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.51121947763	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.437221626642	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.487557083335	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.498201570841	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.394688972275	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.504989775985	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.497951210303	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.496525892567	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.499772161199	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.495773714419	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.497841465461	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.568997828144	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.520474931626	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.504540227507	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.520389701971	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.492261024704	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.498247834001	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.498847880099	So you know what?
0.0	0.497209559728	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.501007302244	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.489556945533	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.498360084837	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.498262291659	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.493529132716	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.496370950442	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.495088162351	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.501298057731	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.506854888158	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.494324515038	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.395564013444	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.499505392753	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.491780612465	Big difference.
0.0	0.584262505191	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.489930746208	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.494216311688	Let's talk about our campaigns.
1.0	0.489997564565	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.495460263628	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.494912080238	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.522607838019	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.478455017417	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.492962778089	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.498570208799	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.499008275332	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.503244785809	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.399122218871	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.496665854447	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.501476832756	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.377023300664	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.486865618976	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.351112006857	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.493577777916	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.493541076014	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.496354975872	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.490491241872	How do I know this?
0.0	0.496550884448	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.499340177161	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.493550228982	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.467389396818	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
1.0	0.496785701073	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.497198043249	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.50391996731	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.513428590966	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.356062336214	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.500324415722	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.496819681871	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.503933608099	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.494458198155	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.498453602883	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.487328975267	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.505809132488	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.50366370469	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.487008446452	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.505609140175	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.49606871448	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.496974973665	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.499085833044	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.486604138345	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.354150306667	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.502465872806	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.490928568126	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.486537934702	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.500677006638	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.506902970859	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.49557091707	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.507676977594	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.490389962706	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.492979525426	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.395472310686	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.501908445233	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.44367015281	OK?
0.0	0.498992545145	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.484203011469	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.552418064811	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.488702694164	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.500123343731	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.496019293247	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.498167906971	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.502994044569	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.495917868353	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.498552260785	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.510041752925	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.495563125891	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.495310639486	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.487591083624	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.571559313183	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.492247586621	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.534725693127	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.499829430605	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.488383794394	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.487619244059	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.491631026156	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.503198570678	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.499598300864	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.511950117195	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.495049819653	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.494408297622	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.484887488807	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.49530565153	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.489846241399	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.491173789324	That's what he is.
0.0	0.496085951094	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.497157326095	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.490384069841	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.501778249875	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.468675380747	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.497196498291	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.496234343867	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.486609718554	I'm happy to have him tonight...
1.0	0.495178902574	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.505540952984	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.499951556287	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.5081151424	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.

0.0	0.495156332286	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.491858265356	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.499796493575	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.496620290604	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.501566949165	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.505924821423	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.

0.0	0.476867481536	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.492454711731	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.498439118154	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.498235606447	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.354892332331	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.488725052593	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.488725052593	I'll say this.

0.0	0.488483933794	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.499181849009	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.495343947295	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.

0.0	0.508378920419	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.

0.0	0.499499681019	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.502709549076	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.49480750941	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.

0.0	0.495377243732	That's fine.
