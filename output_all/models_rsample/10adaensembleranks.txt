0.0	0.491596875058	That's not right.
0.0	0.491699660924	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.492126552146	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.397966747102	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.492833331391	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.493411329594	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.504374800858	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.5339999459	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.513489693175	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.51184529999	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.493098599076	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.494202610147	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.498715794479	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.500930304096	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.497277886264	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.50732409617	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.377542186819	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.497840858684	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.509346391901	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.490094062749	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.415241280189	...
0.0	0.495422915493	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.490930847163	I promise.
0.0	0.4183373347	John.
0.0	0.494335690069	So what if mass unemployment exists?
1.0	0.544848600879	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.492841854669	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.485705550158	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.493709161258	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.5109379285	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.490897045756	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.497051163415	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.500513529797	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.489451803379	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.508139369256	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.406107327452	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.485602145246	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.493679413537	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.483897058365	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.498865174712	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.494204156289	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.512921233003	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.494370572436	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.492932851012	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.495816577423	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.490181356863	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.492840099592	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.51503827409	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.494991531423	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.496342439417	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.49381305404	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.488510177599	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.488554485518	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.506214726518	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.507096650185	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.495268342428	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.493683412288	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.49159996316	Check it out.
0.0	0.493004837613	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.509169874561	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.491983143813	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.382542040273	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.499199452144	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.514115265681	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
1.0	0.520339459381	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.493818700913	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.497272250192	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.494824725738	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.506499466891	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.503520092911	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.499821123164	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.490779410971	You can have him.
0.0	0.498137006126	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.499793522378	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.499319285324	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.486125747598	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.50239560243	Of course not.
0.0	0.491263137521	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.415241280189	Maria...
0.0	0.482842706134	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.489021365325	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.381437185081	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.496160007411	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.497661818223	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.491005217638	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.498201797402	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.502008797075	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.497132027681	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.4183373347	No.
0.0	0.415241280189	So...
0.0	0.49862528866	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.534685642929	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.441217728026	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.369350417574	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.495276043011	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.485483071201	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.489214940595	He undermines it.
0.0	0.504630796159	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.482746122546	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.355289379533	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.489984254155	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.497300499858	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.499013177706	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
1.0	0.511268550386	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.496570510464	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.490837581802	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.493212639888	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.501447135395	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.496526494503	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.498593967052	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.497385929133	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.
0.0	0.4015553424	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.499352584608	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.397928671347	It feels different.
0.0	0.510255322491	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.498848658465	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.489696460781	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.50550538865	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
1.0	0.507390684675	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.495758265552	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.493094035181	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.496289203865	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.497780569797	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.491168102027	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.497113874258	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.495683630834	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.518766717849	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.498189607193	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.490849316174	You did.
0.0	0.492070688304	That's right.
0.0	0.503116479205	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.507949596991	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.494281418635	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.490779410971	I can't do it.
0.0	0.357897557941	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.483739133645	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.4183373347	Yes.
0.0	0.501042766926	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.495667796711	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.495919024974	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.491888370433	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.494957034128	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.499827093354	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.493797385461	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.499226080441	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.51526203449	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.497775587524	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.504716487511	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.491306990028	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.486634902253	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.516965881884	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.50217331795	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.494346893301	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.496366133793	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.
0.0	0.494323914729	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.491941669204	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.49975516286	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.496366133793	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.497147178792	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.506299982978	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.497783660976	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.4183373347	No.
0.0	0.504836618031	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.500081162007	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.491976950715	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.493269170254	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.492080565857	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.503686299924	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.480265462638	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.505474402557	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
1.0	0.495371371521	That's wrong.
0.0	0.501846050469	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.491625682893	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.495454710413	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.492559014992	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.495593431607	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.498770774291	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.482711229187	...John...
0.0	0.494797841596	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.496615940674	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.486216116029	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.493986356118	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.504547955651	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.49636756472	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.497537546526	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.499548472971	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.490013918179	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.497320840268	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.498904704392	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.490015858648	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.489988831124	What should we do?
1.0	0.506897079828	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.496562119586	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.511160933529	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.498934187076	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.502235817162	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.503544149793	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.504632406441	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.493511660299	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.495023491996	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.503817942361	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.506383422153	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.502896291781	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.503619288402	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.526995103536	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.499903082738	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.506757858697	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.492856800903	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.490434799014	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.500085639901	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.498043177337	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.498413453513	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.317762138266	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.527540592493	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.50537674487	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.500294684982	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.492708820975	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.537729371232	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.490582160521	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.501416112807	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.494317675106	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.506091783126	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.491528376087	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.529614803222	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.502834779759	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.506634268094	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.493333900537	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.507050829403	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.499657817211	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.498335061214	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.395705049131	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.486398543135	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.494490480688	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.508578217686	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.492894210396	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.497089405029	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.499494390292	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.49623226886	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.499582769125	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.499928415346	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.4183373347	Why?
0.0	0.520369698159	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.49200195178	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.493806685169	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.506614619348	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.492991917014	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.506024060736	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.495641161147	No, you did.
0.0	0.500947433255	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.488515992645	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.497298336631	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.507793145766	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.49798763776	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.494100797398	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.496995027543	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.492237352366	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.497745901058	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.495955450793	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.486865097281	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.482331649613	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.497707208462	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.402599780629	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.495328181577	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.494499350893	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
1.0	0.516338401854	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.494346148913	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.494859741784	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.495818767832	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.498013507523	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.498511518945	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.484938552877	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.497433131964	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.496764024147	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.493939745581	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.487767794694	I would just say that...
0.0	0.504664650359	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.396041955077	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.429803154601	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.496197704048	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.556368041339	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.396649375232	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.492994394043	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.495102797547	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.500031959396	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.530443098448	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.492237352366	We are not France.
0.0	0.497089439706	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.415241280189	These...
0.0	0.493502993065	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.43466571932	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.509564016367	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.491506309319	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.39551370856	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.506435702695	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.463505242329	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.492595170371	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.520032431815	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.537738161089	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.492662104535	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.497036797482	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.523636465359	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.495019627507	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
1.0	0.506283702088	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.500564392808	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.505536460708	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.529614803222	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.553640119177	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.490801035541	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.493061837875	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.503279363698	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.504834198961	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.495005448216	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.496005226517	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.491727655057	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.492070688304	Why is that?
0.0	0.356509846984	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.497353532644	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.503780611545	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.487840348103	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.509092144784	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.498075743398	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.501094657127	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.496323716299	No vision at all.
0.0	0.499878994576	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.504778843294	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.497389372546	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.494578631597	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.514292431283	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.581076976371	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.500785335668	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.49125946391	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.516691907184	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.500889101959	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.505160618517	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.509613867756	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.499377239441	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.549392767061	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.492997552582	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.365424168867	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.518470972417	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.49500591714	My point is this.
0.0	0.492996507262	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.502390720142	We bailed them out.
1.0	0.598662589688	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.497049029075	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.490373311817	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.48803310071	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.517494604743	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.499256256264	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.357004766843	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.499042466551	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.496165152383	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.496722126234	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.49721848707	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.468010544539	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.491842568955	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.495575154689	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.489598296063	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.498805551406	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.501170769023	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.511041299205	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.499021868216	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.485868722107	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.49622479441	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.494398116775	That's my bill.
0.0	0.493018532771	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.510704032312	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.496825975032	They're a scam.
0.0	0.494208776219	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.490316528275	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.499040246534	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.51546621439	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.494877007858	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.493954195071	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.492649698642	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.495238761423	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.487002180632	I do.
0.0	0.489543906845	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.499927916918	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.503332317743	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.493263972478	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.502658741603	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.492459763212	We need sound money.
0.0	0.492073501889	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.488405240338	It's true.
0.0	0.492299499941	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.496954800367	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.488124022242	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.508906754714	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.50658906627	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.511699399957	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.491299093044	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.499717983358	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.4183373347	No.
0.0	0.405370270953	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.500303529988	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.50570027891	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.49965125641	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.493205015231	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.480021338498	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.513858917473	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.

0.0	0.494678238215	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.498832000501	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.494576374555	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.488084299486	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.498956976925	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.491837311573	I love China.
0.0	0.498080495196	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.484614790926	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.486401999435	You just want to...
0.0	0.519912940392	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.499484449886	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.354100668943	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.494589613721	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.491059197711	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.500034203482	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.495184480359	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.403004951256	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.4921541285	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.500330749473	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.388839620795	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.521848237199	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.482441500903	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.494873155599	Nobody can solve it like me.
1.0	0.616027533473	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.504718202543	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.483371478437	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.472613027155	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.504062656632	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.497037669394	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.497563765374	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.501573593924	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.490360237996	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.552483946947	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.495905003449	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.490624524044	I can do that.
0.0	0.496901001186	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.502061274805	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.499365278084	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.497229787009	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.496001316033	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.48394902496	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.494257512266	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.495028381815	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.498936933649	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.502571552823	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.488849278431	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.497674466386	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.498275243461	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.50096791889	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.499545511317	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.50507691499	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.529738919643	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.494239843331	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.509708445555	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.502703349046	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.496955708048	She said the truth.
0.0	0.499351926118	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.50451504188	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.495031248417	And, we said no.
0.0	0.489252482225	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.496486242644	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.498979120309	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.501017715941	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.491292988043	Well, sure.
0.0	0.493442765786	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.495545613671	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.493369723396	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.495638394753	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.524305348335	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.499215180628	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
1.0	0.497816272217	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.530744523792	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.497089877558	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.491129981946	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.509012095999	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.488624042455	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.489060091812	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.521734402256	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.497005330647	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.490697419169	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.525509025311	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.497382801514	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.373594454785	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.495417476681	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.497379743948	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.485936795878	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.488459386217	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.492781578798	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.482711229187	...Chris...
0.0	0.495356448844	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.491033906565	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.4183373347	Alright.
0.0	0.397157170306	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.493959171081	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.508540401531	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
1.0	0.51918404648	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.368934781843	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.50798960352	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.496099830744	He has never defended...
0.0	0.494673510595	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.49727441445	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.502858413045	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
1.0	0.500336923867	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.368232019869	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.494554288072	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.494919571738	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.497541308773	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.4980711029	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.379727574082	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.493678273853	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.516147614932	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.540737626779	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.501414816251	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.492204685218	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.490808289015	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.493363807001	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.503688160604	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.485264655559	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
1.0	0.495807597947	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.371959674956	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.498936853067	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.531811095974	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.489742467474	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.49534270113	He is a good man.
0.0	0.402884730759	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.493182037271	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.496077470174	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.521125734095	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.498550931724	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.495172621743	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.496916524682	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.490181128868	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.491350804885	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.487328708282	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.397996240376	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.504931113553	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.496545632323	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.504846705248	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.492557141972	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.498119269463	And you know what?
0.0	0.450172421034	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.499592549662	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.495617517049	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.489221320884	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.496799135391	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.498287700263	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.501341230813	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.490148263443	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.495081323785	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.511871924852	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.490557548963	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.494760955142	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.499920668951	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.527239916302	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.497564544034	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.48604059356	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.56095581826	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.380757899202	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.379691523962	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.525977431615	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.502217095932	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.495393468437	That's fine.
0.0	0.493923825434	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.511178484407	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.530241771184	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.493987388076	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.494523844114	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.499289939516	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.499832621118	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.373105130841	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.495057394795	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.512674984352	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.488573099708	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.495286916665	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.492980453689	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.415241280189	Again...
0.0	0.490148576998	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.489891203325	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.502496329122	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.489686806552	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.395589901404	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.494280706132	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.494289619569	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.493924235251	My background is different.
0.0	0.483620377034	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.501624991473	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.381125256511	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.496203071743	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.506623077181	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.49005525832	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.497823428792	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.50679166051	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.497404591586	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.491233367089	...before I go.
0.0	0.497675960729	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.471277148667	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.495144957536	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.488383958753	We don't need that.
0.0	0.514633039515	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.494569949339	But let's not kid ourselves.

0.0	0.493738999994	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.495260588943	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.505101084204	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.

0.0	0.396202519337	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.492148132618	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.489527091208	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.

0.0	0.49781654535	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
1.0	0.510040680426	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.521395057221	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.487500385763	And guess what?
0.0	0.49552793517	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.493942849465	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.494933111003	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.507496137257	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.49975516286	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.492237352366	We haven't.
0.0	0.490624524044	I'll say this.
0.0	0.499432745187	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.498339091395	Two points.
0.0	0.503637023835	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.496377325145	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.497315247534	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.500036521369	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.498942381821	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.494135271469	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.494930236926	I'm looking out for the American worker.

0.0	0.491154983689	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.531045207196	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.491052042237	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.495615672665	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.490612636463	Big difference.
0.0	0.498342847266	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.442928355831	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.531645175822	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.495172621743	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.49834922473	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.502615690929	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.397772560008	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.502111505525	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.504523264028	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.491107256827	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.496510296137	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.49692996958	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.492049210246	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.49337784989	In addition to that...
0.0	0.494916504704	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.492020164063	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.490536470332	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.499958377245	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.497776441074	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.497895585942	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.492925056132	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.502311714547	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.487938612776	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.
0.0	0.492766246273	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.494091867956	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.485105161293	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.499699661069	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.494447451098	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.495582473189	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.49758648054	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.492039601465	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.490405820553	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.505055905679	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.492070688304	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.497374856946	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.510034877284	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.493469824396	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.491146753482	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.498484086273	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.498139627605	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.485875485376	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.492693266103	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.496168341948	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.504563168361	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.511444542026	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.487002180632	You do.
0.0	0.494271868316	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.500939221485	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.493791091865	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.499508251677	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.496970613623	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.526058842227	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.491254060581	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.494057720168	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.502985966196	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.49561919387	And for good cause.
0.0	0.491444313389	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.486772275571	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.491718744634	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.502792850639	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.497457953604	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.500692282609	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.465540576023	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.504951646193	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.504450118865	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.498468500534	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.455411797623	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.48671588588	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.492919943736	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.496615940674	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.49574298521	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.501246790205	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.497158303562	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.49345363278	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.503071895826	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.498645563385	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.489913716746	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.502935022913	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.498630889511	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.512624535067	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.539739395172	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.452063337157	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.503994165697	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.495218849971	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.493615212808	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.492624401287	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.496865551809	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.491582733206	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.498119269463	And you know what?
0.0	0.496568024503	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
1.0	0.50807151951	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.49346866224	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...

0.0	0.497880925712	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.512894204544	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.443030980331	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.493187099792	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.48833437534	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.489238173812	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.505066363534	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.487893976621	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.488524103069	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.498154300525	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.499429908944	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.49521225336	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.497778598066	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.493242917431	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.375253178016	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.494421687517	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.496487034179	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.493439384233	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.401761811086	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.514963529508	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.492111797857	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.491153198009	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.485666026874	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.499310092797	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.495868786504	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.517601651057	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.498119269463	And you know what?
0.0	0.493878238401	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.493357674442	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.490181466612	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.378689534754	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.504367580542	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.512848672107	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.497925144382	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.497820830495	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.502439128767	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.487210628123	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.4183373347	Ever.
0.0	0.4980273289	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.446904176165	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.500253839904	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.495698896905	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.493880617066	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.491236439041	You really can't.
0.0	0.485854315493	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.490475196788	And here's why.
0.0	0.508229043743	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.507639333488	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.510366020951	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.502209991716	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.491007951013	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.398114621558	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.499964591629	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.500742941621	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.529503545179	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.495190196599	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.476513921702	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.500732263879	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.494388992574	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.380715297481	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.371401123083	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.4183373347	No.
0.0	0.487653025705	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.505230724225	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.502464685861	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.498960453351	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.499823000449	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.494121036753	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.502027459976	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.49553057597	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.483372601623	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.492875942067	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.502944474293	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.44332053132	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.495363288088	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.499568967521	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.486821186744	They know.
0.0	0.496503328548	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.493563348598	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.620288114454	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.495739142653	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.378127137823	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.510314250666	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.501474885207	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.501669052412	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.495390672926	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.491446379762	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.494277394399	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.494253500092	We don't win.
0.0	0.498121292975	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.488314709739	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.490744819831	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.491760363097	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.503935295308	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.494555305112	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.510994547093	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.499483085243	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.508689424044	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.490865650697	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.502893075922	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.4930381311	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.362430406806	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.498596227828	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.495814896245	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
1.0	0.494435275134	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.497911095343	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.487102151515	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.501794079181	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.485613370251	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.49692643612	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.494105375398	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.504550713352	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.500980239418	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.512886603989	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
1.0	0.507183973503	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.490411673472	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.506296572907	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.489504057248	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.493952927549	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.491347249209	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.504945490467	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.494554871568	This will end.
0.0	0.491104491714	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.4878498384	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.499550714341	They were wrong.
0.0	0.488646409835	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.53641012347	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.499286280815	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.494776492194	They can't even make a deal.
1.0	0.506920177357	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.494968654764	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.496941249111	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.496221394177	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.504561817112	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.483381306837	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.596137603743	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.517525865645	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.493005525352	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.495007237345	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.52211834825	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.512386606544	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.553315200531	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.49631966298	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.524037434016	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.506659123027	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.506704308051	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.51015510504	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.492056176497	You know that.
0.0	0.503915837915	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.488538061446	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.498867467433	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.498804576792	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.50057112622	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.515518534307	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.495902383813	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
1.0	0.497277318982	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.495293091472	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.495266064808	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.497715891011	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.501379251604	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.499142622584	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.489666517291	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.49076345168	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.49869228745	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.50059333079	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.495327095797	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.491932490845	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.357495962499	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.49698536794	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.494444746549	You bet they do.
0.0	0.492000153769	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
1.0	0.510765655976	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.488370057223	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.510734993627	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.502248256528	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.410175859066	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
1.0	0.512145041471	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.502765581334	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.50140960886	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.491237605324	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.458249858008	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.493526313621	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.505276986929	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.494638235353	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.496446759956	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.499153788622	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.368616866431	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.372223788752	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.499008573771	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.495372980582	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.49608625448	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.497236250185	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.488552883784	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.502654582275	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.486686958877	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.499987792997	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.490597313943	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.489571436	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.

0.0	0.495925220977	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.491865804349	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.49869638036	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?

0.0	0.494372655092	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.500571141289	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.491984191289	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.

0.0	0.443516769669	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.495878930018	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.

0.0	0.506155817338	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.

0.0	0.496265708582	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.489145182466	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.3581194946	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.515956259972	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.488059461969	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.506461036426	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.493104267091	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.488089421675	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.506518229947	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.432317853642	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.50055738802	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.501375049021	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.491842789306	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.498774201546	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.483404626167	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.497557967928	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.492184918473	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.48863491387	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
1.0	0.504719100221	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.492723530245	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.496510276038	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.498298976483	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.507436853488	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.37666954648	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.495683630834	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.497012494697	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.489176857159	I like that.
0.0	0.500327797988	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.48008364387	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.488299032228	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.505489386942	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.501060603002	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.501655182108	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.483132932826	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.561462298888	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.489559249963	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.48394902496	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.515049012029	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.501135266167	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.500717309791	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.498466571577	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.479080277545	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.49014824669	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
1.0	0.500335617697	They stole it.
0.0	0.483627232842	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.498263617052	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.469418701907	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
1.0	0.490832669856	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.49381720728	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.493456738546	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.501849978235	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.505198426947	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.359333442761	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.494482065883	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.494230688148	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.493321788862	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.49495343279	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.494804379142	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.505441996676	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.53040082378	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.49385948893	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.375059869077	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.495046556261	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.610670235411	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.51398708397	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.495867339501	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.494028013138	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.498873655123	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
1.0	0.493203122138	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.49798186971	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.492309691092	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.398117418261	They look around for gun-free zones.
1.0	0.510706887833	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.383355383025	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.50506213816	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.481915993321	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.485572285137	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.491386995705	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.505699013342	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.491669772287	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.503038121221	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.583443478745	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.498414390589	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.509571529397	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.500382032583	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.493818113293	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.487780632143	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.38528198713	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.491819871208	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.486691425235	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.492237352366	They're off to China.
0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.
1.0	0.499379093756	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.492650648301	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.499348870425	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.490014830879	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.485319985041	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.501684627407	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.495076194238	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.490425179775	I win.
0.0	0.500072366153	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.474198633539	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.505074027526	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.50053823433	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.556708503108	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.509736181917	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.497794419823	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.49163132011	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.496295974457	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.491934206665	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.502965226906	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.483679561349	I have...
0.0	0.528795686291	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.496551493623	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.481805036225	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.

0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.
0.0	0.49197161553	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.496344460649	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.487658801278	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.493786715268	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.488585021406	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.489341451331	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.500522487711	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.

0.0	0.488217081023	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.490020025296	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.487894972771	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.505848560344	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.502092039494	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.491148630228	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.490443739584	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.498651664001	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.491431492159	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.353561701888	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.503177061365	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.496484313224	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.492237352366	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.486835720512	It is.
0.0	0.506953453276	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.489160736514	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.48903865929	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.490779410971	We can't do it.
0.0	0.534303413542	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.487030891883	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.489200360067	I agree with them.
0.0	0.496258213214	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.490591156279	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.491596875058	That is not right.
0.0	0.499694961289	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.495567119478	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.489278335715	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.492281585874	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.489043727566	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.488094027951	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.488307965594	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.494426972335	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.493923816038	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.494554099687	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.484644482448	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.487608486721	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.376169846176	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.481111700188	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.377287245538	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.49548450506	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.512778570728	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.504448175158	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.493392805762	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.494326802831	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.494879883318	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.494324448422	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.508583868903	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.374676700934	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.495666188656	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.493636746795	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.500756021452	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.492624378648	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.497845086183	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.499199825131	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.490493796694	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.502834168475	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.495678362615	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.499846262727	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.399624543378	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.506259852979	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.489226687153	We have no borders.
0.0	0.499275381722	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.350021274919	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.491051014773	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.406776742961	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.509681316392	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.497089877558	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.506526948874	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.49490299893	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.495393468437	That's the difference.
0.0	0.49404925052	Can we stop?
0.0	0.489209554757	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.496129814404	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.491651043628	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.36355773865	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.375006476583	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.493196425516	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.495207681395	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.491840198443	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.506947910372	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.369612063837	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.494571793392	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.492142250706	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.493845772869	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.49460153108	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.492257044246	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.507395453098	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
1.0	0.501864005306	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.499545497459	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.441404454078	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.490299663497	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.492677236893	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.502533807029	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.488166764341	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.498668225607	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.519657851674	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.493192838205	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.513025674943	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.398542513125	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.497224641237	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.495464658225	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.370720599989	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.502989800709	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.497720210874	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.500133834113	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.495626034785	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.498557480557	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.492664913813	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.491075458118	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.51142418274	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.497735925879	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.557243177114	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.494208776219	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.51752644056	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.520503794026	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.536753025474	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.492118435586	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.494101903206	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.508613512373	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.488115501919	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.494477787815	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.496027793793	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.499865504188	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.496032433396	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.495495648645	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.505637842592	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.495681016154	Now, on to your substantive question.
1.0	0.507974931861	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.402110515874	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.478178095386	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.494195406965	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.494974203967	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.492229233292	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.495426461889	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.503652764587	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.492103977956	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.494796920778	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.512416141292	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
1.0	0.591403252462	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.497956219298	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.489823706464	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.487427596044	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.495752501697	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.506972626841	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.4984186191	That is our government today.
0.0	0.525131311189	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.512000535479	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.495481145576	We will work with our Sunni allies.

0.0	0.5246306427	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.496810698947	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.511830828819	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
1.0	0.497287231648	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.501164364369	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.496083923178	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.379842890553	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.

0.0	0.504844623569	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.464802793748	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.496503879167	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.499309232255	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.484773128645	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.496744545018	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.492064516053	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.494710584976	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.489451803379	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.49159996316	Think about that.
0.0	0.491326563649	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.495739453781	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.49822839148	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.529039079266	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.494269090364	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.493787916099	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.445308847584	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.503525535063	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.503051961142	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.4183373347	Yes.
0.0	0.437489665014	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.503732832971	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.484004712453	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.434774252359	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.498177920421	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.501377322762	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.496743770782	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.491005927933	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.494094549698	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.491351709589	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.493947092629	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.4183373347	Absolutely.
0.0	0.503436269008	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.491183620197	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.495328181577	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.490334515744	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.485795522149	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.531138368943	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.508609908363	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.476119466809	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.496928698102	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.484201744507	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.501754939065	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.493120425188	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.498111152388	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.371124533064	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.496617045159	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.497432446451	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.49821342747	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.499787071883	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.4183373347	Yes.
0.0	0.399333978404	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.494422225112	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.493574188527	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.496932070985	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.491904000128	I'm happy to answer the question...
1.0	0.491313547227	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.511352443269	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.504068501484	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.490687146963	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.495939565578	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.494580464781	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.497594712175	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.512055322265	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.492375081192	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.501880836764	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.493104242464	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.504839553877	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.493286771206	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.519864833353	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.491236526944	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.511354811575	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.491622208199	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.501548616389	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.492877556435	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.4183373347	Creativity.
0.0	0.503142872031	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.501531064097	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.373056579234	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.491263137521	How do I know this?
0.0	0.496095183981	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.494039993726	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.502456329184	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.357335512623	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.521915617333	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.51394620878	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.494344226355	I don't care.
0.0	0.483411212042	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.496708663207	I never said that.
0.0	0.501842911179	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.467773548744	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.508571477364	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.419222770139	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.502147781879	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.502650178573	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.489413211741	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.492681547331	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.506005532898	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.500084018954	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.494172102494	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.500045345434	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.501602805431	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.488626354646	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.531164834769	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.489094901335	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.499902885359	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.504170493003	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.498119269463	And you know what?
0.0	0.494515994695	(inaudible).
0.0	0.494903683782	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.506249062626	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
1.0	0.506791855717	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.499797328009	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.506401278274	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.495476577179	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.491204369713	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.487963059346	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.488120312013	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.493557826691	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.496489289997	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.511766097	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.491991063795	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.490510395815	You looking at me?
0.0	0.488623765802	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.495839997821	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.490198908796	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.486605475879	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.509489795416	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.488821255053	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.556485555532	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.502280751922	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.489936738254	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.494818534813	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.497791825741	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.499667920951	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.504209368641	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.517000942475	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.497923970105	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.469925326194	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.498672646595	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.490624524044	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.503692057649	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.513952150481	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
1.0	0.533152622435	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.493350663541	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.502892521008	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.497565800316	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.490131301113	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.493156781206	That's my view.
0.0	0.490379568385	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.499427613059	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.503232485831	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.49140652124	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.503404137226	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.495603604706	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.512118822616	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.435353858664	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.504569761907	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.49407150522	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.4183373347	Dynamically.
0.0	0.500142408736	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
1.0	0.508049991394	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
1.0	0.525905167017	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.477083990625	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.510832669869	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.529149164435	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.476984308391	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.49608625448	I said no.
0.0	0.497247572318	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.492226453995	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.495103076645	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.395478693393	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.502222050269	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.502009594441	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.499325030994	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.508194728262	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.509973755818	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.495341677398	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.495723788372	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.500771490291	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.484048811224	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.497528594406	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.496150149057	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.492830693887	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.505945550527	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.50586507433	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.500676611017	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.494595304079	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.505661794646	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.495112066933	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.502396158376	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.499106904802	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.498295717237	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.494033560469	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.497916963685	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.516199037092	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.496853293415	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.500877429633	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.484775019807	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.482711229187	...Chris...
0.0	0.498349461132	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.500017894669	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.490363892525	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.486477577312	And, the only way -- no...

0.0	0.504855909628	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.488874569086	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.483948454733	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.500584526579	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.504197610303	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.503374825087	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.507418341271	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.485691021907	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.497841436215	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.487468978431	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.490624524044	I will do that.
0.0	0.490846435888	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.358670191611	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.491841481218	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.486964845629	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.497889363735	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.49954767997	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.427541662049	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.502769746476	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.49079429558	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.375890935981	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.499541270195	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.445687489911	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.491885377053	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.493683317424	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.454922391364	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.504932323444	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.524859955358	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.49683048141	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
1.0	0.517519301718	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.500375536956	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.495641161147	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.497236352053	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.495282300173	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.406475108002	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.493862748489	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.484744855415	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.524709550284	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.494273474595	Both served.
0.0	0.495665092317	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.486135358039	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.549535081513	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.493989784196	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.398057542068	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.49684134112	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.497955847151	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.49504642795	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.490083909264	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.49414117312	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.49434783689	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.499407524347	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.499742591854	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.48969600591	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.502889608924	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.495475647008	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.366687896148	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.492645013496	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.498949763419	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.494181187125	And God bless America.
0.0	0.496863895518	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.496099377179	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.495905003449	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.497312046413	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.492204403	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.508881352951	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.493025555981	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.489165922825	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.497389527952	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.400448050167	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.501495788376	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.486919165927	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.502703394502	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.399300479887	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.495786848493	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
1.0	0.526470928389	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.497576121532	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.501377237317	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.361082122948	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.489545605529	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.513107542525	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.493864764871	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.552661927058	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.601386476461	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.489863976751	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.493516827969	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.49689946228	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.404002977708	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.514602400332	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.476551816508	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.498068685334	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.488463970766	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.491627598975	And we are not England.
1.0	0.499370664929	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.487998354163	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.49300663175	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.487943654241	No -- no...
0.0	0.487224652737	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.507057388376	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.496497416749	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.499305124271	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.501496775591	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.49159996316	Think about it.
0.0	0.483167906942	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.494194799411	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.493840508631	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.486364669905	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.493736812306	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.382754640822	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.501422384217	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
1.0	0.507976506769	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.49884186425	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.500969023164	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.
0.0	0.47956599359	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.508974894767	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.520750480918	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.520901285526	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.537595960731	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.492278394127	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.501736876081	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.508029531242	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.500208338244	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.4183373347	OK?
0.0	0.499217403279	Now we're having smaller families.
1.0	0.501963117846	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.497200621441	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.50185673711	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.492745243687	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.515526567475	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.496662016554	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.480187927121	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.524449814527	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.489436837558	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.510794714259	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.524579678785	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.495685991602	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.499544400191	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.495428849414	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.508880689491	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.504304039931	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.499525728212	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.485309941609	I think you're --
1.0	0.614525609733	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.496026658488	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.49868687923	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.496221475475	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.448963932508	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.487477720713	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.494900834091	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.
0.0	0.499501468318	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.496377325145	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.48447739563	In all due respect...
0.0	0.50142086535	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.505711575826	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
1.0	0.501990344011	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.496332549361	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.50225450997	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.49092716956	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.357396616011	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.498226941179	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.502054809657	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.498148975546	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.498117750074	We were wrong.
0.0	0.513325926635	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.384456155422	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.490343450137	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.492913057923	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.505096210843	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.50444573207	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.

0.0	0.540940214486	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.

0.0	0.52847988043	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.48577320636	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.

0.0	0.504465754415	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
1.0	0.50343017593	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.49315504167	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.

0.0	0.509069713102	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.502007850817	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.498119269463	And you know what?

0.0	0.493319941064	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.484733900882	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.491323096619	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.497564544034	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.48251246058	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.4183373347	Yeah.
0.0	0.496446049451	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.496158054814	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.481512893645	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.496255952232	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.495529764113	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.494999217146	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.495838529493	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.499690004841	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.499359214922	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.439737679526	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.397387297832	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.495991658361	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.498779709694	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.492673131686	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.50130794965	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.490735627543	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.536132660967	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.501797130318	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
1.0	0.513765377262	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.488385131831	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.494835297423	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.523822662876	In fact, that's part of the problem.

0.0	0.50623774006	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.

0.0	0.494101903206	He's wrong.

0.0	0.498863062788	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.415241280189	Becky --
0.0	0.392296312897	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.493559037012	I love this country.
0.0	0.498388592774	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.491763610599	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.496632191823	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.486292876357	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.48472313615	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.505055905679	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.518145784248	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.510357644922	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?

0.0	0.494482791173	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.492483726382	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.515735883762	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.503237705601	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.

0.0	0.498399039481	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.495186663294	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.488651857096	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.503628003668	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.48721276234	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.497200091572	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.507275106747	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.494244356923	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.494796920778	OK, good.
0.0	0.497173938105	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.493284372568	I would change them.
0.0	0.495003802995	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.497912454986	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.499571891425	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.496021856666	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.48612493569	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.495111276083	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.483470086844	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.491947996726	No, John.
0.0	0.497898284904	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.49081815805	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.492237352366	You get the Congress.
1.0	0.500640524789	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.394670330812	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.4183373347	Yes.
0.0	0.415241280189	...
0.0	0.393878101773	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.49975361376	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.498381576217	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.511433143293	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.494500075705	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.506136147509	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.502012388998	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.498352444936	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.493898995777	They have a responsibility, as well.
1.0	0.507973229688	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.499863208023	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.489776879063	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.531441314918	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.498375907015	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.399645984325	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.497353828835	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
1.0	0.497221732958	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.48241939298	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.497546040598	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.4183373347	OK?
0.0	0.415241280189	...
0.0	0.492893020217	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.490512031391	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.499886481976	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.499387120083	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.502692344765	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.496901001186	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.48928148891	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.498977322777	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.503297691336	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.495431299702	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.524452313165	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.51464633987	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.498182256455	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.376718324485	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.49453493651	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.499906890864	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.509276886077	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.495099941643	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.485802025645	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.491087299034	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.373478272551	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.4183373347	No.
0.0	0.497593192946	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.458277367189	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.494455351678	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.525125527329	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
1.0	0.514657816852	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.48712678946	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.524801009549	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.490625366116	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.50087618202	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.497503773596	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.401341106988	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.486115827844	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.505693720786	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.494318858373	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.494055268818	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.503785165555	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.492830364315	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.492232650697	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.504663661408	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.49608625448	She was right.
0.0	0.495606126363	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.49478365463	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.379729595727	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.496924255361	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.491207053439	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.504323040702	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.503154683842	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.495288523156	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.480471503022	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
1.0	0.508987267497	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.487122037511	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.492850421257	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.495241962926	A brief response.
0.0	0.48576601137	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.498117088445	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.491563601055	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.493178180084	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.4183373347	John?
0.0	0.492542954143	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.478105114131	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.514496681684	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.528132340863	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.503974004074	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
1.0	0.498426187789	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.489429470211	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.493186221912	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.490874076561	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.482361933592	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.501284862591	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.499085751513	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.512818472989	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.500602797606	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.491261617574	So you might not.
0.0	0.4963571026	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.496047116293	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.494562249066	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.50044051956	He hit oil.
0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.
0.0	0.494421529878	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.497126043029	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.491885123512	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.522577455987	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.51034019056	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.495046556261	They're a scam.
0.0	0.510772535692	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.497568251536	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.48638251036	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.4183373347	Right.
0.0	0.500520203496	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.499016149438	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.495665759254	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.524646472396	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.496134533856	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.48961538278	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.498306818562	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.502407071959	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.520419623318	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.493961702222	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.489179813708	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.502109812731	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.505183419692	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.556985568854	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.515271960531	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.495393697773	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.50025682357	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.434368155862	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.499190895597	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.526777858409	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.375544616447	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.50053949851	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.505467840589	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.487752472491	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.493358258408	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.50789404116	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.498668686946	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.492392263177	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.499078841523	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.473409594219	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.502388471815	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.503664774632	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.50283282808	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.50963034331	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.
1.0	0.502516601439	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.489167840914	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.548499864654	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.503459062545	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.499849343913	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
1.0	0.500438001326	They were wrong.
0.0	0.496984556875	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.480147046334	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.491831017518	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.495838303004	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.53160484853	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.51035803015	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
1.0	0.487966526001	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.504986770886	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.504705266613	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.484171820522	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.460014477637	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
1.0	0.496468260641	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.499576645202	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.494219437783	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.359860107683	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.502866226615	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.50044044004	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.493611646269	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.493961847796	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.495434773319	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.496013110925	Good at email.
1.0	0.516345486728	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.483237234415	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
1.0	0.510146220673	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.491592597918	And what we want to do is to control this.

0.0	0.493845044907	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.371508706858	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.4382163136	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.498125513519	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.519309922339	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.370165397978	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.490874076561	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.504944657976	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.522465976413	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.511314126221	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.499540176073	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.513896256735	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.493855440865	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.423263732573	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.490449256552	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.

0.0	0.50221570603	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.49922326277	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.401495062336	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.513501846991	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.496446791918	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.507876463443	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.49260895985	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.503094264267	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.488146505374	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.40234149805	I was the architect.
0.0	0.49159996316	Divide that out.
0.0	0.501547541939	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.486977867898	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.500457941057	And that was the state of Texas.

0.0	0.497875311385	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.497615801033	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.506799376375	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.49590962901	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.490547468919	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.495538176781	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.512231015154	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.502027489934	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.488993382955	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.513548486166	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.497294458343	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
1.0	0.494405985644	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.49404925052	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.496223057244	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.505945029429	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.49628226604	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.500382999509	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.49550649622	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.495460748413	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.491929502008	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.614391312035	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?

0.0	0.485177168763	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.

0.0	0.397111398765	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.498823961967	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.529303394889	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.583160170229	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.488520825353	I think he is right.
0.0	0.504580085434	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.487703365414	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.488624426811	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.497637004474	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.498786660772	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.495939249616	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.499233904168	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
1.0	0.51569407445	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.494270623496	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.495089639809	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.427715132634	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.494911488389	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.492250138203	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.498351630533	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.4183373347	No.
0.0	0.488641086723	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.503292098564	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.522107237527	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.498845321417	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.499744497353	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.489757822922	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.491941669204	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.526566072866	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.498075142728	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
1.0	0.505590617841	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.498779520185	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.506290274562	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.501265446134	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.489337656884	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.491510063129	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.493600987502	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.385950159057	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.496128830506	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.442493018808	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.372350132816	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.373743815009	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.467651149434	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.517966910268	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.491885995268	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.49125973891	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.493782201381	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.503592026697	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.488674359998	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.501143139902	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.374751097807	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.495595979727	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.493223672679	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.496141990185	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.476616224318	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.50173269848	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.486800853827	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.503400627811	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.483928777918	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.496011776415	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.509800644373	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.49834922473	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.501316872624	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.491887866315	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.413968042037	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.36264571927	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.491703114451	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.499084581027	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.510823344498	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.520782486551	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.492487651214	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.494517509888	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.443096944455	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.487658801278	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.495665092317	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.494147886696	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.502112851076	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.4975339679	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.503304792058	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.501539742441	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.435223581928	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.49123230239	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.502462368951	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.507603820015	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.45873868804	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.49974952456	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.49335929096	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.497261030099	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.497216455128	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.509453335482	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.495148208286	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.503221530036	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
1.0	0.493128045973	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.499712230567	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.493538347448	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.489226687153	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.494258403217	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.499066898167	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.494879883318	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.500180698589	I changed that.
0.0	0.525814693533	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.512692581046	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.520559745431	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.500745950987	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.520539770006	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.488430980764	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.4984319316	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.41790383704	Illegal.
0.0	0.424689514881	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.50241684879	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.516940528904	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.514008710536	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.523181764168	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.500710760814	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.448158372616	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.508873123347	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.488750541997	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.4183373347	OK?
0.0	0.489771890094	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.496762430914	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.360601223356	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.490970196322	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.49989959174	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.499358684351	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.497586903891	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.492862264036	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.486684026963	in particular.
0.0	0.498851848393	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.496443869592	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.505580568866	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.491087299034	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.568073458951	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.492031529395	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.488869808932	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.489153691171	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.497571452475	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.49426523984	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.498167148606	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.502495441938	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.400881946668	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.491435236449	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.500160101717	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.369534644527	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.569832758738	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
1.0	0.503114056679	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.501340987736	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.502239895435	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.490176341819	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.487976729655	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.492997735992	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.503737988509	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.498911252004	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.492001502626	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.414262426434	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.491409214677	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.50348475874	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.477845486914	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
1.0	0.522508551091	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.388926420361	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.490114762538	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.483613080254	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.519194306173	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.495140889725	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.494373966231	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.498953243662	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.494986266387	His family certainly believes that.
1.0	0.496474279514	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.494919571738	That is important.
0.0	0.493179638595	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.495046556261	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.491326281536	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.49057198868	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.492766130949	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.496168020636	We're friends.
0.0	0.494871543757	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.500004574902	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.495212813676	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.495021756898	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.489598204234	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.493400986595	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.472769016617	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.493993876209	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.493607575155	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.490281279529	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.518483740236	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.497697346812	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.489951577665	That has not been...
0.0	0.505364183207	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.492237352366	You're right.
0.0	0.371919893307	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.490419013574	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
1.0	0.500889239081	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.496290221807	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.477859957082	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.504197565232	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.500827939773	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.507047375489	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.498751043688	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.465470490924	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.494809685576	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.486548277891	And why?
0.0	0.52261318714	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.494709777337	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.49174427061	On welfare.
0.0	0.503343319025	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.503312487689	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.493673387575	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.494020130781	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.489567522863	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.491210441569	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.513691798757	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.510190067795	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.49331402615	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.521366098244	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.500017377834	He was on the board.
0.0	0.508296649254	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.497032373833	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.501295081214	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.371070494116	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.496029337249	He's wrong.
0.0	0.43275547814	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.485554473552	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
1.0	0.508412301664	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.498610138505	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.483627232842	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.428255070165	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
1.0	0.495760970814	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.494343844007	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.49795452426	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.499436031021	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.514032522925	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.492281882817	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.495090407752	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.510547721383	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.500823319408	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.491706018918	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.503919178432	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.495141661506	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.37119486503	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.493597676598	I've done it.
0.0	0.488986812742	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.486422326936	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.377661531974	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.527817660067	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.507669412043	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.496906166667	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.486364669905	Say again?
0.0	0.503867900148	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.495364399541	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.
0.0	0.46603487442	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.474951475633	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.491156182317	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.51695143958	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.489422835312	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.49608625448	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.528214156705	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.491476370607	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.515898529119	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.495374880307	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.488269475736	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.487965497514	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.505708536676	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.519057794792	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
1.0	0.498766395422	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.411453550934	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.502878040365	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.500084874237	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.499491463342	But I was born here.
0.0	0.4183373347	Right.
0.0	0.49159996316	Think about it.
0.0	0.502155095143	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.514964718489	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.493063005881	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
1.0	0.508458811619	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.496069332945	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.441674079437	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.50005079034	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.492459763212	We need sound money.
0.0	0.496816469213	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.560921221211	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.519775827091	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.504222203659	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.494001934811	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.488299032228	We have a country of borders.
1.0	0.50341072395	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.507456475156	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.357199440733	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.52189176048	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.497528527438	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.501489664496	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.495095074583	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.49798096273	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.503658111935	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.48947183942	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.486845308684	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.463473945547	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.497841332035	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.415241280189	Neil...
0.0	0.48644882656	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.494244307798	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.508569055587	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.491906767704	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.497954750288	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.504090101359	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.494286001151	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.490459900125	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.487696356201	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.458761172012	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.494405209156	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.506117200676	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
1.0	0.511831670019	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.495385236779	It's their money.
0.0	0.373597630323	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.492049612266	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.497937836727	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.520831823311	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.499855349204	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.496702094478	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.398542513125	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.492931166047	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.488579657187	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.497676867924	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.498477574662	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.496730384433	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.519917397956	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.490593502703	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.4961291254	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.504838118681	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.488255071395	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.495605573994	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.496708663207	I never said that.

0.0	0.510391207195	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.491190023713	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.468499798008	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.499709447057	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.512404467604	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.492684580406	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.51566086681	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.

0.0	0.501496575509	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.488383958753	I don't like that.
1.0	0.508010589676	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.501454637588	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.511768381565	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.

0.0	0.491672017897	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.493660532579	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.533872817079	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.493495347517	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.526087172087	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.497409948589	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.

1.0	0.49979115547	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.36161676614	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.499734907806	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.492817518442	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
1.0	0.492724903269	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.494008095523	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.497858161586	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.502045609832	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.498956965684	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.493879033403	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.372196811035	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.484856287088	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.490165598291	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.594954733165	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.435477106344	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.490792716305	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.511493254396	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.494806778313	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.512124779516	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.490849316174	It was.
0.0	0.516650557467	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.491697335907	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.53685743422	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.517154189014	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.502116475993	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.494143675952	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.375052162984	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.497137428369	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.492393002136	How about this?
0.0	0.514912056867	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.49282522915	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.5102291946	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.494813913629	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.494946344133	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.501962043546	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.495035959099	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.429346113024	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.531316641611	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.513975539439	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.499163200502	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.487591054105	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.487002180632	We do.
0.0	0.49608625448	I got that.
0.0	0.624077708388	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.50267323569	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.501685804912	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.457001481427	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.442471461149	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.498600973144	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.357877323675	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.502374611355	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.49494536233	It's a joke.
0.0	0.494553776573	I would change them.
0.0	0.498406335849	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.493660373906	I get to respond, right?
1.0	0.493596078692	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.495986805559	So we have a disagreement on this.
1.0	0.499157905239	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.488517113423	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.492599676114	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.508075652492	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.4183373347	Right.
0.0	0.514428019562	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.500293776412	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.494738356661	That's not true.
0.0	0.491439078299	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.391323009311	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.486749967393	I understand.
0.0	0.437517504994	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.50006760293	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.490779410971	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.493227694835	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.502152437877	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.49230142271	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.490991766397	White people?
0.0	0.498374580692	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
1.0	0.60171004197	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.497520718433	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.4183373347	Absolutely.
0.0	0.485762820029	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.499255194738	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.497556345437	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.486656573011	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.491373630172	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.497396669379	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.490559240253	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.49591027879	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.493404061787	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.4183373347	No.
0.0	0.50084388409	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.495161486053	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.495589284301	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.394403799763	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.492047213488	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.56894589217	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.495675144186	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.491582343683	You're welcome.
0.0	0.605222740646	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.500912952143	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.503009788891	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.499917560339	I know every one.
0.0	0.498085695527	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.490000670632	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.495927740764	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.487721778726	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.500197518286	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.495786345097	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.495116322868	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.500007481697	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.490952980242	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.489686987246	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.494468380028	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.493628296279	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
1.0	0.501762063295	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.490955739393	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.504331710163	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.507001359461	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.494800805045	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.506380512713	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.
0.0	0.486842496711	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.495509530278	He does great.
0.0	0.522861371994	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.398383686085	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.513183041945	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.488676691937	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.506223620338	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.499715806004	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.495527401858	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.514989633742	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.492745643954	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.498602990838	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.497886946989	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.492997724843	You find me...
0.0	0.363486787656	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
1.0	0.612602408224	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.487949545586	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.49698623939	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.539985482084	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.563756864747	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.500372230236	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.499047548143	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.500429880814	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.499955730353	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.491843095435	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.560826093218	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.439128437097	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.390346337298	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.511962642865	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.558045053108	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.507880749044	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.490316902405	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.517487559852	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.473130307568	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.493223544203	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.495413723094	And that's what we have to contrast.
1.0	0.525890309352	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.508619808973	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.485462843437	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.500397365473	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.489965812478	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.505838281587	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.510654202213	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.495502415757	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.376879133956	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.519386456273	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.498377940054	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.490129753102	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.534437648769	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.498102627954	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.495538736582	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.504895503469	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.491054220018	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.503053124061	I've got a track record.
1.0	0.557869286664	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.495665759254	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.505005921645	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.495795834587	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.516187958037	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.497392052125	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.495259248128	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.493597676598	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.498410931068	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.492870272054	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.485254026551	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.499367571617	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.510545246502	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.486529939938	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
1.0	0.5105132654	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.493260095387	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.486675132685	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.498170536471	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.490545687742	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.490646789612	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.518930802607	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.502150553804	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.497605001222	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.488933949341	This country is changing.
0.0	0.492913293676	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.509267570753	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.486598240626	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.493915013924	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.492685869515	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.502878523383	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.495090663287	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.499387930285	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.49381786325	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.528072123297	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.500543949513	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.502451602599	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.4183373347	No.
0.0	0.505580743723	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.369628126505	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.493921068668	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.494445743175	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.37384842941	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.491415699189	That's for sure.
0.0	0.495548509695	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.491271024969	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.496633956864	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.495523784428	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.55750911203	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.487524346087	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.492905923431	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.502938061891	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.496979790597	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.530002601224	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.498717706257	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.485828958965	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.511873472156	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.492711922485	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.516371776176	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.497885405637	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.488151393323	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.498729221005	So you know what?
0.0	0.522136243372	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.502832884668	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.493763584875	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.495334712552	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.511739444863	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.518079098916	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.49138897642	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.510848205902	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.49916409817	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.491812335714	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.489820917553	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.495284805119	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.49182022394	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.492349364249	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.493679941244	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.495986805559	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.490921894783	Our next president...
0.0	0.415241280189	...
0.0	0.492005593448	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.494342053347	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.488898159176	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.491389296949	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.494291999771	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.490598286992	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.498699272609	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.491412865829	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.505354574007	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.490097378826	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.501794488309	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.493634521923	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.510148460372	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.491198101869	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.502603019278	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.518694713476	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.504604982303	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.496077545037	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.495559464367	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.498276302265	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.505253015832	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.491783216835	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.525797573082	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.501603841761	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.502996702103	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.508570980315	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.50134553389	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.503611840725	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
1.0	0.547578453727	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.525866915494	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.500823673604	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.496371736523	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.491562844573	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.433480103262	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.555832481989	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.498121636101	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.518908341871	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.489940459592	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.507466641613	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.4183373347	Yeah.
0.0	0.493259072687	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
1.0	0.499739355713	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.494698400089	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.520373069997	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.495264685911	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.495267213813	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.512831378134	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.496713837185	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.498518168777	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.494151141754	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.499512099818	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.493041874139	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.49086023757	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.495930569531	What have you got now?
0.0	0.401607100499	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.492708791987	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.493914946152	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.413423456302	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.491734019986	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.497581553103	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.496212305355	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.506355921688	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.488538690633	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
1.0	0.504556476436	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.510054448134	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.496125651497	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.487938612776	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.490624524044	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.502031909522	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.490793685762	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.492979588269	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.497566715449	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.484060890706	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.49240448957	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.503986993013	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
1.0	0.503452718461	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.497533716405	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.497121193328	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.484876782623	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.48544643624	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.487485015061	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.459010413366	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.515482839328	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.49363249831	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.575431774878	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.509820053747	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.494620791787	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.470862572473	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.524486417602	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.494424578222	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.506944926565	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.490595963382	...Thank you.
0.0	0.491665264654	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.492882611003	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.510311952203	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.502656363839	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.5105580575	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.374690634949	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.491444313389	You don't have to.
0.0	0.487824495685	That's what we need.
0.0	0.510372720034	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.491120215686	Wait for what?
0.0	0.491763519551	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.398542513125	The answer is no.
0.0	0.486638062815	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.500343984178	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.502828245117	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.501582786242	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.407181775544	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.497390030892	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.499458140892	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.57478001245	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.493317230703	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.491630936315	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.498962192075	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.505891491843	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.491947996726	No, no.
0.0	0.500303122954	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.49389069847	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.417813405136	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.481669947298	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.499383933952	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.4183373347	Right.
0.0	0.507570760609	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.501093537806	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.363414695111	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.492741437057	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.48394902496	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.508775058168	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.5224378268	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.495905003449	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.495184353013	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.495077874639	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.488487947151	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.48595710347	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.496874292421	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.516046643685	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.496928235156	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.498163518164	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.494918090334	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.509958423621	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.497655180081	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.504082873941	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.495662353248	I have no idea.
0.0	0.481876652303	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.489991918546	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.488900825078	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.360479544104	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.508380863431	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.493593286705	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.500172296942	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.374210651781	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.500081793335	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.495190196599	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.374819245404	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.49853082614	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.490468578597	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.501442923447	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.482893015741	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.501922879781	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.51256804297	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.49608625448	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.531473333565	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.360017769037	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.492376973006	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.502444602894	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.481454083953	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.491376897368	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.510385544004	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.493703262654	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.491257284921	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.497884576903	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.499568369688	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
1.0	0.496168020636	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.486603845967	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.493229361059	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.501583835027	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.4963957884	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.490017935378	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.49334030188	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.500017377834	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.481679616328	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.507469963163	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.353744295337	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.497786334674	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.552501621839	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.509697431559	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.486364669905	Thank you.
1.0	0.506061185696	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.496452394488	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.494731812147	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.507641403181	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.499358684351	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.501838125769	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.495816577423	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.495283999021	That's what I said.
0.0	0.50924047428	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.494141848759	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.499598557082	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.457655736173	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.355640825755	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.498016150383	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.491902963981	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.490883735423	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.393796403711	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.490197501279	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.498073180398	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.499445607652	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.493106682813	I want security.
0.0	0.491007911595	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.506128001089	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.48094522982	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.509411588185	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.504933057904	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.518799984422	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.499301057419	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.513548402902	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.493638545752	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.497827064606	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.494740385176	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.492525389243	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.522132612656	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.496371765528	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.502398642191	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.4980151858	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.444487190172	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.490328840882	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.498823266523	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.497902896691	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.500514862521	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.493521227152	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.485811693322	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.494435677146	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.498407719995	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.487866565915	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.368316602643	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.556780657447	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.504791496182	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.493862748489	I totally get that.
0.0	0.495841272011	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.499730259076	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.498686156432	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.492892294605	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.493901247805	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.49205871077	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.463942112332	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.498856542597	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.492479965942	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.496007186016	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.376489331533	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.498584928121	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.494263544796	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.526967869422	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.366907373752	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.50564130239	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
1.0	0.503865229478	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.496083049036	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.498904219174	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.491238812134	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.498288940963	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.492895058078	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.497958965965	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.495662353248	We're running.
0.0	0.502717834749	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.496741965917	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.390048764665	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.485252120786	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.49736943903	The problem is we never get it done.
1.0	0.528936008344	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.497260581834	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.496320494197	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.496387144332	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.511457850069	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.497957332525	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.494434757957	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.488737325831	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.505935655474	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.508724501423	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.497612829839	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.498321305108	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.579932208264	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.488999719574	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.478967064235	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.499958377245	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.486329971823	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.419563374148	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.501412484359	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.520010855719	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.502390720142	She voted for it.
0.0	0.545481631085	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.510368369122	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.498015757822	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.501826309168	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.480995397108	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.537760494982	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.

0.0	0.490624524044	I will not do that.
0.0	0.500600073425	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.

0.0	0.488138830647	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
1.0	0.506574787174	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.488402529904	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.514432902415	And the last piece is this.

0.0	0.494806649093	I agree with my colleagues.

0.0	0.524426543676	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.502097023883	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.

0.0	0.497969380561	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.510263859885	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.493789004517	But I would add this.

0.0	0.49250657679	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.488504529422	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.501329173173	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?

0.0	0.502674006618	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.522486574228	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.

0.0	0.491538418124	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.496600900183	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.483070072073	But look...

1.0	0.510309951374	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.504901375801	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.

0.0	0.374071952592	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.493535846445	And our economy was growing like crazy.
