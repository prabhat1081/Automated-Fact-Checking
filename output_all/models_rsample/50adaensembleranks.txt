0.0	0.514011064754	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.497365480917	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.497135508798	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.497619961005	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.496635964766	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.44331711668	No.
0.0	0.496760634248	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.503200207124	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.499077996463	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.504024675078	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.506209281508	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.490707220943	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.533552288197	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.499873445513	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.503405009293	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.493137787479	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.51685035397	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.496253492763	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.50160935902	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.507147574197	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.50014407943	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.49751698255	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.502703841954	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.488236401067	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.442210057375	Yes.
0.0	0.501373376619	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.494762690202	Can we stop?
0.0	0.501080251671	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.450641580432	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.507170376859	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.506777650507	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.499846893363	But you know what?
0.0	0.512800996668	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.500870324064	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.495043979524	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.490254992327	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.51123864987	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.388986082512	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.499855904806	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.489311927541	I can't do it.
0.0	0.489749330624	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.481521308935	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.491186822291	It was.
0.0	0.48718456786	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.499567247839	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.503966768505	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.492453026672	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.3947324826	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.495704955651	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.504273075787	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.507944550967	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.50290849687	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.499465190986	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.500451831851	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.504989251619	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.498869195602	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.498408140327	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.496697934125	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.498759781995	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.503379654163	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.481145485611	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.523427517998	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.442210057375	Yes.
0.0	0.388750302141	Here's the truth.
1.0	0.509826470732	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.501840215272	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.495349455735	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.494923366801	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.507445320824	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.487933850098	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.487108054706	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.517442171671	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.494308667603	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.492513801471	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.506645923631	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.492819122317	That's my view.
0.0	0.491382566161	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.514879335105	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.494837065194	She was right.
0.0	0.496949831263	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.519049562006	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.496164597883	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.501473732227	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.494956407372	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.494527016545	In addition to that...
0.0	0.518788326557	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
1.0	0.503177816229	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.492545367009	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.485404344936	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.49988384416	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.499846893363	And you know what?
0.0	0.496564416935	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.497399311773	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.493682590758	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.493598882824	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.495412441143	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.498145176923	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.491431556908	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.500641370189	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.500134069672	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.507622100758	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.491838219677	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.509388860236	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.501416230842	He hit oil.
0.0	0.50104652281	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.495758429348	It's a joke.
0.0	0.494505734829	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.442210057375	Yes.
0.0	0.505944814877	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.500414315521	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.509183676699	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.491170003399	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.506537298956	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
1.0	0.599874086045	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.50499500624	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.497699171771	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.500017544626	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.491329619527	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.482776602511	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.507563663221	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.499708964058	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.49523157003	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.500310008307	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.515558210605	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.498635556148	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.491749993787	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.501373720801	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.507094946131	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.512178990404	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.496723816903	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.51227096321	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.509934125913	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.503001057741	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.499694657782	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.501277972397	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.496809951924	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.512293754634	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.497207617734	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.500297815637	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.501767729905	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.495676522488	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.508421297495	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.494580270794	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.514824169462	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.500040161425	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.498117339473	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.499100523713	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.50670436633	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.497628843531	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.506646991444	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.512574465495	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.495554270375	We don't win.
0.0	0.493185171307	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.496319031206	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.50923208524	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.504934559063	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.498514948271	This is 2016.
0.0	0.369634501719	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.487898259652	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.509270819478	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.496763975272	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.500562077965	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.511503819585	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.393821720024	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.485840321893	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.492898360512	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.508901288157	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.540298013321	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.501188935413	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.495112569702	I was not at all.
0.0	0.497014702712	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.500179239979	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.499244876432	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.496434838975	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
1.0	0.491986886113	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.498084206159	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.516456052405	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.493033637826	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.491438096171	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.504514692623	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.48309475277	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.501409998738	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.494584710702	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.499369055329	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.492261659717	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.52729720561	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.499701338094	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.494847008197	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.48557469457	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.500008027698	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.499111431571	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.494069816593	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.492633561121	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
1.0	0.4957444188	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.495876969128	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.490911786336	No, John.
0.0	0.524753747523	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.498040369523	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.496921650938	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.

0.0	0.485640432916	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.

0.0	0.514991860396	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.

0.0	0.500910154643	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.502051227581	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.330510921154	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.

0.0	0.497936114299	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.506709673983	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.

0.0	0.512989395158	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.388645586032	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.336290947231	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.

0.0	0.49598784429	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.497518639104	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.487670651529	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.503830729851	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.502411696084	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
1.0	0.515200302747	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.500755592909	He was on the board.
0.0	0.48139486412	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.512557283799	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.49615011066	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.503183531225	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.494329356802	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.50230426126	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.498574200531	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.49690321357	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.480312282626	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
1.0	0.633383626304	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.495489985893	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.496446481998	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.486980019331	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.510954512956	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.501289414439	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.512179917771	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.484500671482	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.497308390895	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.500194227859	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.496839247767	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.38630975203	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.503094029601	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.497513139707	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.498365485536	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.501070223872	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.

0.0	0.504668787939	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.481812456252	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.49482818094	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.497217643977	I have no idea.
0.0	0.490701301343	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.485226839941	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.493656298102	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.338002271732	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.497684522749	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
1.0	0.49738497708	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.498876014917	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.487803753761	They don't like that.
0.0	0.51436448976	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.502807185078	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.498371934072	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.492583999129	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.513838539778	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.490631474966	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.496662739308	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.491577535579	It goes away.
0.0	0.501452076245	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.494320157169	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.490345338295	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.484750280052	I have...
0.0	0.511504761644	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.498982539607	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.492039895908	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.489757252539	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.497925968624	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.495194995292	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.507938383906	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.4998173416	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.493895449013	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.487803753761	I don't like that.
0.0	0.497566531138	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.493787444048	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.499639362323	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.497101332148	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.536909321829	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.491148675293	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.500958868155	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.494788292376	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.498182120884	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.494144600899	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.511299204085	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.510500700728	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.493846750479	I win.
0.0	0.490718643447	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
1.0	0.497540329601	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.498969945218	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.453467892715	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.513229562414	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.342227006996	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.499173355817	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.494803220837	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.496717616242	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.498154895049	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.492757995645	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.503647472285	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
1.0	0.524167329835	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.503101603435	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.493869244414	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.487928404276	It is.
0.0	0.49164791202	You get together.
0.0	0.492197989474	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.499709938886	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.512915635783	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.336534681395	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.505651733137	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.513692055682	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.492063947676	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.509651259696	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.499626494589	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.553721843653	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
1.0	0.498206579652	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.507196815872	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.501184839809	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.49148988339	I'd like to jump in.

0.0	0.36123198135	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.5006176215	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.443517029869	Right.
0.0	0.358222387819	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.532601397177	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.494245139252	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.498940469653	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.512210718328	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.501788838101	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.499117432783	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.503151913095	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.491292640829	You know that.
0.0	0.490927981196	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.495230292409	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.497548634532	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.442210057375	OK?
0.0	0.498439243692	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.

0.0	0.363365107855	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.328834134033	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.495639997296	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.515682172043	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.418287479236	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.507221799435	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.500965531678	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.507525712406	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.494935208432	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.507589676969	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.498240549196	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.504148102172	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.489951887792	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.498925492791	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.494685416698	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.497281446155	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.505272255038	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.507028151247	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.490501523936	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.500107332897	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.497186880201	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.495012012772	Let me just close it out this way.
1.0	0.497733987536	Very few children.
0.0	0.504997676537	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.495322624097	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.497319986128	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.498284643036	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.488172497731	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.515666326259	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.542051540525	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.352944763149	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.499921763389	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.487684613966	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.491868644547	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.424108999447	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.491489259425	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.442210057375	OK?
0.0	0.494440166586	That will change everything.
0.0	0.498098343917	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.479858515846	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.550413927611	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.490252283871	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.495082574473	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.504971697482	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.498655028721	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.51823694724	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.391180150765	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.499157661959	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.502449522711	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.495081437615	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.492065471317	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.493454870079	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.51107721079	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.510904558945	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.505725404026	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.50492042716	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.488380516968	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.442210057375	Yeah.
0.0	0.371833809482	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.502446033559	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.463349427979	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.490578911802	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.497267027438	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.492236383825	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.4940917485	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.502423392048	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.49595633337	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.484340465641	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.49499630821	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.33997494029	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.494843376847	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.479889743573	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.518772684902	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.487035800557	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.499148762519	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.338588424017	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.498949188716	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.49938694366	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.506956708299	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.413477438768	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
1.0	0.601294306025	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.501549086148	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.392959277858	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.493839563414	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.487125929541	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.491773955482	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.488391004597	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.496235340822	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.500024552146	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.496789708401	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.513690185841	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.487984065804	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.506262161199	It is time to believe in America again.
1.0	0.498815590483	I was not at all critical of him.
1.0	0.506287543021	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.488726040755	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.345405740743	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.491926057794	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.493090952284	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.495926904424	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.50306053379	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.497195577072	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.504975705074	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.495185920445	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.492951907614	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.51937076407	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.403165219248	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.506765274473	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.404391672898	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.424300292075	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.491052214632	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.440169771643	Maria...
0.0	0.49914146059	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.496502556204	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.497310703565	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.50084760337	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.494580306508	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.4925614534	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.497339419256	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.335379223587	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.504617129952	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.509385570228	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.497772698725	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.497938850081	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.489311927541	We can't do it.
0.0	0.487841262919	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.50762639249	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.503658695024	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.501544577416	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.497564060858	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.483855921139	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.511477797233	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.4968392501	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
1.0	0.525641660874	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.494404600459	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.49999638124	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.391217429437	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.489667385623	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.531255856472	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.516549619116	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.348206483778	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.498278838076	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.495419849147	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.504387630578	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.495466345527	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.494649130207	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.383162287072	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
1.0	0.346538195768	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.496768317577	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.49600986416	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.496750750563	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.396844738849	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.48988504421	I understand.
0.0	0.510402187153	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.494547333089	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.498607546408	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.44331711668	John?
0.0	0.504505400303	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.508189274459	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.502667146353	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.501518724578	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.504667611914	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.495099203708	What have you got now?
0.0	0.502618218826	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.501142499939	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.490858164878	He undermines it.
0.0	0.515244309591	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.506973412925	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.505105728503	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.496208161031	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.

0.0	0.412263149788	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.

0.0	0.495499097424	Look, the -- the deal is already done.

0.0	0.507139543515	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.541200592535	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.517330266139	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.498753870339	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.4986061854	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.492443999014	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.513090043631	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.

0.0	0.494190588162	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.501314637964	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.516862291596	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.491620302421	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.493534910008	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.486947252992	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.499048542526	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.495022420575	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.518184337816	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.492280993305	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.49767209125	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.504047794488	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.49645964069	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.50729604943	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.

0.0	0.484704291256	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.492326458369	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.494363745465	That's what I said.
0.0	0.495627642588	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.492072532754	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.337044921564	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
1.0	0.496882400548	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.507212812671	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.504005715928	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.496287074658	That is important.
0.0	0.493526239302	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.491577535579	It never happens.
0.0	0.496023665532	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.51826948873	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.505859468932	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.495027493751	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
0.0	0.501954509636	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.507867556792	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.494903784071	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.506709673983	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.50511696151	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.503646477048	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.500329071751	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.505540646932	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.482840569763	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.493657199281	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.498117648959	So we have a good group of people.
1.0	0.517569229368	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.496024329722	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
1.0	0.590066718242	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.558315238285	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.494860879816	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.492564916834	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.489837985827	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.496709065728	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.512148402754	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.490591886684	Think about it.
0.0	0.496056284048	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.513150912146	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.442210057375	Yeah.
0.0	0.499342083408	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.49930179607	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.487130250962	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.499940059815	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.499192007392	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.519306253347	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.398371207477	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.487134408822	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.497176755726	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.496683168704	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.502539909625	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.498237080535	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.498275410214	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.504808136644	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.488247106533	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.508495513103	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
1.0	0.50482510485	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.366610878532	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.497495964092	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.494643808423	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.533052017809	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.496473627661	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.485156436727	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.498569661341	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.499082230981	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.500675198381	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.496632649069	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.498126232621	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.487891058928	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.341824425837	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.46257714257	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.372477246638	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.497079707701	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.506418776725	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.504323275042	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.499261591996	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.518332382342	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.339052463884	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.47587624151	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.499749294856	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.494026056346	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.497367467252	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.277041404404	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.443517029869	Ever.
0.0	0.49421796731	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
1.0	0.493257932612	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.498753925538	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.499683445339	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.498567830516	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.497200135807	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.470589986531	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.499697480676	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.481147232343	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.485131320501	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.495489549924	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.54824918866	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.503291328327	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.492617074332	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.497155614929	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.515336695198	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.498480705813	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.476607298025	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.493702875936	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.497458986895	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.496412769547	No vision at all.
0.0	0.479181098847	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.495199789324	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.5014140116	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.493802463313	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.491990573583	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.495383420563	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.495678177649	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.490696369069	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.488065734093	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.499307761246	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.492720937147	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.390288334554	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.48685142006	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.501436875183	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.497124890528	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.492704243535	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.518588208129	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.468636825637	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.496140441668	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.490035656702	This country is changing.
0.0	0.505901015667	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.499685165046	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.512610564965	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.486683556649	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.496916584376	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.503678585503	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.501282197332	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.50022631305	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.500583542259	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.49545089118	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.493719762939	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.505757405607	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.44331711668	No.
0.0	0.51230081667	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.495683948671	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.442210057375	OK?
0.0	0.499259208764	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.495378145452	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.510899745023	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.49788832032	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.496279441279	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.

0.0	0.334944026238	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.497279218505	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.501593466894	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.488241956411	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.491608949676	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.

1.0	0.495019579746	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.486946820033	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.494324490988	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.501948518495	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.524909050285	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.512198405225	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.492762219678	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.539053015527	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.496322438963	My point is this.
0.0	0.473083633006	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.351774804017	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.495727727792	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.486550261814	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.534146112947	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.495167525581	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.49391616031	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.494314310292	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.506694599216	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.505106768849	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.489104645899	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.50992344479	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.509244054948	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.505283993699	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.498319193834	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.494456099888	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.499065844044	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.512992691397	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.493184423608	I love China.
0.0	0.49120419399	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.503060821476	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.4887692704	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.494954303082	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.495093269125	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.493507775101	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.512897899398	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.495646563544	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.503538669185	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.492776601451	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.503787561116	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.492338815304	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.494949004031	You know, you look at women working.
1.0	0.508062670133	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.414289083163	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
1.0	0.500437297824	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.494373161795	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.492775593471	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.493832403622	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.496651658152	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.498816564412	You know why three?
0.0	0.484700477916	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.496675749066	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.484812064484	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.488618157748	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.499683987652	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.485610996671	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.498034751195	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.513605677373	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.391712307056	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.505128833435	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
1.0	0.496538890858	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.497089767528	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.509497856514	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.494742063439	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.495647259945	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.50022387136	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.505956029937	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.496325042436	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.499877776567	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.501639070566	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.504797918554	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.479863571717	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.508853630974	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.486360123981	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.36553690346	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.36269112455	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.393778272893	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.499401252061	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.4909180156	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.507416337072	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.487533743335	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.49288561788	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.488836506924	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.494273915634	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.496824608667	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.494196319148	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.510077888082	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.502456099927	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.503520381818	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.390580586115	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.505646247608	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.499904795501	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.50740876577	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.493291476028	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.495603015023	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.487595758623	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.511714471291	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.502354946208	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.485758147475	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
1.0	0.517521866683	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.496638136149	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.51025312399	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.465553421394	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.334852153452	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.490511890644	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.493747216281	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.495519691703	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.497877617705	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.50904660004	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.489088784994	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.497580875496	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.502436789852	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.490394106567	You're welcome.
0.0	0.495590540329	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.501357744028	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
0.0	0.49769990303	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.496675859682	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.495656032591	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.344233685647	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.493621162803	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.498334567034	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.491477197149	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
1.0	0.508565200856	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.493502008	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.499695662494	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.506074892544	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.484546918639	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.499205444698	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.4973931262	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.492163380338	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.503894516464	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.528450154756	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.493624828828	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.347758301143	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.494784776495	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.496503895527	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.498597911115	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.627547063579	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.495979067115	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.495826727909	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.499049761349	I know every one.
0.0	0.506106475677	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.503502830653	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.48423684945	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.497365480917	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.502251894885	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.503094779044	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.504700068962	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.49671093266	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.487626723831	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.50449039017	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.494759746624	We actually did it.
0.0	0.497669584543	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.495947329366	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.488929137882	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.504033558487	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.498596246752	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.488247852015	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.507590565074	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.506957022266	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.372299032292	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.483609701879	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.499979904023	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.497781888663	I am not a member of the political class.
1.0	0.506219639432	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.491451097237	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
1.0	0.508752744436	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.493914960823	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.501861658369	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.490988134261	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.483614097934	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.49496224828	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.498141235604	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.494428950463	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.48900945787	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.496826451055	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.518647131939	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.49448245013	This will end.
0.0	0.497310710098	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.494644640328	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.505080853467	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
1.0	0.511196834349	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.498765284653	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.491610337196	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.489674902968	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.498940512829	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.495409245841	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.507963384582	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.5107207934	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.49989342295	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.440169771643	...
0.0	0.487998747233	We do.
0.0	0.505470045866	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.493927046089	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.496513675824	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.493037195102	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.489102151192	You can have him.
0.0	0.49956473394	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.428837826508	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.497038050982	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.499603128987	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.498413646292	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.486725360641	And why?
0.0	0.494191642793	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.492883294037	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.502819364045	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.494531108586	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.502724305017	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.520070655862	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.506362083277	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.497914739053	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.495401607494	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.501877966805	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.495551263176	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.495427051361	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.496602064412	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.487126867061	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.501420308446	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.516947949071	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.499113220936	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.495281177013	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.497638166281	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.499943405664	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.507017319845	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.497985855075	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.505023831263	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.353133429145	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.509735967635	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.506162900622	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.502431745978	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.492383405566	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.55378126729	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.498219590561	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.494127088371	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.495282446168	That's good.
0.0	0.498818775389	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.502199614862	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.494417734591	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.4955513039	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.500850776449	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.498080668086	That's how you make peace in the world.
1.0	0.496382852647	That's wrong.
0.0	0.518435506177	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.492740935878	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.502001598473	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.504903099666	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.527827300115	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.491702892326	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.455092651722	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.499197357333	They were wrong.
0.0	0.49854972938	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.466765362974	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.490292589939	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.516717425554	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.49365135992	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.497130717383	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.507914073765	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.49981048879	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.492435785646	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.477758642618	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.504784927087	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.483412042473	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.49001461421	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.49164791202	We haven't.
0.0	0.494686177683	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.497719301351	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.490487482146	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.490830920052	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.499140520634	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.496813490819	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.535147093778	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.490641581747	That's for sure.
0.0	0.516071204409	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
1.0	0.503601132247	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.487949658256	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.506566507813	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.512943547824	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.504664553751	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.499387000493	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.494087260673	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.514005601664	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.500327226625	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.49340424114	We need to reverse that.
1.0	0.494536819859	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.495789152834	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.495982870123	(inaudible).
0.0	0.492425849468	Our next president...
0.0	0.490659789731	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.498073110845	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.504742855436	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.505882263696	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.484724483714	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.500859390919	This was a question on entitlements.
1.0	0.535404892967	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.507375765381	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.494307842496	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.497142470705	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.577534267896	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.33761008603	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.50097661433	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.504632286253	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.492005325569	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.495665474251	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.498034128842	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.497078369363	Both served.
0.0	0.50271664366	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.500463501978	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.503784275835	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.51752070886	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.494645898475	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.490593294531	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.496460921152	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.498664463549	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.487002768578	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.492560817077	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.35017925737	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.339771859105	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.504342790047	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.277883461507	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.498084404072	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.495092946401	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.499066191545	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.492260602869	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.490892471688	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.499651144343	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.497230080704	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.502454448792	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.491139266397	That's what he is.
0.0	0.48863745665	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.490381044248	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.497066445783	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.499730487365	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.407808170503	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
1.0	0.50244256899	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.489708580922	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.502601508479	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.495951232278	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.390988977679	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.49874382615	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.506715840887	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.499861816624	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.502152125211	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.500506532085	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.483488685746	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.494607414774	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.489384898822	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.506292579313	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.390337671425	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.497276749183	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.497118260386	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.497217059836	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.519154116872	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.498712066523	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.49351228339	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.487046916725	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.498094034702	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.361653288671	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.487685510331	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.493683351235	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.495059859371	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.492027864568	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.502900173922	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.498591316166	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.495821522042	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.494049162378	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.460619716639	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.505112365667	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.493505963315	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.495567087228	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.495067026325	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.459448783453	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.501761906354	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.498413332282	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.50163032576	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.494410207679	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.488506547245	I like that.
0.0	0.497254059737	She said the truth.
0.0	0.492853126267	Not bad.
0.0	0.339805762083	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.496211067936	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.493883461791	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.510567473134	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.513489553584	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.49262748782	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.512294072827	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.499846893363	And you know what?
0.0	0.501213963902	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.50541377248	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.50546094424	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.495203620878	I don't care.
0.0	0.500068774234	I never said that.
0.0	0.490432306153	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.506803313088	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.48757177476	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.487803753761	We don't need that.
0.0	0.508845990898	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.50498289976	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.490338650096	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.483224205524	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.491450016512	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.498548149339	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.44331711668	No.
0.0	0.501261450237	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.493362253538	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.511909556621	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.50852500818	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.510076600804	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.495022423177	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.491857098976	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.519610047475	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.522647762855	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.489767360489	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.522143223299	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.489246772879	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.494627217857	I got that.
0.0	0.506658443305	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.496371142047	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.500176876087	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.500991779799	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.492221940466	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.505765291115	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.360649448771	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.496758954061	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.497087976234	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.491578185628	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
1.0	0.51908884854	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.487604181531	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.362333243592	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.497536669708	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.495377170072	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.49975694155	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
1.0	0.503744589681	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.49373152795	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.48695426285	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.499425005021	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.501306980786	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.49540209455	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.391236740332	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.509946598486	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.499279797308	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.501171974979	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.497109819637	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.510347543512	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.49962135443	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.493090014936	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.496253520243	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.496943735088	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
1.0	0.507598199915	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.493817279695	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.489807696956	You looking at me?
0.0	0.490346400868	Check it out.
0.0	0.390410656542	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.493895698947	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.503858942714	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.493353332026	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.492584457802	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.523791439652	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.495728166369	My background is different.
0.0	0.499846893363	And you know what?
0.0	0.496389436093	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.489929587278	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.500030035186	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.497211115053	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.454309561442	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.498026767618	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.599235638652	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.489980645677	How do I know this?
0.0	0.503074973055	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.491783744122	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.488398263158	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.488962521	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.489500165861	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.44331711668	No.
0.0	0.515703060152	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.500075653452	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.500896549498	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.503035218577	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.504287010024	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.493178386477	And, we said no.
0.0	0.513032061814	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.506107305765	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.505537200025	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.495187019092	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.495445107922	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.50492058756	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.498180071538	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.48808759086	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.495746419752	And for good cause.
0.0	0.495968513404	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.4900254295	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.499221900368	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.497249839094	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.500854028703	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.501681464956	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.49601234157	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.365240929658	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.478431701997	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.495907501778	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.50280255001	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.49865552599	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.489712640027	It's true.
0.0	0.497397073486	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.49723924994	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.507362648902	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.520051131306	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.492606318161	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.5035680574	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.370715970991	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.491206622066	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.498319670105	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.420285430734	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.497899075706	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.497759381797	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.511082183887	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.445218967312	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.

0.0	0.504303489084	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.506954177704	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.500820639674	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.502830584449	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.500934372628	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.454353659915	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.49431516143	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.487560325458	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.508695542012	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.492582785901	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.504145015778	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.500262372868	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.487545460132	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.49210104805	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.493231013584	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.491382866087	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.495339650649	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.505016115437	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.492789280053	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.496529885486	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.498637260119	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.4995754973	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.394575999831	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.500874105403	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.514372467067	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.44331711668	No.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
0.0	0.507251918104	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.516805480516	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.497941152492	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.401810267426	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.498317526638	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.473040087769	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.498120846448	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.50139402117	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.482994882476	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.485321247322	I think you're --
0.0	0.511125860417	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.505821842217	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.507431145003	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.493480137072	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.489452906511	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.49164791202	You're right.
0.0	0.493994621108	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.49860619409	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.499764622184	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.505926999318	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.496512248463	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.487506019421	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.50512600545	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.497751461088	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.506473537024	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.504318975873	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.48463811183	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.502659992227	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.493939160942	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.499536328146	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.500746128465	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.427403936145	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.500704029221	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.390649321535	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.502691401371	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.519183602509	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.49652436071	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.500845073921	So you know what?
0.0	0.495445394099	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.492611752249	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.500727823631	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.501054214481	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.491962116415	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.494355418573	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.493448369359	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.486964124206	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.494909488472	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.525147016138	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.5001446212	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.339576226717	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.504754013742	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.493056700767	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.492345931086	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.490785033195	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.505028316062	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.511162745053	Of course not.
0.0	0.488137766407	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.517566713139	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.487103357575	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.494843532831	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.500081225555	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.487108805318	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.485245821642	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.494473350266	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.496139590213	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.490719667452	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.494885107068	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.507140254322	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.499265796796	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.490356739681	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.502370262693	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
1.0	0.514899000724	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.495478346392	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.493226004554	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.491281100577	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.500922763503	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.491185032709	That's what they're doing.
1.0	0.581740976437	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.490333885442	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.492100594693	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.495229004486	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.504828035776	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.493809689668	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.49038880683	Divide that out.
0.0	0.494472659	I would change them.
0.0	0.47382361374	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.503580918212	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.337068271156	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.400583527847	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.499490394872	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.510326500542	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.490878979976	I would just say that...
0.0	0.469725654368	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.488606133724	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.484812064484	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.499280897142	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.461201512182	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.494176883018	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.504132403183	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.496168853637	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.498961420672	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.495974389356	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.486836416899	And so do I.
0.0	0.499174633975	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.491734667014	We are not France.
0.0	0.501719916461	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.488259681009	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.477941198197	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.503877126788	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.500890282338	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.4920651786	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.499736878123	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.368075206533	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.527341521287	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.493186332962	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.496546079541	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.500880862434	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.496193007583	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.495586581409	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.492055296081	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.495744277555	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.490424733789	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.503831212015	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.502105711625	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.493712307759	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.499593902054	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.493199652598	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.485401492649	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.486201360363	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.494997755509	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.499069790491	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.497843891221	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.504183149724	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.490046653596	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.48832249148	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.494533299047	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.494563870831	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.492303985484	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.513798686921	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.44331711668	No.
0.0	0.491931058426	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.492652672899	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.488781275427	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.498731615951	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.49703462537	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.492363547536	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.508840469958	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.489230296622	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.495869740814	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.496220061246	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.507609778826	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.490741992685	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.501096542715	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.504691335656	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.487652031936	I'll say this.
0.0	0.491914495921	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.498816564412	You know why three?
0.0	0.493366945213	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.504088608306	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.487081736189	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.501760879239	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.489587643824	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.491306478118	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.500223357526	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.500200128756	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
1.0	0.506834505772	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.483471666058	But look...
0.0	0.495690843736	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.543810593252	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.494273143329	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.501003282138	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.

0.0	0.492389166187	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.499219125273	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.504511631921	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.417417878217	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.509913882354	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
1.0	0.514101621769	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
1.0	0.502994709919	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.492975841453	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.490936774722	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.490908962001	That is what I believe.

0.0	0.490430296535	We have to do something.
0.0	0.500136431481	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.

0.0	0.442210057375	Okay.
0.0	0.487013362342	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.50527981852	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.497229173736	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.

0.0	0.460893544579	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.530437087553	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.497570707126	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.

0.0	0.505627408995	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.500481142326	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.492549451333	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.496801656056	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.487861729806	I will not do that.
0.0	0.506516346486	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.499823870522	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.44331711668	No.
0.0	0.490900448706	That's not right.
0.0	0.496439757242	You count on it.
0.0	0.495304192274	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.494010788292	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.491820400409	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.48559317	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.396751460094	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.495839164215	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.514523766023	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.516953586286	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.495664040844	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.488663362347	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.501343778652	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.48838520289	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.491577535579	It never happens.
0.0	0.393423517801	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.497279071445	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.467889578687	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.517721231673	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.49603907497	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.497470385117	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.49676769789	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.501596771922	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.495288382608	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.498229167709	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.498261669371	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.39772663873	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.497038119627	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.50114452676	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.501513591607	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.502745050071	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.492684833258	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.487919507717	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.49400876113	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.497802481998	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.495510568382	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.5021159641	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.497097625627	That's the difference.
0.0	0.508460568515	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.575312931935	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.492508119363	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.490269968659	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.497742727156	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.497581226425	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.465753580544	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.50093890495	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.5002510813	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.491131085835	Why is that?
0.0	0.498005029502	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.51461025666	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.490341406322	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.370218844947	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
1.0	0.489912482437	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.489500165861	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.496290763773	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.497644732254	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.495102534308	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.501981339572	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.498794177052	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.49328733085	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.421615830225	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.495227641259	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.495343750894	Well, let us level with the American people.
1.0	0.517239598886	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.443517029869	Dynamically.
0.0	0.490294451851	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.535169556231	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.426103377355	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.499305977259	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.48553251942	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.489086184049	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.479107751088	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.391296478596	The answer is no.
0.0	0.493188285478	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.515971858764	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.511870135048	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.499084198638	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.50015784112	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.487365364197	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.507713565953	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.499480413927	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.493326102227	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.496174921734	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.494522720932	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.513043753245	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.498499644984	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.487950363526	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.490039878063	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.507550969288	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.495280268263	You find me...
0.0	0.511890047193	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.387433552463	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.344892933154	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.48544204462	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.483134178134	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.499639023418	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.461071791305	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.497908933279	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.490442154508	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.523326526661	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.520900772871	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.496917886625	You're not interested in an answer.
1.0	0.509858214028	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.493115424163	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.504903676603	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.499368369385	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.481331565421	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.488344085475	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.499135338676	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.49907760334	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.515562825607	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.335253622459	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.494731608353	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.502009652057	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.504374453622	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.498894781545	I'm tested.
0.0	0.502279670678	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.483084622245	...John...
0.0	0.498707702673	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.496471017648	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
0.0	0.508428903071	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.498255159296	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.536505072379	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.488198399229	The number of women --
0.0	0.473398195881	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.490551950102	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.525314186278	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.487583099079	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.49869637606	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.509942076944	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.497386117799	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.487606066301	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.496282721946	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.49843109833	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.515106308752	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.492224425841	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.511745777815	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.502936294765	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.495312030752	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.515331026001	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.501068983088	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.524650559372	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.

0.0	0.49958489233	That never works.
0.0	0.505804362453	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
1.0	0.503884969373	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.4946355019	OK, good.
0.0	0.507349738218	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.490669208929	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.54875520778	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.496927409992	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.492797008345	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.492451204289	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.496030034265	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.481265349918	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.503409998179	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.506805319751	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.496319871528	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.495175324147	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.488397592112	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.50915465538	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.345877616316	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.344567383344	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
1.0	0.506001511015	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.509924992247	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.498259722595	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.500490138636	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.495983425978	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.509139356462	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.488514064763	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.490451835039	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.324446653057	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.494180552266	No, you did.
0.0	0.498676444022	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.510634885058	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.505364328906	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.494955583877	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.50243754631	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.500466508455	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.496730608202	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.493865585089	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.493824685644	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.498343068214	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.494627217857	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.510338990232	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.495206312971	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.442210057375	OK.
0.0	0.495441602185	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.499104927875	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.495631254806	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.325826706314	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.498246030108	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.498911820135	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.490005883903	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.490984060454	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
1.0	0.499544966956	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.497602207161	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.485690172492	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.505319482937	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.496079262413	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.502901177351	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
1.0	0.597473259163	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.509037462363	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.494485788004	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.497572895056	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.501109935743	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.493413753504	We need sound money.
0.0	0.493914139692	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.490128635525	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.49866271721	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.498105343087	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.507261238043	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.506931535843	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.495857575162	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.469612388665	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.518146316396	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.495811647902	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.495959783289	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.508835748279	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.501398642527	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.366196834632	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.493077429516	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.497533358144	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.508193715142	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.499491998322	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.499257558063	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.497794379174	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.333649363292	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.484210421098	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.49673547818	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.394983082156	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.495689103766	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.337966420899	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.489428221933	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.492937074082	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.440369655003	So...
0.0	0.493357378795	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.479882685809	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.499707210246	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.503781688282	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.498250454209	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.496918804667	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.50868310989	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.502764363735	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.469530716845	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.496377074139	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.496506124232	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.506107170343	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.489549432275	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.506585566095	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.504808864071	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.489371336199	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.499709011566	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.504759367671	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.335809279937	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.498781976783	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.498129475796	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.494837065194	I didn't.
0.0	0.491772356455	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.502014401387	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.505958475368	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.503107654147	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.483084622245	...Chris...
0.0	0.514854506637	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.489014951426	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.503844571814	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.503348726203	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.507943115017	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.512779370919	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.442192236842	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.487223316472	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.499286517691	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.495279377654	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.483246049573	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.490411158337	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.491013562159	You know why?
0.0	0.499619513385	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.496345872938	That's not true.
0.0	0.493888105825	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.493185048569	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.528266904757	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.350568939046	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.494886566716	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.489754654546	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.495816947138	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.

0.0	0.497822048279	You're simply not.
1.0	0.446166065676	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.503860127418	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.498936660994	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.495716370579	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.492212390113	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.506514653492	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.

0.0	0.493150223778	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.497706225875	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.510536619842	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.49701389235	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.489630145909	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
1.0	0.529993930312	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.494897174712	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.505445799533	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.508913546681	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.501174830804	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.497183377306	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.495600220465	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.49709946877	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.49695090773	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.443517029869	Right.
0.0	0.503533176851	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.498083775016	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.484722408998	That is...
0.0	0.498338124239	And I make a lot more than the average American.
1.0	0.483060799045	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.499816527907	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.

0.0	0.495830176382	Came out great.

0.0	0.497251691351	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.495088199524	And God bless America.
0.0	0.494696581649	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.498814024476	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.496443387769	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.49869738153	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
1.0	0.497000000971	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.50291895986	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.338268740565	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.512542852278	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.494553543313	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
1.0	0.529503343134	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.495282045994	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.497356298406	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.501900468058	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.472023441162	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.486645111495	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.421924837479	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
1.0	0.50506844265	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.439208775	But...
0.0	0.507893897092	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.490591886684	Think about it.
0.0	0.49035158109	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.513643475835	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.541814962633	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.494693600379	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.48452213342	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.430717532009	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.491106890974	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.498783048555	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.49164791202	You're right.
0.0	0.499376439844	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.490350909551	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.492068078615	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.49643874034	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.353512854077	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
1.0	0.501093295396	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.458004165835	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.502861566122	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.51066632387	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.501173120604	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.496493914979	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.505250130977	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.480624958884	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.494786136623	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.496295248642	A brief response.
0.0	0.522147554666	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.492844400442	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.493862765315	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.51970981995	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.489556389974	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.426899742646	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.495449198601	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
1.0	0.500202747024	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.490267161013	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.493621175113	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.506398126724	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.499935986097	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
1.0	0.536995324175	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.492946328149	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.487345385117	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.523844926113	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.496841557525	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.509094464825	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.48313728304	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.49632800173	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.501349713654	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.507431145003	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.498461329989	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.357616370596	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.509981025647	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.496964487196	That's fine.
0.0	0.364648319661	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.492961113833	I totally get that.
0.0	0.509737665563	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.493572173944	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.497156675078	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.500285065067	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.49380907301	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.391410146195	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.496543598596	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.492163835814	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.492176658661	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.501859880765	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.492744976501	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.498642601915	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.502032064672	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.493136931947	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.365344028326	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.508054230618	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.501416729275	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.491820400409	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.498438076432	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.498644565606	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.489038440543	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.50521527363	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.494121215001	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.487872151565	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.381846174035	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.490815047643	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.490904863163	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.513505313751	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.507234394908	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.493885946423	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.515772954723	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.368373201966	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.496256550063	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.498099237318	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.499833374435	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.498501685283	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.48761875948	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.496434711368	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.489276559681	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.477523641673	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.490766469514	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.499391949461	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.450792553292	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.488483243859	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.497061787085	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.502684842523	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.499193952003	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.502775506005	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.501135261101	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.504016794824	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.497019889034	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.500455027135	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.499872799347	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.513299718874	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.496240367885	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.343306983717	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.440369655003	Again...
0.0	0.496281695838	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.500024141395	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
1.0	0.507259080239	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.507878228288	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.496211152975	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.488873416787	-- the governor's absolutely right.
1.0	0.517997817394	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.440169771643	...
0.0	0.344111829373	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.502381999853	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.507070097792	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
1.0	0.496936539765	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.51427838003	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.429245149715	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.49329990192	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.496776434086	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.502375020175	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.498891975872	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.499835497777	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.506752261395	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.508191289302	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.526847419124	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.494126018066	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.499667770864	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.488561405228	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.506552081901	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.494577936154	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.518044072396	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
1.0	0.51451256042	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
1.0	0.50074800828	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.491563105872	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.492413000519	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.50013176568	I changed that.
0.0	0.502940976848	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
1.0	0.505443254344	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.495319213586	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.506187097097	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.498609366196	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.50859268334	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.506159071673	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.345246731093	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.499963128142	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.383682725508	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.495997568154	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.483784382578	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.48632942113	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.510438001538	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.488595676449	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.486997992069	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.490923165507	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.49049482792	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.487998747233	You do.
0.0	0.497269100889	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.486826231303	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.494757046654	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.496074235516	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.499187171123	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.492120143787	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.46216042755	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.502458271845	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.495290840059	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.495572942275	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.49682639634	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.50599648412	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.494627217857	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.504099118531	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.500152316022	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.486010348731	You just want to...
0.0	0.501037467477	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.495717947731	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.440169771643	Neil...
0.0	0.502024648597	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.

0.0	0.379402211296	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?

0.0	0.490884317417	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.534850678446	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.365784645595	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.390287206614	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.509207218234	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.

0.0	0.499773958265	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.500569276839	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.

0.0	0.504129592045	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.510816787418	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.496941987539	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.476423226763	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.494016901618	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?

0.0	0.495876969128	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.474026316905	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.491263906854	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.507976254237	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.

0.0	0.515176283989	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.463186214534	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
0.0	0.494034682022	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.500217009805	And I ended a federal entitlement.

0.0	0.493660194796	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.

1.0	0.505079006702	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.509218305631	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.499649885475	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.385583837125	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.500580273995	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.498368830153	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.483288492374	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.49559750286	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.513631700928	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.498136461609	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.582120400599	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.

0.0	0.500501568909	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.487536294748	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.389790500362	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.505904071558	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.504737133096	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.493109571436	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.496025380826	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.494623617077	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.490913625319	We have no borders.
0.0	0.490770157035	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.500414495908	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.500828505949	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.491506422398	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.499587494142	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.49670320832	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.496115642249	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.3337814762	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.503576016203	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.51264282564	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.506901986461	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.494199358319	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.338268027312	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.377113310584	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.48995664112	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.489042411879	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.491186822291	You did.
0.0	0.498909288942	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.491607044127	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.497094876959	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.36255611093	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.506207193065	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.49442477267	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.486254132015	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.503169095156	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.498394864455	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.439208775	And...
0.0	0.517298996672	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.499484035834	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.511539719551	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.48697573716	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.492691763423	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.500207503043	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.508971945495	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.500908339298	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.586025317042	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.494642151	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.496805746404	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.511815933408	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.541813419048	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.49796660552	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.502075116009	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.492801608893	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.501956212664	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.526969589424	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
1.0	0.544399467179	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.498926385767	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.497632827793	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.481372176052	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.49344515388	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.496848984551	to save a company.
0.0	0.503014536124	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.494391449382	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.366658145334	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.504402057003	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.49670725663	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.487926184425	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.496597328726	That's how you solve the problem.
1.0	0.493459737718	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.391182926468	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.503852375517	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.497585652787	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.442210057375	OK?
0.0	0.493524126266	I promise.
0.0	0.49117561608	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.498596489396	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.496540385755	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.496057247194	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.502130715901	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.498389323516	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.518774846971	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.503820697981	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.488515158705	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.497946417919	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.387793696033	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.505356246711	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.498830455839	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.497097336734	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.497149369016	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
1.0	0.505356027248	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.525069128022	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.493171539249	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.495659474589	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.498228076488	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.577721286494	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.496237993743	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.49843153342	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.489081293063	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.500621234113	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.507869880718	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.497289781799	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.493614024008	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.503633271132	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.493335918058	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.489273956387	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.482177056689	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.487433492617	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.370525053513	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.522286253374	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
1.0	0.514306659487	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.499656917787	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
0.0	0.506898451645	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.517143125532	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
1.0	0.50347590696	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.507770626489	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
1.0	0.50598497937	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.337886502908	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.509661304131	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.364198352112	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.490600116721	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.501091447859	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.443517029869	Absolutely.

0.0	0.49018072782	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.448673697018	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.49625364032	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.49686970457	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.50274937819	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.495044733585	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.491877655816	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.495297391619	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.436423849333	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.496012098299	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.496700882037	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.546060172524	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.48576322512	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.500813365671	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.503183993877	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
0.0	0.497969616841	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.494976269926	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.500888932073	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.493768039764	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.550106135686	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.404877792202	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.496400237442	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
1.0	0.495322584333	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.4980904367	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.50863427872	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
1.0	0.462465840025	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.504382628494	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.497298241687	We're running.
0.0	0.500811709902	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.497122208973	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.36633241728	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.53504750269	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.486907506525	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.483156648177	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.495906091125	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.495375906328	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.49532061134	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.512942862098	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.509616551501	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.495966781929	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.500971538055	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
1.0	0.500075330256	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.496578111988	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.542715760303	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.494851423041	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.353622010706	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.496315045128	I'm ready.
0.0	0.486940494454	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.510883455622	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.490495989233	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.498401379545	We're friends.
0.0	0.484285594181	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.496934529331	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
1.0	0.511880222416	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.501106900467	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.493283784545	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.517933787816	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.501704101707	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.494174960678	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.498882271162	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.491130198586	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.49883640184	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
1.0	0.49649158682	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.493548992372	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
1.0	0.525979320569	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.508263212635	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.49242664831	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.512395889252	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.502730922924	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.497813793408	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.500199343985	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.492541656273	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.50234378115	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.397562536682	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.492866391095	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.501130827686	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.498983077624	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.489266087273	No, it's true.
0.0	0.515140307826	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.508077863584	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.443517029869	Absolutely.
0.0	0.491504880614	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.499658739582	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.492406220778	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.50061248282	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.493927580817	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.503412297115	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.527452049397	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.472436978238	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.510799031613	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.526372087278	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.509348496537	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
1.0	0.511842109786	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.474510328934	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.483589561462	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.491690725481	They're off to China.
0.0	0.495947189539	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.505666916044	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.500197454397	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.492502705173	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.501451172819	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.499490006219	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.493624418397	I would change them.
0.0	0.500068774234	I never said that.
0.0	0.490359328734	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.390486843064	Do we have answer for that?
1.0	0.512796087618	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
1.0	0.5218922151	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.494737159139	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.489138937128	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.492596067998	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.49551341074	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.522354575407	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.375154967832	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.488828771573	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.485402323612	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
1.0	0.504550532552	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.510172993727	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.503150654593	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.501633031401	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.500369266244	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.492876249018	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.335233947361	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.487044383326	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.489003705348	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.489946173911	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.503985111733	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.493550675209	I've laid out...
0.0	0.487237259888	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.502466792154	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.505274615807	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.496792973684	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.497028829004	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.492858665129	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.500258105076	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.503531328165	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.497625018932	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.498737317731	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.509295956165	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.511041134874	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.492220414902	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.497108869933	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.488990327668	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.503590723252	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.443038226763	Why?
0.0	0.497282592257	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.490051146799	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.342295535337	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.518825138999	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.504446560806	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.498314241731	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.494570849554	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.499187324593	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.500813096661	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.489034689171	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.491460723223	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.507908376266	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.532116760745	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.439911811525	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.498393364762	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.498249725441	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.504219598405	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.357114710554	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.500746658252	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.503833204015	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.503414556884	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.484500671482	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.519291235971	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
0.0	0.499393799893	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
1.0	0.500550831308	They were wrong.
0.0	0.493130527973	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.495483091954	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.490732675751	And we are not England.
1.0	0.50710090628	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.505732665472	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.58820522176	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.499677991649	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.503018028363	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.497529481562	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.539741543464	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
1.0	0.517426567053	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.494941352033	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.574489506121	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.493838549188	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.496385722757	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.490272014448	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.491812076918	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.485602898444	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.498420031389	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.493827386713	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.515891741758	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.495348432378	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.504211588826	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.49446626727	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
1.0	0.498090935223	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.340391244824	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.495192101851	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.502173691016	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.50511555005	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.512507260072	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.500835539182	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.337638734114	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.49569892461	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.495863248571	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.495112149436	He's wrong.
0.0	0.510937394335	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.463371268512	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.504525789278	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.491016235016	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.420465231091	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.521822733131	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.507026563703	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.503079064422	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.492906179968	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.499035962308	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.495113519914	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.512763457018	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.509590339671	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.476674805208	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.494599086625	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.488772815441	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.510690247922	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.490754410492	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.499175508468	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.499716705395	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.507470888529	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.508338201615	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.508459070816	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.4952674076	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.337649774574	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.425122296331	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.496282033026	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.366152316598	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.503335644446	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.493724243823	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
1.0	0.507449980759	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.497463030159	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.496325790746	How great is that?
0.0	0.506947306191	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.531528776401	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.491636167554	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.525161137718	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.488707582691	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.496181629807	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.494069961529	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.492233672371	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.4955612094	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.493950599134	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.512759591114	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.494886566716	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.493851409823	You bet they do.
0.0	0.335109693719	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.491846697884	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.497332510499	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.496798591099	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.490476368874	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.501000950358	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.487042992233	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.494560547618	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.513093068866	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.493703136088	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.513710987505	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.494403280031	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.502608100218	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.488581370296	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.497026145444	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.487695236148	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.498257082209	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.488256386081	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.503159628999	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.49575383829	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.498237730467	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.4928764797	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.497774264477	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.55224108073	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.536543545695	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.505437447075	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.497311463658	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.489719238991	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.494010344018	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.509522454473	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.491806732313	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.502814217301	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.501127080402	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.404398249678	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.503065611952	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.495467385366	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
0.0	0.487658808009	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.394283924993	I was the architect.
0.0	0.496947612329	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.512519921171	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.496081006382	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.521684501809	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.505399811812	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.503458311476	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.49628132683	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.502070220217	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.511381869074	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.488608183072	I like it.
0.0	0.496027655762	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.496885982552	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.501727903053	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.486203076296	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.490884317417	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.490137916559	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.500524823484	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.391808919161	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.512191955067	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.497004838272	He has never defended...
0.0	0.503640613664	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.397894624732	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.501196008858	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
0.0	0.461372065277	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.507344709756	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.504729004811	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.38685937887	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.493646679556	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
1.0	0.517232253639	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.487536294748	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.49844407543	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.411312709053	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.582208203718	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.497318817428	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.369994888552	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.495968506587	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.503931827948	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.496609199768	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.495903632288	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.50803440466	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.493377647625	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.491335064025	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.484973638107	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.505150584641	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.496783484512	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.499772747441	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.503669495477	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.50180013231	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.50215023226	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.517206701019	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.501980219647	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.509805877738	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.491717111868	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.511613501065	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.5099951441	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.490938270872	I agree with them.
0.0	0.496727323187	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.501349713654	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.486896702617	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.48911142052	That has not been...
0.0	0.498644565606	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.499232611574	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.505443104575	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.505329747315	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.440019239434	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.498673919359	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.474010526391	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.48292180052	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.49554793453	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.508940911145	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.498040147524	We're laughed at all over the world.
1.0	0.508609151267	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.522092347793	She voted for it.
0.0	0.494195221496	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.49797845632	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.49533955822	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.498596359399	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.33905636691	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.506410555139	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.4998406498	Just for the record.
0.0	0.495193721821	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.493842590721	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.494386335398	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.491868336956	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.509776428215	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.497706480299	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.491753825282	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.343845235638	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.495088783688	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.504721667264	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.504929691496	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.487998747233	I have.
0.0	0.506396644113	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.524670093801	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.495978470876	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.468600168727	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.499988427291	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.497525545705	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.495090773669	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.495025069579	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.487853653588	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.491922941786	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.49628943196	They're a scam.
0.0	0.483166136222	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.497366038206	We both want to get more revenue in.
1.0	0.51448493351	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.538195877869	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.501618074979	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.486964124206	Thank you.
0.0	0.495390840646	I will show you what they do to women.
1.0	0.509149876759	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.460642615833	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.490316665386	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.497709818357	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.499152387676	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.498292870224	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.490566863058	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.49242028565	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.489189186137	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.341849693204	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.497542960482	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.486454271172	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.491291900226	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.495478911082	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.504890375508	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.50455921132	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.495160919961	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
1.0	0.504045289687	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.510144734694	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.496793104867	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.501086484747	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.367024731136	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.504660115388	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.488492477875	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.495667735509	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.49639965484	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.49099088715	It's not my PAC.
1.0	0.521740607243	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.393578428213	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.498266655167	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.491487434576	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.495037128919	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.496853210372	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.490900448706	That is not right.
0.0	0.509759451542	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.499315688329	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.501667630263	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.50715259614	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.386499363444	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.497880744209	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.491690980651	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.512327870359	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.478190373134	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.493322473661	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.521809956088	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.499031073152	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.496359978008	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.490190778116	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.49741571722	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.500530301783	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.491760246939	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.48900053074	I can do that.
0.0	0.499140854949	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.462109193419	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.493889256392	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.492797216495	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.343557153983	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.498491781028	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.497796876039	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.482448922759	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.491983102782	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.496206495655	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.495362335769	...income tax...
0.0	0.501225394333	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.498083679417	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.490837259789	We're running.
0.0	0.503329040115	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.497996914915	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.498129475796	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.49663635864	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.501122941807	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
1.0	0.498274917635	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.49917688286	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.498464693702	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.336256564273	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.500676652742	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.498889704279	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.507418396375	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.50318156415	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.484078360257	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.494990197125	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.498346627525	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.498192520251	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.491213914455	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.483332176916	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
1.0	0.506493946348	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.49777640518	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.496203089901	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.398115300378	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.493727234509	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.49833502427	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.338989446112	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.489642347275	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.49262905316	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.505128123718	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.339612697796	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.496631734377	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.338914851423	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.49746403051	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.392658788274	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.503660754919	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.500397548511	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.509372520863	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.485805890916	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.500067522391	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.497079722457	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.496492693106	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.494106467803	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.50284822813	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.496957694273	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.518393580588	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.466471903109	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.485302467869	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.50648123488	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.489755661981	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.499432985362	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.504006139853	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.499180304635	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.494045149087	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.491375888901	How about this?
0.0	0.4981548931	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.478978715754	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.497996788507	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.503371037272	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.494807680156	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.57427597219	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.487840654296	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.485666530086	In all due respect...
0.0	0.521148655049	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.497592521792	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.493651624046	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.483084622245	...Chris...
0.0	0.494426608187	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.360734377139	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.519417520698	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.515696753551	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.493156566997	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.494106373664	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.396795800855	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.490319099229	Wait for what?
0.0	0.491130938635	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.495272558445	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.490900448706	That's not right.
0.0	0.487998747233	I do.
0.0	0.50505980672	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.499943522199	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.498044710882	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.509236237979	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.495022604514	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.495484806797	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.485898219894	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.496230215381	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.501337801532	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.516120269083	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.492250308614	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.497235424054	He's wrong.
0.0	0.510504432724	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.368927911191	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.496180506991	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.494876158324	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.493212439581	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.519784858756	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.39560130033	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.496755759928	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.490911786336	No, no.
0.0	0.492514261021	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.495593353503	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.499517997349	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.491855788937	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.49837802058	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.503965722955	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.492529451872	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.489153344375	...Thank you.
0.0	0.49224532701	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.497545806311	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.505383564403	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.491460723223	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
1.0	0.511117491304	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.498149291507	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.490860711287	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.489185991447	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.498927208839	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.493768355025	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
