0.0	0.470952921981	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.221988157364	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.639699737149	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.282812033993	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.195274939091	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
1.0	0.522482790233	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.364098068943	We have a lot of work to do.

0.0	0.174031228219	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.637062101006	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.389618482011	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.594776482022	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.232066880571	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.168252675659	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.182165477731	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
1.0	0.455613754799	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.346648828501	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.295728276235	The people that Washington leaves behind.

0.0	0.369797197124	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.41313705453	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.545497022922	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.124033737161	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.109747394182	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.361748831876	Absolutely.
0.0	0.269954150263	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?

0.0	0.341352338017	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.75164112059	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
1.0	0.477217287795	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.40995320428	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.284666006714	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.331229267706	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.81157341182	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.

0.0	0.259676825122	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.294581487331	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.402007727062	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.280798233207	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.59611837871	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.

0.0	0.504891079233	We came back from the dead.

0.0	0.362113988801	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.194486818479	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.216803862369	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
1.0	0.481208637186	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.340953346003	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.303081434738	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.254524746658	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.494684142555	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.44804694038	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.499349071234	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.0773840581093	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.506144176068	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.290335372874	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.227143584734	And just thirdly, he was so nice.

0.0	0.375593912779	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.310763969488	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.198853429559	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.550303193739	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.407050976922	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.392801721745	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.590586902274	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.483109770021	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.437647002133	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.803158486139	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.399877244226	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.398906624283	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.292193009299	Neil...
0.0	0.198026293069	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.52400733634	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.657421876492	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.467329024429	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.128572217875	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.485293930804	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.344927635805	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.48865784776	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.612833473108	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.355760288219	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.303852164933	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.394777479022	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.343707256035	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.409681051151	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.289249750054	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.45658255293	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.459008465031	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.326692109642	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.366011174286	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.441883638178	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.400647757281	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.499402162601	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.361748831876	Ever.
0.0	0.208468585728	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.170072035944	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.699654379471	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.314772582871	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.357334238123	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.196837195619	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.400900189643	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.208842730695	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.312584745598	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.297691753892	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.390803226796	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.337756942579	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.737892169471	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.622355822286	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.30297500981	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.521707732209	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.121922206546	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.431961590777	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.466355051318	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.394986617584	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.643577001578	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.410362805886	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
1.0	0.868151878284	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.346148655264	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.44810993967	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.573234972777	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.226449540788	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.102743151301	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.4305118029	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.380840404245	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.404333453067	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.344243229859	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.135233911466	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.412657494681	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.3073773805	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.485140760936	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.551952569574	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.61924150157	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.293686913998	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.293583296779	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.429255668208	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.604874125584	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.17731026539	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.494220951402	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
1.0	0.80324281905	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.291087304037	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.457903780416	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.607022139194	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.484691173308	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.161125596295	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.309952869265	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.141268942555	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.284601812942	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.366718786525	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.107449966355	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.323510135884	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.39545864791	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.381134917493	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.430725691137	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.369610545014	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.450043003998	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.262931078353	Wait for what?
0.0	0.294326076821	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.603667134056	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.126177680617	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.323170011202	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.269839515874	That's what we need.
0.0	0.140792613929	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.478715504865	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.0962371624852	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.344689525026	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
1.0	0.535821403509	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.342258343299	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.400905216423	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.211359732741	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.519326644603	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.501807289546	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.467834602788	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.386968689032	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.176912212874	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.340320802953	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.

0.0	0.20935125574	No, it's true.
0.0	0.155162187451	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.327981008703	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.346181766185	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.642056637194	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.408364834187	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.329257040348	Thank you.
0.0	0.533108777112	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.203563141261	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.361146518776	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.351683591559	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.167357156238	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.197606908615	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.48520448454	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.42381611012	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.304940551369	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.399207538406	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.250519226097	...
0.0	0.268591928574	What should we do?
0.0	0.647825741882	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.474696318846	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.181761693434	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.398759575372	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.871232296173	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.123320636098	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.256169211239	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.539468859787	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.346023970759	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.300953163459	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.47472247834	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.47856292587	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.358585864119	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.497725341357	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.385523933608	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.390836300523	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.359159001508	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.465181658136	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.512874833877	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.415867063853	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
1.0	0.637549422162	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.348091755221	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.428719735828	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.650399282672	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.675494327391	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.27633364876	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
1.0	0.746943657607	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.128186623107	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.299796204543	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.19095305375	Now, we're going to blame the people.
1.0	0.145138410467	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.246563617376	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.614409372378	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.379826225095	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.199807733189	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.24998698861	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.65059260595	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.642013010195	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.321589038506	Big difference.
0.0	0.318696991681	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.393829143832	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.560678961112	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.572875899736	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.536263447635	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.251525810712	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.435680120271	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.275138977075	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.111682907337	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
1.0	0.767380078207	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.380461672017	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.246829770636	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.535238538699	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.252141798435	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.18733487958	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.502157600845	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.39252958035	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.359096347121	You once had a pension.
1.0	0.756615551811	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.550968446335	He hit oil.
0.0	0.29143085424	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.528738666242	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.373719034312	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.354334267774	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.661445782236	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.425945613931	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.496072346118	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.496621677724	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.271417142214	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.329967731252	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.504914724484	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.232832823042	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.520705567047	I said no.
0.0	0.647964161512	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.192992654853	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.535842236522	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.564918919441	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.289725668966	I think he is right.
0.0	0.454680330869	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.265835817341	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.152234252687	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.160807107429	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.381412878925	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.416188577573	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.438470527416	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.136683386767	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.306619358993	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.367528447617	John?
0.0	0.695797901767	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.453173467235	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.419435748326	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.565890842322	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.430164621375	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.625663517257	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.248702563134	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.332186086728	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.349974352098	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.35310022763	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.926527231445	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.054519006789	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.154183834941	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.762603390638	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.235165837807	We're running.
0.0	0.520931674089	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.442311841263	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.48767381028	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.4909132962	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.318385036718	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.440131479901	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.383260093952	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.480988097316	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.123012665916	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.41657829606	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.277652563776	You looking at me?
0.0	0.373166882012	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.167732925672	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.975541343571	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.328548648626	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.22429783314	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.241416012554	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.709027209158	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.552840190757	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.38906963773	This is 2016.
0.0	0.631965248104	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.29879606449	His first election and his re-election.
1.0	0.758573376045	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.478391871465	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.344599438491	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.333909385768	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.338573613855	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.714589095044	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.315266343934	How about this?
0.0	0.518786698998	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.160476657534	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.332745509902	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.585844205586	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.285743959596	I have...
0.0	0.286599221047	So...
0.0	0.784296819816	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.468654495227	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.330325294221	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.438459208953	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.440735957908	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.228649840887	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.296529244781	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.31097642397	That is...
0.0	0.376923746657	But let me go back to something that's very important.
1.0	0.682607252372	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.469222763099	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.545508736378	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.352255780199	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.186955489363	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.544155109405	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.277589033941	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.27572578896	It's not working.
0.0	0.421536889864	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.203626789287	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.667052449435	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.22473192157	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.600723566653	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.430067606538	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.0347016650169	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.292193009299	Becky --
0.0	0.1329767284	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.566916386984	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.540931814779	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
1.0	0.534757207871	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.368321376708	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.674227773953	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.320144594211	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.460495472525	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.342954507976	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.473535642475	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.218837050776	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.325955706655	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.788915437671	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.490281655612	No one is a socialist.

0.0	0.15288925397	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.400172409281	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.259801318083	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.432963677498	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.588444793086	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.492542135066	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.329257040348	Thank you.
1.0	0.516353900521	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.140524845372	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.277225662538	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.488919146848	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
1.0	0.574095826144	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.

0.0	0.410924853485	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.366351712758	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.371949030561	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.317077535164	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.576447274518	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
1.0	0.328757547883	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.691309353893	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.276570503196	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.3604241634	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.285654747026	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.257712254361	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.598613699677	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.991955319833	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
1.0	0.464607813325	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.34986857123	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.596165497747	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.536231230102	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.364154663821	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.491353236029	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.167923436788	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.368629916435	No, no.
0.0	0.377164864655	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.481487220931	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.214704648396	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.319611617999	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.345136941744	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.393788782017	It never happens.
0.0	0.279535650855	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.450043480757	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.461211335608	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.278121966929	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.172365908237	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
1.0	0.733850823884	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.567199095293	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.332625186045	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.621088923351	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
1.0	0.469727254884	Very few children.
0.0	0.303157617185	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.176954308785	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.214010782318	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.245314047074	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.368833890762	We're friends.
0.0	0.415437064741	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.529686420554	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.246034805672	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.513760569367	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.393274743503	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.292533820828	Our next president...
0.0	0.53832932121	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.361748831876	Right.
0.0	0.460840278262	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.275459510007	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.349621607927	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.475411403306	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.447270525552	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.279565877968	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.138907285468	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.251526229572	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.371935815656	Not bad.
0.0	0.329257040348	Thank you.
0.0	0.367535151016	No.
0.0	0.3616894041	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.705907682188	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.273096283258	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.282869388444	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.315501510048	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.242220492583	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.535385062759	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.329257040348	Thank you.
0.0	0.648823433413	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.490436258807	That's fine.
0.0	0.221068144706	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.438045156509	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.377643727121	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
1.0	0.48399900059	They cite Obamacare.
1.0	0.135285974162	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.445617446128	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.75591699123	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.504936753454	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.137215995756	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.275149072088	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.421194991513	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.154550782287	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.856576990479	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.607626383592	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.295644365863	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.412743544559	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.37744429757	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.400043302878	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.338578775419	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.817129858942	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.286798071463	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.292572738894	These...
0.0	0.402283902958	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.387555300177	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.546682469368	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.301309336679	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.629669668111	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.470129021256	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.264185651013	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.465109312159	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.454995319636	No criminal records for them.

0.0	0.254695702812	I totally get that.

0.0	0.303966498118	It's peanuts.

0.0	0.388344707179	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.515318447113	You do legislation.

0.0	0.458359752179	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.589056431061	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.

0.0	0.457276882942	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.473207470499	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.616505480383	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.

0.0	0.565179998296	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.277382280744	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.577824111057	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.332599933514	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.256164060505	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.430221609319	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.328254096757	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.191810018025	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.368507713566	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.276136414923	No -- no...
0.0	0.247225539094	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.329583272868	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.353025170699	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.439096922585	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.550334337094	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.612031683745	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.279155051809	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.467979194895	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.36224225521	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.

0.0	0.447996860853	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.379994580576	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.279069821822	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.261049884167	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.428599283541	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.281832479043	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.346625592388	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.29480316152	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.289756394179	Are you serious about this election?

0.0	0.220042445541	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.427869604079	And this summer, we didn't do that.

1.0	0.588105552487	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.692374750283	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.412718522208	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.386690625915	She said the truth.

0.0	0.600925042373	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.345300008922	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.786183752684	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.696912034829	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.

0.0	0.509330700194	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.518398588601	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.

0.0	0.161692434693	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.257391265987	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.357683372945	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.360753995986	I have.
0.0	0.342784675877	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.262964169566	Why?
0.0	0.578704754451	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
1.0	0.570620104347	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.17771256517	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.598876721613	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.350513413663	Let em also tell you...

0.0	0.57827915193	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.344007998003	And we are not England.
0.0	0.606159310863	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.18044934384	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.47855854856	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.393649981732	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.249774402985	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.538132576474	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.702951217335	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.192117249492	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.458516093116	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.465386686027	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.357058444297	We can't do it.
0.0	0.349362501198	And you know what?

0.0	0.471302818462	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.389393637833	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.323772641535	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.474411161042	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.407398258867	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
1.0	0.675704194627	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.518739773227	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.434587097169	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.386366872143	You're right.
0.0	0.438226768029	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.205590887465	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.353859065863	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.255064540784	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.326721020914	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.341094982518	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.24403867344	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.436653952772	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.410293672348	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.331729096545	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.347294747506	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.320574142937	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.3804109408	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
1.0	0.599298271538	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.235531035163	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.247586710842	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.913449639752	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.272173962666	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.47788346015	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.703853875494	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.336971862774	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.540786260729	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.525199524197	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.

0.0	0.319196222505	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.321963614992	We need sound money.
0.0	0.315286132625	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.36965619401	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.407847472771	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.193591005311	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.329160658461	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.465616470889	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.351146973189	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
1.0	0.579848831533	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.428519891114	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.311182723998	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.54921045358	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.217139771776	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.532023670431	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.52578324553	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.503129063927	Just for the record.

0.0	0.224725246392	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.7857053515	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...

0.0	0.570774696464	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.

0.0	0.421206295991	...10% flat rate...

0.0	0.254537006667	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.153291603009	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.536514399277	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.496895248458	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.261719903551	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.498873193204	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.396787586473	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.221607310394	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.459323210571	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.

0.0	0.295061331603	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.152484538686	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.226861219677	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.297490188961	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.123075201686	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.372514550527	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.278793576866	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.279978188788	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.451409640193	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.649013498552	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.534295121862	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.312478362182	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.273455780664	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.397426282349	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.

1.0	0.720739434705	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.505861258815	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.368377599902	No, John.
0.0	0.544926820972	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.362107261526	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.371990815166	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.321393793582	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.231646400331	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.231706189548	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.542378998073	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.351418102003	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.515153457781	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.

0.0	0.461465191878	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.455192846968	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.544102005854	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.245687394403	I know how to do that.
1.0	0.39153552749	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.

0.0	0.274684092128	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.609164739572	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
1.0	0.378520509152	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.294942969412	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.342612645618	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.183779379222	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.739063241405	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.453679753538	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.398047437979	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
1.0	0.584104296515	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.187256667508	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.563126307781	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.401771035163	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
1.0	0.768054444935	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.233663188765	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.165445344266	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.752882676271	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.408130375782	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.455773498901	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.447296445152	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.

0.0	0.423527346968	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.688445794618	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.474632340513	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.198337413192	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.

0.0	0.228422868422	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.142665733574	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.687048916628	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.

0.0	0.162884901877	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.359236532359	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.215514940554	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.547520197075	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.

0.0	0.693283713705	I've got five grandkids.

0.0	0.465276226536	And that's just not acceptable.
1.0	0.65509842705	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.213559292629	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.539100349389	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.510017573109	It's easier to talk to your friends.

0.0	0.141451896319	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.378373396837	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.

0.0	0.703170949499	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.327282930752	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.427174079504	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.240894932451	I like that.
0.0	0.127822044947	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.287189273127	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.297005810453	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.199166883092	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.497750405384	We had Boko Haram.

0.0	0.339303571973	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.435399385996	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.520137088962	But we allowed people to keep health care.
1.0	0.577506842533	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.459567812463	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.415000936078	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.

0.0	0.18665216735	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.

0.0	0.340770714523	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.184955356489	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.298752581864	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.462809078187	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.

0.0	0.20669181424	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.248243220163	...Chris...
0.0	0.318857009554	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.653606225527	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.368116839587	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.281721747353	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.

0.0	0.584328047862	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.299924174527	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.462679893891	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.277201258888	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.463908352751	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.536612922847	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.487296287566	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.

0.0	0.399976748226	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.937853497001	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.823895125954	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.

0.0	0.358749257613	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.

0.0	0.46829471262	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.352052514744	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.317726783865	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.821515473217	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.457821637888	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.245993874939	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.370128390591	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.476966231277	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.395775089279	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.415393140819	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.307163955359	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.264737792258	They are refusing to...
1.0	0.855641355658	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.191759044897	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.172551073405	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.478467937744	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.359438013085	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.370888505123	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.63887868204	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.448896687515	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.207819856143	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.173385622059	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.596668835285	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.346037355956	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.246022255135	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.161595596346	I would like to start with a basic.
1.0	0.555944844245	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.432711334912	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.398765959627	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.634058823416	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.31968435955	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.543723153305	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.49414129121	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.56325983225	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.429634832545	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.209570198115	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.168542113824	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.556013911499	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.791712397239	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.476527330013	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.465806758273	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.725236577517	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.307905472516	Yeah.
0.0	0.334076715636	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.403064845633	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.883828241166	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.499657667741	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.468029146698	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.388607223298	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.980267274715	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.373512356841	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.42080557406	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.375428434693	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.336269083241	...income tax...
0.0	0.229630490776	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.447703403472	On welfare.
0.0	0.422826666924	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.463702820364	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.405757952891	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.215369220509	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.659364931258	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.864222156756	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.303609977201	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.689919318886	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.245308907635	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.67909313591	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.391774818577	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.239427678834	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.238506062503	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.366407254186	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.329678121908	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.318000845114	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.219144069867	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.473144170777	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.263862862824	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.420533859347	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.494608734099	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.30249885395	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.503545585773	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.397593148334	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.342376349661	Say again?
0.0	0.344375489392	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.861797464655	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.5427854281	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.69263045622	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.421904784059	It's their money.
0.0	0.334064798872	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.33915699391	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.226503640248	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.347026227178	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.182060172731	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.563624922909	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.409824556137	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.424383369198	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.37615301859	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.478180471727	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.429569416744	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.289824982885	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.285274028537	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.430119043493	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.200471485788	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.733166791498	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.322400265598	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.35771650804	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.675390812955	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.222626455156	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.422526920211	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.49033716355	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.527169303075	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.562520822537	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.389138303039	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.425285945439	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.740325296848	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.435004080637	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
1.0	0.750023553081	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.363889380987	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.471412485933	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.361893281888	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.478140860853	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.336566203615	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.138177376358	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.31131326019	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.399059370213	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.622966577368	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.326928455068	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.368564403212	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.222032720953	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.439483793938	I never said that.
0.0	0.38920144405	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.370266331012	See, here's the thing.
1.0	0.852314632523	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.667818439085	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.16226113331	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.481521933243	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.29506065992	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.214146501779	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.625663517257	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.404978880034	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.291585106329	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.634719223551	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.598345222286	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.339760532186	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.312027927866	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.409322122229	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.500333004934	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.14394377082	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.399522673648	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.600265587505	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.454960816525	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.241100865184	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.42707034838	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.621422739064	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.427615035494	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.514578843505	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.19566486495	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.281658322131	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.153505009413	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.393788782017	It goes away.
0.0	0.186841369378	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.239874040574	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.580392087113	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.651404450276	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.534119023669	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.741395406103	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.685457749483	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.462788087176	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.405875736205	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.373756087394	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.526000834493	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.24560967956	Why is that?
0.0	0.339073660307	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.273319984433	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.322529142381	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.41708101324	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.341617073755	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.334172497808	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.298001570806	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.355741716346	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.380976615918	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.334395899789	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.280164118544	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.0408967202827	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.340376508211	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.724138654206	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.486426852855	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.214595110293	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.13274174974	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.566581266767	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.334460579956	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.42780054962	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.446899013006	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.378507334544	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.619583453648	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.245463547412	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.60357020104	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.510549997745	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.508340493464	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.

0.0	0.199881828599	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.182929887004	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
1.0	0.67624349325	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.

0.0	0.323687458212	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.366665553167	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.393031352578	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.153151169988	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.32068875099	in particular.
0.0	0.388344382598	It is not a suggestion.

0.0	0.386399954123	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.708263985061	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.

1.0	0.737288254497	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.345946373116	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.397204811257	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.588729937656	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.387215848889	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.507446370013	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.278382905389	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.122570395535	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.3316255491	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.730572175576	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.186528714681	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.559506901091	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
1.0	0.507412716684	They were wrong.
0.0	0.238828558316	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.451525104338	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.281419099832	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.503678723832	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.501859887869	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.361748831876	Right.

0.0	0.473308903743	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.230863708834	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.474844211394	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.540458099201	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.428668561515	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.206064569339	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.21411747586	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.424436636726	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.

0.0	0.208940494551	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.373888688554	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.444260177367	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.52328200336	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.310784935259	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.335855410653	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.392478376196	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.557033267789	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.588961277854	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.348205902325	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.821368010159	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.294906089356	I will do that.

0.0	0.343114437092	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.183844892673	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.413775689311	White people?

0.0	0.337199646718	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.420625371747	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.721889339139	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.155741110008	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.522129378621	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.313511632895	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.736691080656	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.595215424321	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.556665288235	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.510125600966	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.330071169272	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.24063585703	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.186748943866	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.45873432368	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.423654521356	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.705820304474	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.659825890079	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.731771886611	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.32509839839	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.0849018147462	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.315328013477	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.48519093927	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.485479375753	I'm tested.
0.0	0.114676552222	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.435090860182	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.408270728098	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.289875903242	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.305578086601	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.581278544167	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.239826682291	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.715888677573	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.288180366491	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.340626466089	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.20434986331	I agree with them.
0.0	0.436063928517	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.555356480905	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.307905472516	OK?
0.0	0.245674435759	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.191208402628	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.367535151016	No.
0.0	0.442419163552	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.2693904904	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.492179619758	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.17762273446	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.251363021253	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.744495308908	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.280653153587	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.590958737036	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.463778520035	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.314815560714	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.418756429184	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.230346045264	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.207809076436	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0808683299249	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.406962959901	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.444168457103	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.20118563429	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.50632814317	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.34265625395	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.26850502409	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
1.0	0.919118639648	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.0857857971211	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.409644336066	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.87945376034	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.75453834553	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.511359577716	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.741675194341	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.46735047584	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.201802634623	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.519029300326	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.554751733303	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.555385414297	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.253917793167	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.508291862129	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.600151540479	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.588442737618	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.349559255248	I can do that.
0.0	0.561362923368	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.250902584008	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.169910111404	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.647485510311	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.396528389168	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.356473195373	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.307905472516	OK?
0.0	0.490045288232	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.350992871665	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.250353292472	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.42548769778	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.562175086699	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.524957880158	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.115486493113	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.426019003201	That's 13,000 miles.
1.0	0.198155308072	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.160925616466	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.515559374771	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
1.0	0.427733102321	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.647053508847	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.498509254171	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.564346817389	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.18973842391	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.642876054818	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.50932111562	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.485474851184	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.187018899342	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.30954059439	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.253430618358	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.512267070782	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.368550699733	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.719395852852	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
1.0	0.39122613926	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.584315940433	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.201607124581	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.731167522948	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.190297415924	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.266758529545	You know why?
0.0	0.313835739426	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.351465162617	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.117795112775	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.394477230113	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.685578323534	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.455445856612	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.41021310043	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.844998187192	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.458347422134	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.433552588398	You did.
1.0	0.68048927165	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.358559804797	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.495154092447	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.646945064109	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.025636208659	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.291521539313	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.148647260762	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.339666623691	This will end.
0.0	0.300863716908	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.285978866489	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.247792800075	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.440197333892	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.341332019968	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.512926266251	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.262516596188	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.434777383036	No, you did.
0.0	0.189679030916	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.358863287159	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.259325942591	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.316674863902	They know.
0.0	0.487592659526	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.32210278526	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.90878290529	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.473562629725	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.310729520983	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.188297511877	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.293601926835	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.500832546063	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.0997598992672	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.344701363587	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.400517506957	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.642014364879	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.36545767891	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.224070699496	That's my view.
0.0	0.296296039788	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.678580135712	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.367528447617	Alright.
0.0	0.421450705417	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.57087556524	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.490436258807	That's fine.
0.0	0.316465306275	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.535021131934	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.525819407146	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.420038104948	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.494578902981	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.533113543584	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.267344856343	I understand.
0.0	0.201001268727	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.682094992183	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.173438086121	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.332543001632	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.201300624045	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.440272377405	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.562849693014	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.707247925239	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.309244480626	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.332937262781	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
1.0	0.48754410846	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.0490357391006	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.305967080512	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.254633719783	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.651555877691	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.648128550598	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.227787373186	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.673490984679	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.361697720614	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.589024151472	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.625058075821	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.434095883463	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.517263143009	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.3998611035	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.376880769819	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.743494609011	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.298144352897	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.205080815021	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.601353260118	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.288046091744	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.112089021805	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.

0.0	0.979172609099	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.526615101134	That never works.
0.0	0.520938639038	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.329257040348	Thank you.
0.0	0.573042534247	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.41699976075	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.986127103602	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.874106938289	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.

0.0	0.248015127028	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.239361837287	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.

0.0	0.165987831243	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.285331827625	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.170299446447	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.285488227593	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.350868210437	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.262254658418	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.64607604145	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.454114799995	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.350376332991	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.534340423342	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.412497948621	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.311104108471	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.497184449331	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.114878212407	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.504448980223	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.

0.0	0.0883152819975	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.494288099945	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.157212076905	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.542514410542	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.39908177244	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.230786749947	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.504250620675	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.513286860676	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.387500905008	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.337102806846	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
1.0	0.27899008999	He has called him a disappointment.

0.0	0.227854774678	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.424811325371	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.493444824332	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.300242116394	You know that.
0.0	0.345413416913	You really can't.
0.0	0.244575747735	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.185955966143	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.538174425575	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.437918608472	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.357030787037	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.361742442776	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.150645749912	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.203577150332	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.373744026385	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.499225464929	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.209895907581	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.47698377233	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.197535747164	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.415124440918	My background is different.
0.0	0.438496323885	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.462219330811	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.188232316239	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.473559743029	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.270426532002	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.257525830854	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.174133058396	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.419075352726	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.140381650592	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.235426582627	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.440263085402	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.51903689074	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.479631553527	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.623224321299	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.343920532645	But I would add this.
0.0	0.256849224806	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.481984880525	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.171540529561	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.464216940605	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.644342316791	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.372501718987	That's what he is.
0.0	0.259872034693	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.467766422927	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.469490367559	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.211381017136	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.356891073415	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.509779254262	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.246549185994	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.718880328774	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.515217275501	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.364390618213	It goes in the right direction.
1.0	0.739987236879	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.314528619858	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.416977963512	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.465544775302	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.167277336751	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.560962751483	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.612138468973	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.560962751483	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.327012991389	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.352400409145	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.442698101319	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.481584954131	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.213723265118	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.623853308755	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.571169520883	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.250519226097	...
0.0	0.425743987995	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.290808760296	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.491605683742	They were wrong.
0.0	0.242950095665	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.276539180329	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.320604408733	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.64019715878	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.397139187921	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.312732895229	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.399391658112	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.30754125629	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.216604964823	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.677038993193	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.397658637956	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.773713433202	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.139024624497	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.22131718259	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.261908483957	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.461183201072	She was right.
0.0	0.257990840885	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
1.0	0.473742601996	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.330577173825	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.729823154046	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.40215646161	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.338572494181	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.368052954902	It is.
0.0	0.504788618973	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.145088351642	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.276537108143	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.325216303215	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.177044434056	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.496739668763	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.438137405525	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.323642040757	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.304382490918	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.325823191411	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.308299442768	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.518411256705	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.23362450451	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.426617058287	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.174366153079	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.522669632486	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.363554503841	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.351371129745	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.373022859956	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.511950680666	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.413880659896	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
1.0	0.661679369501	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.46760992744	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.352379761994	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
1.0	0.557736977718	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.45733555054	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.206236576788	And...
0.0	0.395580851326	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.287324234111	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.225257442482	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.532949139252	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.386602521948	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.526590248773	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.503575293477	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.904776804614	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.268421384507	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.269779671704	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.359078137786	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.113346418937	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.547712507783	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.151001824992	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.384676452401	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.454867384439	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.488834974011	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.315434166681	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.481206428837	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.84214076066	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.144826238885	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.515788336034	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
1.0	0.774918355533	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.440886577365	That is important.
0.0	0.408840888316	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.676303329485	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.259897163	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
1.0	0.553873792376	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.628950186647	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.413374041499	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.325976018227	And God bless America.
0.0	0.458205989452	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.220730398377	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.427176329454	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.828164499711	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.345327019072	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.234409728609	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.395924491576	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.517179244258	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.301382356812	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
1.0	0.546376922074	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.675487682015	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.422047876459	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.178777088049	CRUZL But I will say --
1.0	0.911102168726	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
1.0	0.411355684652	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.62010185993	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.502334618136	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.367535151016	No.
0.0	0.430646315256	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.382726214914	So you know what?
0.0	0.648713357923	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.170800526592	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.307299445829	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.388567974093	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.454349644828	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.471411386727	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.430067606538	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.487176878885	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.307905472516	Yes.
0.0	0.387244923174	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.254975650302	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.205658115591	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.164925082134	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.53549120423	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.494295262454	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.116952401642	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.58907419369	Of course not.
0.0	0.439520996882	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.354986417853	No their not.
0.0	0.349460670972	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.277602585708	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.359806698254	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.343075452743	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.397542681593	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.37450859135	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.282240213025	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.877422762675	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.859901002528	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.230509536092	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.122035898897	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.644530882948	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.448526194632	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.905445033122	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.360539656655	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.792949234002	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
1.0	0.427543630341	That's wrong.
0.0	0.595772994423	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.556848455957	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.617456041327	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.248542001778	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.35015968423	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.309832355337	I don't like that.
0.0	0.117506429304	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.471661856887	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
1.0	0.531892307972	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.74974450826	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.248779549289	I'll check for you.
1.0	0.637897614694	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.307905472516	Yes.
0.0	0.941410264295	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.394216237317	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.334295747813	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.383108587535	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.487799260954	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.439483793938	I never said that.
0.0	0.367535151016	No.
0.0	0.429143684683	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.23046522841	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.26079896361	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
1.0	0.562080167864	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.450821571085	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.194867686437	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.414384907694	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.764799601995	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.43307205804	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.555644482556	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.483316664518	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.703250321047	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.841353099341	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.339662904392	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.428588089633	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.771091497766	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.511947270476	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.413555743744	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.280287656378	...Thank you.
0.0	0.329235289452	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.163403206335	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.427691770515	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.413060567718	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.148202956718	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.233311014614	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.368885133538	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.572677337978	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.45782048296	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.424366347018	That's not true.
0.0	0.564586848288	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.188808625655	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.415803278075	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.267551544515	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.438104103182	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.114317492583	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
1.0	0.741395406103	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.459369345497	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.292668636922	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.241206120563	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.524422471067	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.370601049213	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.585786180977	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.812319684331	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.194715598847	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.598900462673	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.771223233135	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.57172193146	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.464476611287	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.258098443421	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.432287581778	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.344848496504	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.644234026975	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.587583230984	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.314825614417	So you might not.
0.0	0.227952527754	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.416107963715	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.361748831876	Right.
0.0	0.354010352174	You don't have to.
0.0	0.457166521067	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.315452498538	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.197050067939	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.569407297602	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.736691080656	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.527857085056	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.265436510846	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.410312860791	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.294166452174	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.353883502849	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.46093862208	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.325955706655	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.471664896981	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.440616866021	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.407066318724	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.475094312199	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.265880262707	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.183650024378	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.81342225562	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.237949136465	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.241882702542	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.640175002036	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.0981797696538	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.219398789876	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.148335418228	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.427447809805	Good at email.
1.0	0.818378412577	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.31088941946	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.209520009999	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.375027398246	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.277609573304	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.65387918592	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.484052427368	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.39344919134	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.814026430233	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.457249692379	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.242531130385	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.337459100178	I can.
0.0	0.390377439095	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.668369441631	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.386438500466	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.238247700439	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.401773347037	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.489531569192	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.514936445888	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.185523423141	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.621262874262	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.436317378448	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.355995420055	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.644586661309	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.375138492947	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.287270280308	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.1537049207	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.883067560238	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.263059575782	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.0519486138592	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.707137992062	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.447964606808	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.432965059062	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.158307318331	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.520173001503	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.444400638278	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.519689173629	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.472933269689	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.405577517417	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.292551306141	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.508424727255	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.487658195056	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.247738018021	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.323744603811	I've laid out...
0.0	0.632923585227	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.685187272747	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.101208100351	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.526255298839	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.462030919309	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.658112825103	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.457633704941	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.397161699284	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.577667601353	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.262373241125	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.378726891064	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.663487374608	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.529607320175	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.666709572966	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.236454096207	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.405987669102	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.0939331334271	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.826122487936	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.123971381402	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.262798494019	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.399380956673	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.167346303102	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.298593366017	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.383580357527	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.15918587972	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.561855361121	Two points.
0.0	0.448552099191	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.631547225583	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.112460418873	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.296161796816	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.438435721929	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.64241181229	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.145988206869	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.319163884771	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.359010948259	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.278049453235	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.545459476909	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.53849618279	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.2203582069	It feels different.
0.0	0.368912962006	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.319452504571	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.232124109167	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.359415255462	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.149869452603	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.49245418027	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.539560575434	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.632883697131	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.317258770571	Think about it.
0.0	0.414943261526	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.445055150164	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.558634004048	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.352978117103	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.374414232356	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.506237622285	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.23399117143	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.290587927736	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.340443776397	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.344445504392	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.364935916624	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.434336869737	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.228863170326	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.223557974403	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.358523673258	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.367535151016	No.
0.0	0.125345947069	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.395285554123	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.420510513489	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.506367480316	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.204351823863	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.457991439165	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.276818060979	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.176953436314	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.134552573548	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.691344881616	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.396946165715	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.408367879745	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.555651476135	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.249612172691	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.547374831638	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.547521474482	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.389101923074	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.341974146989	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.308143247779	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.462293315459	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.489995961494	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.964273653944	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.56479950143	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.200392355815	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.309192847638	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
1.0	0.473537792674	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.10179098663	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.137486631535	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.495641046171	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.0637407560112	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.504917432424	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.446552878303	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.458192937682	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.481284360277	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.449402068203	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.578401351701	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.539159295048	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.472958954796	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.413208962853	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.707850839839	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.379047600774	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.326621768363	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.281858338635	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.432164053226	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.202500175923	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.358062819832	I win.
0.0	0.261719903551	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.628150988563	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.366987812412	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.644712169151	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.408371595943	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.519632524838	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.351896729491	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.347523713759	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.309379923435	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.36364467791	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.446452472602	We were wrong.
0.0	0.175320303223	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.490201647619	You're simply not.
0.0	0.290759520216	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.376297038187	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.584023665085	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.418323145253	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.501000809759	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.409439071021	That is not right.
0.0	0.404998702115	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.521786835175	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.598880156492	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.438411076026	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.375138492947	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.563564201027	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.255073923617	You bet they do.
0.0	0.329257040348	Thank you.
0.0	0.588908215781	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.445103958409	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.422755291794	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.241730208115	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.679559952644	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.654901650893	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.429320207757	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.675390812955	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.422533595616	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.475141423103	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.262649113186	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
1.0	0.591678463412	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.764696097875	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.377045086495	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.270288818003	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.0401729088191	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.541839569588	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.291574996706	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.539756894765	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.208842730695	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.355724173555	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.396518739063	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.515943575546	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.202416044224	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.255042394115	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.307249338952	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.0383470688514	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.19067935409	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.354406773005	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.60218302956	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.488900677691	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.635231768701	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.375942444357	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.439483793938	I never said that.
0.0	0.642182951188	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.397186722201	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.131493276179	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.442917791082	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.609103207661	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.458041151453	I know every one.
0.0	0.432214073896	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.407774277525	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.525635390573	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.444116383857	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.192520720275	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.553263235792	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.0856670914115	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.307411461609	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.229217952183	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.784658778379	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.155725783217	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.354675449006	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.635515499794	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.341726872178	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.515976957859	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.147224700504	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.623213140042	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.481916437003	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.557176653899	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.624560624605	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.295370761567	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.373679788888	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.476334401734	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.493235420059	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.284780732912	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.405884659101	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.227222751368	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.397542681593	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.375138492947	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.526078613671	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.320038153752	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.531064010143	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.334403667117	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.457059696101	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.353728841653	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.450567860872	Both served.
0.0	0.156678168882	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.469817052462	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.422450191285	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.704485886443	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.31636420127	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.31605545092	You're welcome.
0.0	0.212507836142	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.322682056709	I love China.
0.0	0.673388614543	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.459736734134	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.764373928208	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.241983000002	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.266179992428	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.228080279542	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.282742670024	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.21748485544	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.518205774244	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.313043176203	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.397867510712	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.257395028149	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.504753030294	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.15733948765	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.175734984847	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.350963937265	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.349362501198	And you know what?
0.0	0.385400728141	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.172988818295	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.640844689398	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.312097548522	We have no borders.
0.0	0.408258025427	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.482187021118	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.59717120771	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.420924587409	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.191376633498	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.16470396759	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.526888159505	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.328580869316	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.220823475742	The number of women --
0.0	0.368954657301	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.461183201072	I didn't.
0.0	0.349362501198	And you know what?
0.0	0.446745181391	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.533252356221	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.331272194025	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.328029148977	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.362308711157	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.41298295778	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.144916603563	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.428350788459	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.190864704291	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.400312230271	You know why three?
0.0	0.283560629285	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.447086223889	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.785997397771	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.36422236909	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.386084247202	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.47123419972	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.90427509086	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.273213034837	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.214411578732	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.566306573927	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
1.0	0.440743526622	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.502606742677	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.426466102244	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.405217921113	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.48167151868	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.202827594018	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.412229958966	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.498591626438	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.352457007951	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.206780131391	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.639052444173	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.448301465827	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.295826437996	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.141864544308	In all due respect...
0.0	0.471604343698	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.256590536554	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.372597406974	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.541483233506	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.166071660054	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.185105247518	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.340705329846	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.561624815253	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.317258770571	Think about it.
0.0	0.315536433569	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.390618856533	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.394821471161	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.406510578564	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
1.0	0.508639907268	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.203689028679	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.397607622684	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.442234368296	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.401367598593	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.645728061766	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.571856405909	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.168060719768	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.560441274334	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.764856630884	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.408987762609	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.219244676631	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
1.0	0.342418716783	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.500177411592	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.521605036172	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.497292433397	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.327908167934	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.360753995986	We do.
0.0	0.44063264317	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.685025542556	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.605918796471	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.590790930663	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.450696752697	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.234966939666	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.0886922806555	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.717136307512	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.74506272703	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.309395848491	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.526183011302	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.56342948182	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.461409982394	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.261245888122	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.258653954152	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.197172582593	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.2038417417	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.277042303791	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.629351767395	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.257432725264	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.410270212921	I've done it.
0.0	0.151590138905	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.3568424109	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.481554513329	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.364890553286	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.310035685522	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.478382052642	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.297533226425	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.43206819037	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.320467230929	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.179277463831	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.573605307143	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.474579556275	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.526282921288	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.511208196054	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.303148518576	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.207622191319	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.272941470988	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.460023339606	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.319781294007	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.566384410963	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.329466911279	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.142479165121	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.434594855471	You have to lead.
0.0	0.264655662948	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.903709586162	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.0381041447518	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.206695257067	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.56300766186	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.52587421423	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.185194126043	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.157456631378	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.426804384021	That's right.
0.0	0.46652050579	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.419037119309	We are not France.
0.0	0.186841369378	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.270816900848	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.446640007858	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.253695954522	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.421510091139	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.666316906131	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.72198358657	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.133031254427	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.393690163587	They're a scam.
0.0	0.515361461901	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.270455958265	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.399325833206	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.594171429229	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.539354047719	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.586454444187	Number one, you have people in this country that...
1.0	0.953279383016	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.315907925783	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.496511426349	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.433552588398	It was.
1.0	0.522517228613	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.48753178265	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.69916804675	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.502859757292	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.287175692686	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.424893794297	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.540343277064	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.512462685083	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.277569581773	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.394125781128	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.341966847552	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.525234960186	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.354990009944	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.868746915424	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.352587673351	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.44665150456	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.169931967145	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.439106621926	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.623060964674	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.058444022341	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.70775549928	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.566728744183	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.34949613424	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.408798813633	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.42686431914	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.526184649226	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.500346935266	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.819089649366	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.248243220163	...John...
0.0	0.467319214121	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.308878638043	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
1.0	0.710804912786	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.879209128674	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.115269482324	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.357327742247	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.302105157582	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.184610847942	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.382737737076	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.578069648851	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.493415866885	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.444513482657	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.299318055501	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.389792492291	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.308353437518	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.470285035175	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.488971245356	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.417620149167	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.666606783206	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.348228895049	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.389227137683	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.283675882759	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.436895272465	He is a good man.
0.0	0.279379122095	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.448072114655	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.35318484713	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.187771852508	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.498090859104	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.307905472516	Yeah.
0.0	0.36913195374	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.250195153312	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.444491259644	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.704091477429	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.758198894986	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.572022398622	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.358518048371	(inaudible).
0.0	0.369575058581	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.643622126038	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.398374025808	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.379285193399	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.599973539865	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.497612519272	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.470282227123	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.232398533776	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.517728996816	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.330057215119	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.0948138146492	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.314456691887	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.374357619066	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.477258436446	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.351356063295	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.404911621435	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.414209655543	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.254561238128	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.380435379294	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.379285193399	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.355913075703	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.156522299848	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.192864645107	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.675974230818	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.194502058132	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.367800925897	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.334359020286	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.4210906912	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.262946329262	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.251373366942	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.414782814951	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.367528447617	John.
0.0	0.485634669926	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.390583445269	I got that.
0.0	0.339177085097	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.45743592321	Two quick responses.
1.0	0.621804784335	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.374245802625	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.946967381032	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.261176682756	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.402177055722	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.485961025493	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.216757488939	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.390328616162	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.209039934697	It's true.
0.0	0.442353994897	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.519323083169	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.400312230271	You know why three?
0.0	0.316316431143	See?
0.0	0.354879400732	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.465054416186	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.480530251348	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.190799452098	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.288786544585	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.542933920537	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.341504502672	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.343022868445	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.217211781291	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.436037992638	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.640046007005	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.476418331538	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.348539850125	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.62079371537	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.406245199966	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.524613505115	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.19027460577	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.358208729081	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.458071568077	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.79871830846	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.350834719337	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.128205738467	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.382013383411	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.354347441488	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.202698345442	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.0598332668099	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.534581608236	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.59930147554	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.721178602185	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.538699436495	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.387964717876	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.367490445295	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.397407458971	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.239610829319	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.224496891321	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.434630408893	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.276481467268	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.184998611475	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.593547896509	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.379704875901	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.

0.0	0.621191959296	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.230880127415	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.423128798486	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.108323088105	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.169725979678	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.559164151687	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.

0.0	0.305038635321	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.173025818992	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.414064059286	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.296638722914	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.371689463794	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.

0.0	0.496583531345	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.181002008237	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.325789878073	Or somebody else.

0.0	0.570229151439	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.252787482671	He undermines it.
0.0	0.0909499659493	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.

0.0	0.37598945612	I support NAFTA.

0.0	0.312402713271	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.301833272884	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
1.0	0.582255801178	Mossadegh back in 1953.

1.0	0.375823697553	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.757764848307	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.395100090648	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.239790172356	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.322008567497	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.463106301132	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.385914508209	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.329168854182	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.24106799756	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.149963734329	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.177682292269	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.421200204491	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.491117677532	They're a scam.
1.0	0.712312688108	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.350580478039	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.448630302569	That's my bill.
0.0	0.318817649935	I will not do that.
0.0	0.434638059831	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.434072733923	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.288650567496	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.303683703881	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.330295526298	You can have him.
0.0	0.155915619429	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.25810711808	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.43788571357	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.153658921865	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.250942255274	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.101663604226	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.445058623897	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.39124354132	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.198807987423	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.541767470487	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.485319463616	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.303979763124	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.640037013322	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.363825825294	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.641151675607	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.43681379841	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.325014961007	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.268297493152	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.03572910922	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.179541584901	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.540837897027	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.465581899437	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.328631375471	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.396563423044	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.28395954126	And for good cause.
0.0	0.324704603051	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.368574165813	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.250888824822	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.462751380749	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.271309183475	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.496407507568	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.438975819622	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.496010403485	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.592870430319	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.16805475348	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.424982917986	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.575742102468	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.247581576365	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.319541416773	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.456152925584	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.531749467853	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.494441121426	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.55507622295	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.313662704699	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.207809076436	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.28038375716	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.167854069519	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.330884979458	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.14101193785	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.235199807738	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.496242454784	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.688470350739	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.23736397732	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.462747723444	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.227344295903	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.370989831717	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.637511080679	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
1.0	0.951857450243	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.386366872143	You get together.
0.0	0.355893619456	In addition to that...
0.0	0.406750073027	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.306651487571	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.477654819718	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.409416448602	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.307905472516	Yes.
0.0	0.272748347702	...before I go.
0.0	0.458071568077	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.306636116766	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.237021482602	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
1.0	0.68446615899	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.265476432204	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.467428563164	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.487585158694	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.456123349226	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.232171593028	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.66632937479	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.42649014328	We actually did it.
0.0	0.334927993728	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.374954921129	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.296917776215	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.304734191253	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.110361592751	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.432655656762	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.320663051429	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.225119647302	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.493873302714	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.250519226097	...
0.0	0.386455714909	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.386413922759	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.421885195171	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.610124031419	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.2157651805	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.426767826965	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.263821318097	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.329257040348	Thank you.
0.0	0.407923435551	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.230989332108	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.416616498146	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.54776021716	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.29482467587	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.367183239823	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.237384149158	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.225559585825	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.426934533554	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.437501620177	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.374031452496	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.189425510682	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.376039722884	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.167639266163	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.232401136874	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.518117750125	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.273620593524	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.360984912858	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.500516983454	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.256078121641	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.369773429009	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.751141156557	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.613761173781	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.333841463031	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.472449694937	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.218388585078	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.381494425509	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.369964920657	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.68109715607	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.80467809374	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.710541819558	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.233665106401	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.255655192547	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.267656215522	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.225768536235	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.300144446689	You count on it.
0.0	0.699231434936	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.506032576909	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.225303599237	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.551796973667	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.598582421894	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.3720755083	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.477427520808	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.569991098891	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.708874690804	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.328141849684	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.170982916921	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.383740055429	He does great.
0.0	0.448838438728	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.298856910823	I don't care.
0.0	0.484794306522	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.445343775259	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.254725024015	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.297052176381	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.35363085993	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.293084515228	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.344878888018	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.493998955336	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.453234311267	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.198932655863	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.252835077382	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.23314792418	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.798564576192	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.489544677323	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.280744252397	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.274731829908	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.276688446796	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.382680451889	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.761397619533	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.624381806954	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.143365937599	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.306721547831	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.158991304687	And here's why.
0.0	0.409439071021	That's not right.
0.0	0.391431479742	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.253328216202	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.147523358458	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.347221199953	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.0492364134235	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.190986432945	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.300282784744	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.347681127497	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.361221854572	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.279259427136	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.673541731531	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.67167643061	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.58690473998	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.329257040348	Thank you.
0.0	0.414443285961	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.318227012447	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.351940710094	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.487021398319	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.909143337414	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.379236730872	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.19772722113	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.521429638755	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.369396781685	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.494406305616	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.394998006415	to save a company.
0.0	0.801856554801	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.248476694268	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.491595118963	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.763545527241	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.787864136621	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.351714452248	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.383449669134	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.317464126891	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.167045952456	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.375307064898	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.355018480671	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.192285307633	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.390005760245	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.195541414664	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.253629398838	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.740274835933	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.367535151016	No.
0.0	0.235666941504	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.172120712361	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.438443712643	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.392759854322	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.43475337719	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.393717016195	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
1.0	0.583687208264	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.249178343071	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.333697105386	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.385440750891	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.326465336897	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.356414904549	We're running.
0.0	0.343445411481	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.472385133542	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.354959156666	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.315421515258	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.449130945019	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.175689902816	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.259855975801	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.349362501198	And you know what?
0.0	0.446049640438	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.483811896199	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.608880711665	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.143929918645	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.401362087216	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.456764937723	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.307315800102	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.417139168629	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.343705522694	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.578151696433	The world has changed.
0.0	0.589313229143	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.375953787843	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.218452021645	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.259359803944	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.253715037691	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.632064349992	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.388507774966	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.295592885806	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.259177222124	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.344822004596	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.190634992726	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.38815380159	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.476839514509	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.393726490862	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.628746078062	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.385570131054	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.343331661105	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.336524125928	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.430915258358	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.771194368397	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.140186543566	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.507068775998	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.3675715996	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.276609662279	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.628882583042	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.488603774147	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.318816598714	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.488167172906	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.368385616388	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.623081705997	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.615664396343	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.465383831424	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.58105591206	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.452912072614	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.477739219331	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.183003058507	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.443628059165	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.167434257221	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.330417105473	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.31151208892	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.483036378529	I was not at all.
0.0	0.374224727406	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.795896115364	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.365023100751	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.244520555015	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.396222083906	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.322428386053	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
