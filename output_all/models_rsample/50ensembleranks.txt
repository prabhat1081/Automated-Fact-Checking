0.0	0.824743181334	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.225499107791	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.

0.0	0.415108272563	She said the truth.
0.0	0.338961791756	But I would add this.

0.0	0.427311128091	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.343021868343	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.415750868049	There's a big question mark on your head.

0.0	0.428648162808	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.438701499476	We will work with our Sunni allies.

0.0	0.455315562823	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.595748578912	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.625828674695	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.

0.0	0.49359149305	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.544767757649	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.178758179919	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.

0.0	0.224798776521	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.497128730137	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.492501135775	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.320479273464	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.69957149512	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.756789771847	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.405444530419	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.817581834717	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.440935066763	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.426189353889	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.248638951034	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.250412808788	We need somebody who can lead.
1.0	0.59511826558	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.238764541017	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.

0.0	0.377696738454	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.273522880431	And so do I.
1.0	0.784362502521	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.690118833349	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.306551808829	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.916532676637	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.608661094657	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.

0.0	0.450886731881	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.500060682721	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.231177846015	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.353497003761	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.50336337654	That's fine.
0.0	0.202910637665	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.477391258651	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.421350083353	Our country is being run by incompetent people.

0.0	0.325111662146	I've laid out...
0.0	0.419275690244	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.230184662298	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.260291768516	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.578400257166	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.4405394701	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.480018292391	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.127755274216	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.36207331061	...income tax...
0.0	0.292617550716	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.245775369519	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.26311014948	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.33206721472	You can have him.
0.0	0.196726774174	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.385100622302	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.239900502646	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.367489916541	Right.
0.0	0.552320321338	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.336388678875	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.51585099365	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.460993748842	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.171959562268	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.184422495126	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.622806779926	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.522957999048	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.353253412682	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.653669724824	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.25764991454	You find me...
0.0	0.122227045677	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.728313943778	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.394768483888	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.243130352134	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.426814975065	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.336029623319	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.657368947764	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.394416432155	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.331716348323	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.458247824977	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.279198813503	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.332306216679	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.408537423002	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.314605675341	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.813613794089	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.39757868532	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.305944774963	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.454063121293	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.900431604708	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.387292852718	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.384268593816	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.544303692329	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.420793506168	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.357597444462	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.761625505745	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.270711312136	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.408988020427	They're a scam.
0.0	0.22727471963	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.290618448333	I have...
0.0	0.810853904138	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.327616954325	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.237008386608	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.453944614151	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.195872833941	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
1.0	0.51328978332	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.549879766099	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.359113131411	No their not.
0.0	0.579163774841	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.564284436471	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.492969056581	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.481508314597	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.307478286862	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.279860779288	I understand.
0.0	0.356775266684	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.367207265515	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.377524581614	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.413040122418	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.346135046115	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.20152163255	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.618549598473	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.0843576215651	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.691605879076	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.19683712904	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.614294986228	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.415647583777	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.402733851606	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.541903960068	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.348197481359	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.433979365142	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.289590787141	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.549904774283	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.252731576161	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.566519782359	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.646775264327	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.339926383757	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.36804787944	Yes, it's very simple.
1.0	0.5968366354	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.378811342415	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.24924216199	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.445877069661	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.640109948363	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.481640582594	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.249120872048	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.825776876102	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.448233792995	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.502886121819	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.219313313691	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.406856016072	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.628742473141	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.396193252776	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.400131360627	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.696382030442	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.475661402338	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.485990837168	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.406363251868	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.26854794034	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.269451089786	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.447324775385	He is a good man.
0.0	0.641543041225	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.248353698921	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.313616589467	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.273596350574	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.678798282786	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.255771816899	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.18321430345	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
1.0	0.58124915801	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.433017417991	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.170226501743	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.344652838374	I would change them.
0.0	0.755738891198	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.755109433648	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.319105015428	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.377101396371	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.344213455975	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.319564397009	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.400413380072	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.722468588378	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.543492995131	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.476753758599	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.430963208979	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.543683648125	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.294995323219	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.498567863637	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.330849646463	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.383691722505	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.495728679732	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.289592319075	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.4812964333	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.614791882158	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.309876793659	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.357131115684	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.370545924263	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.874604031713	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.362468395716	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.523971329882	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.411684360587	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.114973146434	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.765309834424	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.174695340917	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.464442312292	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.94537200162	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.186377242055	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.593704651724	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.170125861487	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.126730231656	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.468626492558	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.544172218064	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.480018268669	They were wrong.
0.0	0.275645875953	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.353061397322	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.259905568623	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.251162529088	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.2876557765	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.243769804113	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.132198063882	And guess what?
0.0	0.157973395803	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.29922284091	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.12853071497	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.612015966994	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.42597198001	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.757940000922	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.505220826606	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.609489741842	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.50420060864	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.654718430993	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.329982351606	I love China.
0.0	0.976132393576	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.403435669615	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.176596700182	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.383146865937	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.496630006174	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.15908874302	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.407348956942	Nobody can solve it like me.
1.0	0.424460331815	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.69963949345	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.322284633127	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.792924748114	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.236666705181	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.287172092801	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.339765884056	Think about that.
0.0	0.556301707344	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.406626019691	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.82681759272	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.554373154207	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.485723504649	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.413406830005	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.410777291244	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.348425797079	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.239044374068	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.280307438979	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.446717829896	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.404793687687	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.235998639552	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.577446348896	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.266123877949	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.472596232013	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.519035753572	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.200277050531	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.242812799411	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.45897382009	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
1.0	0.132198128964	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.510988251362	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.572849058554	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.451827060468	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.314259862944	I will do that.
0.0	0.351118779967	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.648079210138	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.441178088005	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.427641090748	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.641343809369	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.358394262845	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.0426263094864	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.762498266813	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.413150180595	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.4082312965	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.138098533478	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.719557784794	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.255785046803	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.451600713952	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.229766895095	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.455064116164	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.370947367669	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.204209409984	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.368624879289	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.210974367955	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.569577194233	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.489538886519	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.175648282569	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.236362245926	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.522805241834	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.574937676288	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.397481462423	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.34867426887	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.46325834765	Both served.

0.0	0.461760937068	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.578182606441	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.468532701784	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.484369538792	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.265059436424	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.264397278965	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.458353609142	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.562934328606	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
1.0	0.310858670624	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.

0.0	0.288956771603	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.252433028835	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.273855617205	You bet they do.
0.0	0.614276551965	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.

0.0	0.436062394663	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.239024734021	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.358917094622	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.5900940266	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.584330915396	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.60962224671	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.239065842415	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.

0.0	0.557518299357	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.284605637615	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
1.0	0.783346787532	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.735376899666	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.275645875953	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.20075902814	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.358238836928	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.51780743346	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.576675192664	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.474078259173	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.55246697984	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.400219959609	It never happens.
0.0	0.464695219348	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.401899517414	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.251176359547	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.582991956748	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.514920684151	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.738130815153	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.269007693442	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.656533510627	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.0965656256757	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.651413948788	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.0952918596932	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.415338468935	That is not right.
0.0	0.448953457794	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.501773284413	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.294451924698	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.592786262689	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.650025485106	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.286364157199	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.375745501399	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.394147412607	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.262711238656	...John...
0.0	0.314581157401	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.158557812566	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.207762813578	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.316772325225	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.487259624315	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.505335045474	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.429616304766	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.57642457322	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.172430056827	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.290981432137	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.59564627507	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.624392289995	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.382962180192	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.366824377974	We do.
0.0	0.523132417949	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
1.0	0.583399020866	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.30153573395	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.488884033575	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.467400536824	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.413907198814	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.177353907172	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.18853754469	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.610775500111	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.326015491627	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.438475231699	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.433567982345	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.56507002278	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.391510072031	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.407002616908	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.432756558246	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.32194777086	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.106797676446	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.291522218697	Again...
0.0	0.380261659777	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.771196792326	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
1.0	0.482952502519	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.432657205968	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.390997271204	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.434650998151	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.511719565873	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.188869447364	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.502219873377	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.204654568872	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.371380416041	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.465191050809	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.402083330888	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.322725936117	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.526838327526	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.319361537408	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.5380210772	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.770521192012	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.

0.0	0.406108475535	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.

0.0	0.263503228825	...
0.0	0.3457818108	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.

0.0	0.428146520418	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.30395272943	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.500968947224	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.588270484645	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.291513331648	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.44357763073	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.496330193589	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.21839491055	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.196093410282	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.273664830475	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.478860837161	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.176946838185	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.456861888828	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.404248823328	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.565090823349	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.282716290229	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.906402498027	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.379362707741	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.392849901496	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.467426047406	I didn't.
0.0	0.246849172567	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.386627338222	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.380632978847	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.434023276339	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.472615246684	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.591196890421	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.392238057835	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.473327316799	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.322762806361	I love this country.
1.0	0.48901062742	In the past he has called him weak.
1.0	0.397143582956	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.208621966185	It's true.
0.0	0.425484083631	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.520507216892	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.589566380963	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.416320036498	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.269942544603	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.326776407581	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.295877058261	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.105530437347	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.283909138502	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.47383835311	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.461801254461	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.272676306806	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.414941280444	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.521954637652	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.308982740393	OK?
0.0	0.68832134785	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.240625156886	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.46317505027	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.196947985908	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.15254766973	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.303300881142	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.227002367894	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.378049111918	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.600552609199	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.326966577691	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.216624821066	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.45521021864	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.585984818913	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.495606780935	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.262711238656	...Chris...
0.0	0.341838705305	You really can't.
0.0	0.472822283007	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.376316319532	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.378087304725	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.536114140826	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.308843989375	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
1.0	0.670328026956	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.745517419364	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.289007126602	I want security.
0.0	0.506183259028	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.390649427762	You get together.
0.0	0.807581682486	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.359067085779	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.310418161893	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.68990413656	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.248576534198	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.846449283008	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.760361657792	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.269382368161	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.150748378745	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.55631966935	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.595392895833	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.250951314077	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.519785250273	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.309920549626	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.500222784412	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.403132995788	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.409759458277	And you know what?
0.0	0.258366000385	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.544703729949	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.432553855494	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.271147754031	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.411059512547	No vision at all.
0.0	0.561993332372	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.375221520266	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.531786147761	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.308982740393	Yes.
0.0	0.493877457473	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.480393261481	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
1.0	0.603598448083	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.390585234162	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.406092947734	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.459058991975	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.266584368596	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.0680641591279	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.357856265126	We're running.
0.0	0.416524878014	Good at email.
0.0	0.407974678813	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.410296738738	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.549837227126	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
1.0	0.670321653726	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.466268594882	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.438570568693	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.820172862289	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.367240083006	We're friends.
0.0	0.458171414712	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.640086579049	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.814845465669	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.302584969702	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.642100785838	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.330377751363	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.274833835553	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.115239673788	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.348631667486	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.185276836711	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.178041491151	So we need new leadership -- yes.

0.0	0.248424399125	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.463388569353	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.164231244698	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.717802118259	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.330113035453	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.575373914317	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.630430759023	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.

0.0	0.242811539812	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.425287175577	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.

0.0	0.347774362631	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.346846619896	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.315108736809	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.17381056555	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.

0.0	0.474118774941	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.800561962947	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.352450775849	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.162641767702	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.185019324789	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.152628328422	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.38844267431	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.494154516143	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.350174787128	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.564522141586	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.31680430528	We have no borders.
0.0	0.700159497405	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.141329814923	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.309595155614	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.597925733327	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.41639861842	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.411080921591	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.297944190778	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.367489916541	Right.
0.0	0.400767406005	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.244750391271	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.308982740393	Yeah.
0.0	0.203573410604	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.639438289622	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.356073766227	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.250090235544	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.537310777183	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.227279654233	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.420814629727	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.559514633017	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.367489916541	Dynamically.
0.0	0.563962857251	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.398186405232	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.33508598022	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.202836101633	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
1.0	0.900635092321	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.409759458277	And you know what?
0.0	0.483565509614	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.274914996396	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.66441541956	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.379904804488	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.494972220965	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.358534621211	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.322845736414	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.166968894786	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.208486790561	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.252353423919	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
1.0	0.742909623321	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.847215410154	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.388913603917	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
1.0	0.330001355751	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.47381711913	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.191186036719	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.746104652415	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.252165202081	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.501089331998	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.87213152066	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.121347075568	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.434926871328	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.332967072453	Thank you.
1.0	0.74869690646	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.357289648209	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.279067692069	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.26104146957	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
1.0	0.868547269768	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.425340248332	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.528926763394	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.651944612755	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.224123260708	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.515755342573	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.353732712197	I can do that.
0.0	0.31148196508	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.184422495126	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.730884216804	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.15405329869	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.485271291068	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.153291534755	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.492911477068	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.541909280445	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.453354197753	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.322171528762	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.377236861879	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.220317703513	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.664452989763	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.492630556528	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.243214208723	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
1.0	0.827034110938	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.45178021969	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.378543989427	No.
0.0	0.422473813839	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.776974849068	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.328076181478	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.590453982933	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.51924881936	That never works.
0.0	0.278409489077	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.317100296137	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.286969436466	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.436825683662	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.734104467657	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.4777493981	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.163448577589	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.365480941609	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.378428275992	And I would not support those.
1.0	0.390193421184	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.466968832792	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.150367265568	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
1.0	0.547130771234	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.0873372254427	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
1.0	0.957593794206	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.472813237264	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.376888396096	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.564036767007	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.535616236842	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.282192115814	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.475756458182	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.344336435846	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.449397438511	That is important.
0.0	0.372150825989	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.341390695587	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.479527073068	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.645539074954	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.516492924941	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.427947773951	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.471292466909	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.307783693442	I don't care.
0.0	0.52872396784	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.334712741794	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.38763246362	I promise.
0.0	0.401494149592	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.292089888865	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.101559270651	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.523251265971	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.433574841015	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.854400190653	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.322747440809	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.784112559356	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.294817172514	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.126524251838	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.330631352813	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.402686303177	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.620648877987	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.415417500679	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.69482156855	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.442048474685	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.653096149505	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.368462420302	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.660869386671	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.604222321407	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.500663202552	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.374188828785	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.461732826613	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.102672318157	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.324728719344	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.262430456668	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.463839463818	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.305452347005	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.50811898188	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.572941005398	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
1.0	0.54503855043	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.360943736052	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.509688831732	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.308982740393	Yeah.
0.0	0.416254282463	My background is different.
0.0	0.409205142172	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.225806236061	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.643861219138	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.495517054992	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.495572056572	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.629681150076	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.151561760195	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.317874193296	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.0723200979481	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.201410526061	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
1.0	0.458583822883	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.282530042774	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.456245029547	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.198750321144	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.14803162861	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.405975005846	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.293363757734	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.421588662725	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.328254179363	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.180606466341	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.509425002273	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.398838206691	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.560488397814	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.540822733524	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.366824377974	You do.
0.0	0.275100751697	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.197930790663	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.418895112373	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.756863134876	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.371569672741	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.414625305771	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.39736572661	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.149096944371	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.2658884753	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
1.0	0.573297557593	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.416341171258	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.376871227649	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.350121747972	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.339572396076	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.38172783693	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.533119934572	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.379254928918	We have to do something.
0.0	0.495926966616	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.279559557102	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
1.0	0.303791477607	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.3765666694	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.551521848792	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.280787861529	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.400219959609	It never happens.
0.0	0.395454081997	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.431295660635	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.195065733615	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.365753785469	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.234783813826	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.316479091037	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.262709261446	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.418149159256	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.94694628911	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.174564180049	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.609229693575	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.610203278612	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.124017419492	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.257257763846	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.420119684435	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.686126656221	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.263729921518	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.423732960383	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.455683676336	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.220162647	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.291869743029	I like it.
0.0	0.351787570051	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.429543511557	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.278163574386	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.214167734468	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.327942892826	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
1.0	0.612721675551	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.436072012478	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.300177388183	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.694981236904	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.414897658758	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.365538598435	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.158606401332	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.499159244635	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.263503228825	...
0.0	0.484536258402	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.168884555499	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.445587235889	He has never defended...
0.0	0.325873787609	OK, good.
0.0	0.717554135289	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.433532446986	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.379220826584	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.285787487824	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.504235692138	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.37084328759	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.36781819899	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.653840388241	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.456555322583	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.332967072453	Thank you.
0.0	0.362897941007	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.196161857118	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.247506019214	Came out great.
0.0	0.273814643348	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.364076087869	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.528516738674	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.263709273131	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.499056163586	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.631973101028	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.506369638369	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.444072657352	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.310632214941	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
1.0	0.486624570971	Very few children.
0.0	0.351597895233	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.63514710641	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.441863922396	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.576760223552	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.355939388331	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.506609954969	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.168186975214	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.482680325775	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.276310220517	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.316355698843	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.775577659731	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.479519217161	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
1.0	0.596222225294	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.127775591845	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.108624563192	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.538847129848	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.276927282777	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.322206034808	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.531412619945	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.521756306522	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.487364992108	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.9068567844	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.290512861784	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.413129013194	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.39639963057	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.295558277449	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.44302245499	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.47258606042	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.596983364158	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.379716851614	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.449634448049	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.44659063286	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.546588646817	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.400219959609	It goes away.
0.0	0.146486441591	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.45460418679	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.557256393257	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.379253662596	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
1.0	0.721406238057	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.0834221677331	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.783642546207	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.192874635237	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
1.0	0.545226556318	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.318454681335	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
1.0	0.737225281285	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.766258287853	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.782121466877	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.411325054737	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.728757617057	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.661689376276	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.663315258243	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.460037064349	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.717108883682	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.393612748833	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.431307463016	That's not true.
0.0	0.384053823362	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.939588187081	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.583175992001	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.489690813115	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.587406608099	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.357137179585	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.54553707455	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
1.0	0.76224578568	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.332967072453	Thank you.
0.0	0.411686544407	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.354920098176	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.413237786214	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.159911221324	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.396937364562	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.605349733666	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.403881217433	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.324957654429	Big difference.
0.0	0.403699520882	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.320887953871	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.467325179552	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.555257217271	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.409759458277	And you know what?
0.0	0.316683867095	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.474989013087	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.556229708924	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.294681809388	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.49866798772	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.313042395817	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.408725326057	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.681597359742	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.386572047505	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.31179294678	I don't like that.
0.0	0.367489916541	Absolutely.
0.0	0.238163929822	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.374882034262	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.604493780965	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.294155289755	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.212361365499	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.482918572521	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.576683537697	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.292463143717	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.656609563348	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.269681380159	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.226943842218	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.432547245782	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.214464300658	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.209744514238	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.349423836486	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.277349740965	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.402375904219	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.559324147963	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.151612897951	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.646237633931	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.209295696306	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.556405429879	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.226802718652	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.363874851876	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.433876967428	It's their money.
0.0	0.423380781207	We are not France.
0.0	0.37463969344	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.65341101704	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.329871453768	We need sound money.
0.0	0.43168160077	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.440654175082	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.

0.0	0.441782052803	You did.
0.0	0.10152779384	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.217824198003	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.

0.0	0.0921706341365	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.393397503301	And not just green cards.

0.0	0.311530038186	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.434410933823	Well, I did.
0.0	0.300097122808	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.421196328914	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.263280528875	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.296211927261	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.506503713154	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.417732828092	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.

0.0	0.637304616687	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.660369566241	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.310294498492	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.

0.0	0.221202584109	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.430339573572	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.450218701273	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.

0.0	0.627045345034	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.455532047408	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.824928129144	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.503483591984	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.328453850232	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.417268100225	I've done it.
0.0	0.20005034897	And I think together we will make progress.

0.0	0.475756458182	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.733153362547	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.518196449599	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.29594928749	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.253642694603	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.

0.0	0.31127206405	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.

0.0	0.33678013863	I will not do that.
0.0	0.182578883813	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.365996571102	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.263503228825	...

0.0	0.384209562682	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?

0.0	0.517112748502	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.317312111525	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.127557146949	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.422199177003	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.270524539848	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.678872827428	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.36001837469	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.669694036791	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.326159819922	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.162315289688	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.609982655889	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.289802765367	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.332967072453	Thank you.
0.0	0.351259938276	I can't do it.
0.0	0.297659342627	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.368083299643	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.360850070617	About Medicare?
0.0	0.360170822494	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.332967072453	Thank you.
0.0	0.361251633825	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.408525747089	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.280159245616	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.212119227338	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.49625816263	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.386717424081	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.319642126942	You're welcome.
0.0	0.293083740205	...Thank you.
0.0	0.531287302209	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.436087681803	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.582229234826	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.313213520969	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.420000439473	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.452358295372	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.344440146543	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.40595375091	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.383494511468	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.222714807028	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.519158676355	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.292122811663	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
1.0	0.552512299901	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.264388816318	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.507278157057	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.351761968433	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.350726075572	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.222320182822	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.343221675414	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.681200822997	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.440349879361	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.678677732213	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.455043418067	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.110571448014	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.463558525159	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.683885323574	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.67903444812	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.344792291213	I would change them.
0.0	0.710234576862	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.271269162366	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.557543268193	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.12924785854	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
1.0	0.3419385045	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.489495602739	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.0649390447174	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.352890565727	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.448313184456	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.521933935132	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.149978012172	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.324157893423	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.383089011144	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.494771485254	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.894446107638	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.251421494517	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.32134232706	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.363003464241	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.376340751979	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.377590324204	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.239238464632	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
1.0	0.75156972902	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.46123680751	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.125856108315	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.43304684282	We actually did it.
0.0	0.542455783954	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
1.0	0.159602777291	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.148501033956	...No, sir...
0.0	0.259868348392	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.622302920642	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
1.0	0.519543212389	They were wrong.
0.0	0.438481001545	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.318706905653	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.497587547415	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.221547097549	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.679095021128	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.315312253369	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
1.0	0.700114313421	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.424793819745	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.254410874996	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.328279958194	The answer is no.
0.0	0.245367475042	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.593892210027	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.522537854359	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.154694948565	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.428087825572	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.23699179485	It needs to be repealed and replaced.

0.0	0.339072564178	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.27163597751	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.

0.0	0.365788848983	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.416255481889	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.

0.0	0.531254943705	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.164984754868	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.

0.0	0.52517683814	Well, the deal was done.

0.0	0.366318001659	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.35479271138	We need security.
0.0	0.238509375074	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.467472337363	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.406232899661	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.338874383911	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.217576212432	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.208198257106	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.216722768427	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.71465118237	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.543991635783	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.835047248907	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.260818603031	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.425670608412	I never said that.
0.0	0.429774430417	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.337513560184	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.54771816338	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.265813974247	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.437466207966	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.

0.0	0.433431164915	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.203116351793	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.623139689127	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.390649427762	You're right.
0.0	0.662716961336	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.636781155163	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.228239921121	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.

0.0	0.52123537657	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.325694193692	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.3325379933	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.614191459326	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.467054976241	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.480799097886	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.45673818418	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.403104333402	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.362007220094	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.77438611676	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.760798503823	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.

0.0	0.535075108322	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.466893761654	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.474268338601	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.731860008941	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.708805251019	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.253557518569	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.36803149251	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.390480994961	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.488971407648	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.34832829712	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.489616713751	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.367795246668	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.409759458277	And you know what?
0.0	0.317370359361	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.491745913245	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.363688151205	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.0682501811811	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.515796041035	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.174203733587	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.40155266659	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.387355638622	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.345339113161	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.264875339986	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.406306360381	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.313372206181	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.204413004867	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.450984430756	I changed that.
0.0	0.350372047581	And we are not England.
0.0	0.445734612385	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.347969166212	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.627826781571	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.37621722998	It is.
0.0	0.0608665765826	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.378409059978	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.309890114293	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.364407937387	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.21074012366	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.409759458277	And you know what?
0.0	0.362062834329	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.388064673022	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.472730444746	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.393186169291	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.421037831257	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.222227042639	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.476412676072	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.660242965215	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.353750634736	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.228139597114	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.718094057987	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.407013342562	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.775228871623	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.559102876271	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.259570326269	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.474192282118	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.659965911601	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.469664579075	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.199705736744	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.43768248253	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.53831050725	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.367489916541	Absolutely.
0.0	0.337880661245	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.139764233896	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
1.0	0.501880093795	They stole it.
0.0	0.366996944414	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.47523955894	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.861021673215	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.649718081755	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.359009411261	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.352357677829	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.383799122625	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.318313549409	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.461830251104	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.332967072453	Thank you.
0.0	0.308982740393	OK?
0.0	0.183724505927	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.247496237763	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.213835784543	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.331049451812	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.278784891241	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.637419806694	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.764083566484	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.380834478099	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.451249076199	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.138293026424	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.749869032046	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.488217401215	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.323341767418	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.205763916853	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.278635715599	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.345969451792	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.394545924327	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.42446038202	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.839410218446	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.469566953729	That's what I said.
0.0	0.357145189492	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.168899449635	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.560757796624	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.264404173358	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.165253164116	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.444321871183	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.652860485625	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.51915223099	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.519697069731	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.332967072453	Thank you.
0.0	0.393640864258	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.194015936703	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.267054889676	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.434226573989	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.760963132903	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.262839581052	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.545083401214	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.537325485365	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.291576258751	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.413458454635	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.502619215904	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.309256649874	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.531774168154	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.490310844454	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.365452622463	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.0303173369025	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.24644754142	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.269803829416	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.518644599733	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.335899722019	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.407036225506	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.438241439465	That's right.
0.0	0.308741329583	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.631543395944	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.189154583108	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
1.0	0.94325177655	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.191865828623	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.359438006501	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.311775856797	Check it out.
0.0	0.431009960514	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.338787178199	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.0690714004503	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.394363064568	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.41211031667	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.610118961778	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.512267711664	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.286420817801	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.365917184622	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.828564781526	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.245257146473	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.270661777147	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.260543744458	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.409422713789	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.616987597095	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.430054487646	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.368462420302	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.526536231458	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.423035621385	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.203752509108	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.587596689666	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.435753073724	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.253035709167	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.518467210687	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.270260797216	You looking at me?
0.0	0.459973836096	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.658206204882	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
1.0	0.343956520819	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.633196612775	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
1.0	0.467429026894	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.233547390006	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.616248552252	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.576095377118	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.55155052591	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.291002380636	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.200376383698	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.252153200786	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.314721190067	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.443248107597	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.434243000678	You know why three?
0.0	0.519528157381	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.424534424708	I will show you what they do to women.
1.0	0.56164673187	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
1.0	0.832632275786	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.564999442157	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.178982461089	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.253707403028	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
1.0	0.581085305671	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.509016693088	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.267545137047	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.102557005456	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.405212660733	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.0570032424806	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
1.0	0.328101145281	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.390261577456	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.21358804214	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.449514622137	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.364629213404	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.493463051296	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.471446133966	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.507716871259	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.467604537046	I know every one.
0.0	0.140122767981	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.528617084748	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.268491975522	What should we do?
0.0	0.456979682023	And the last piece is this.
1.0	0.200578842995	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.510225030388	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.59659159885	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.599799861362	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.279231223846	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.434298405439	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.232107455073	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.310574762155	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.600100987754	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.86492692926	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.308982740393	Yes.
0.0	0.25464372791	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.271304846472	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.557965508947	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.410394465614	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.522685844449	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.452828630484	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.331760702418	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.638687956296	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.412926099984	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.409523836946	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.579643401143	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.428452235204	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.303036620435	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.366581360365	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.172093302294	And here's why.
0.0	0.60573211718	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.552274807483	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.316771319246	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.478330365629	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.242406411535	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.38948066984	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.49039015394	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.25419576161	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.432689157137	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.549757956282	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.264773664669	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.93089685772	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.685591428035	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.514491076697	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.588354285299	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.548774202004	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.284766413333	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.256699904169	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.456097531625	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.47334725357	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.342177870423	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.373100864993	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.454570245478	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.358109481326	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.310011306051	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.634263512225	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.602002369407	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.277394706078	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.349123502825	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.498251971335	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.501724945009	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.494183835365	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.234173710084	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.323452836637	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.0993274716168	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.294286439058	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.448859788274	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
1.0	0.464378850481	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.487549607104	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.354561981272	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.188998875636	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.378543989427	No.
0.0	0.212143487239	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.0943799594089	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.458481274924	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.374630739533	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.315572131971	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.389642110029	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.429523020888	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.317274476525	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.150498813303	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.220982069286	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.451564557411	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.0741029535907	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.240574846932	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.423968826075	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.45495366721	He's wrong.
0.0	0.389462512122	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.464490663888	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.37914476901	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.47775363234	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.361859093682	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.36441177927	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.142809155169	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.36141180827	This will end.
0.0	0.221327634433	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.221858821046	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.264011829107	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.368436752101	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.0892945107064	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.729925350315	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.338362203329	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.245641289615	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.472877250085	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.727253598322	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.59192408225	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.53097804866	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.423724555438	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.237748274557	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.261631105978	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.135755628645	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.555434935239	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.343580573093	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.23363981037	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.598738682905	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.407135362562	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.487407994606	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.216213292647	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.558133593667	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.187222687369	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.441737679205	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.300481169649	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.263123927594	You just want to...
0.0	0.390649427762	You're right.
0.0	0.255651526701	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.320749842308	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.516920646541	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.168601035041	Good luck making something out of this mess."
1.0	0.736255327247	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.140270339964	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.349381514649	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.313431445843	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.322106936407	They know.
0.0	0.530649490342	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.453051037977	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.146060291854	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.236985321031	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.372007498927	And, we said no.
1.0	0.624823909658	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.144121683082	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.48009123261	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.286307693282	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.406108802443	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.234610471293	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.

0.0	0.515537938833	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.242899104579	That's my view.
0.0	0.654740807979	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.

0.0	0.418212828947	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.46895006324	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.460143367665	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.161087999977	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.537249122112	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.465574736845	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.245038140934	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.372053008027	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.439718041689	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.30816721388	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.234619563772	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.

0.0	0.37370507242	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.107096532108	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.175291319636	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.446565616776	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.293836415117	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.475979208541	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.381594777074	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.387343480056	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.429443928798	We're going to cut costs.

0.0	0.475867095179	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.310426924226	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.468607979958	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.139066290997	But also, I can't fake anger.
1.0	0.585331264798	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.437675265239	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.114660794594	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.510281175873	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.130580509013	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.165530997464	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.435469190209	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.448612349804	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.387667148078	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.410738803925	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.351729481716	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.164903459517	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.268984175757	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.607827547046	She voted for it.
0.0	0.165962357265	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.383856349347	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.709603784947	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.234820141808	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.487991181545	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.191865828623	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.400474240682	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.246133635394	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.293591315618	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.268232542489	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.390137475212	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.412073705606	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.434124452298	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.449529404486	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.841803351349	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.424075221031	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.498221300212	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.42314770803	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.407402214786	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.655749389479	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.

0.0	0.283766268184	It's not working.
0.0	0.766139332672	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.386262836382	He's wrong.
0.0	0.554504768996	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.613394335917	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.428434692807	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.18819535555	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.497554085056	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.397233592444	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.695227549389	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.309939610181	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.354565508945	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.34967639185	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.294964300932	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.309920549626	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.309596469448	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.243589791228	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.150968721384	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.494622609989	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.367397112915	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.382448533153	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.266633171988	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.451178171607	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.352840224615	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.

0.0	0.544644652101	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.356338155786	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.157409762418	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.315110512272	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.54806502913	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.380449083798	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.511730992807	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.232129560293	I would just say that...
0.0	0.434361788597	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.389141287352	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.390568538332	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.289548470661	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.

0.0	0.39539377473	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.19489070901	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.537936999616	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.375025299663	He does great.

0.0	0.484077855219	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.47937077839	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.767947803722	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.559488066812	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.450058191298	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.460993685989	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
1.0	0.443796408221	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.419949398157	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.506850269342	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.426969039634	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.496406667049	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.

0.0	0.384705827992	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.334458656925	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.789105988722	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.439928071685	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.353991812866	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.50193496939	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.508886155305	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.49963352341	I said no.
0.0	0.22310658137	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.537210405076	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.366824377974	I do.
0.0	0.230938768848	It feels different.
0.0	0.540154374952	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.350082286123	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.479655707085	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.61662199967	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.809575166192	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.229874916332	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.167650364574	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.430628021433	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.425046171149	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.367400729367	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.449837301092	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.721902793024	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.383272416302	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.33751654143	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.269321678715	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.156489025723	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.367489916541	Right.
0.0	0.303433464676	And for good cause.
0.0	0.477090316601	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.21673856826	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
1.0	0.83113088237	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.72678144525	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.339382246485	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.513369035982	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.32768827001	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.218093537829	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.442086436435	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.404457753252	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.498207889364	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.169418977222	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.44364749231	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.321496806777	So you might not.
0.0	0.305267287528	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.143323619224	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.308982740393	Okay.
0.0	0.159241001011	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.575749994361	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.766139332672	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.670341023385	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.213242754649	But...
0.0	0.524100995729	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.612233156228	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.400412093684	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.289115477155	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.283714172091	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.36841490684	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.454843154806	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.347087958225	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.450072438262	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.370026828529	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.776172362573	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.164669566521	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.427663319512	You have to lead.
0.0	0.506609954969	It's driving up stock prices.
1.0	0.709497125821	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.464179055326	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.434766533159	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.55191374251	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.505987884377	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.64768791435	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.491811579742	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.486315218399	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.381202639803	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.511741028065	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.489195747226	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.331049828402	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.314590701138	You count on it.
0.0	0.420739380982	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.77816881797	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.667574256349	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.617991820455	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.251613817466	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.607372579108	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.19336254358	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.325900532581	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.343561545452	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.315182535741	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.57437115321	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.301563225119	The time to turn the page is now.
1.0	0.690136789846	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.293380402438	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.274390792264	Are you serious about this election?
1.0	0.820303138519	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.409779377137	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.315308665291	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.371403530492	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.384053573074	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.663991615189	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.321007280948	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.348918091253	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.439599051491	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.450607745892	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.499114952359	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.281263787965	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.511299198047	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.38317881577	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.365788450093	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.207414194811	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.305306962365	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
1.0	0.827700911031	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.479711639568	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.444846465732	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.582913118158	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.411250025367	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.793010619132	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.282175477149	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.364895184336	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.454581728044	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.150084112695	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.226621524105	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.470353594402	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.569029109611	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.36300918786	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.377478494047	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.134056637913	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.

0.0	0.460737232412	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.428002139704	Judy, one area very briefly...

0.0	0.484172456847	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.

0.0	0.319582720269	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.0676694566882	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.

0.0	0.318543719878	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.497129659092	The Democrats can't even come up with one.

0.0	0.412943451192	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.278449268352	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.368504987302	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.279083050256	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.310534934841	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
1.0	0.548911707576	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.258690491634	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.399816388849	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.39443518561	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.345969451792	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.355028535758	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.450665839591	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.816602576976	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.335569233481	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.0926700069291	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.259844524327	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.757527900595	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.215856422383	I think you're --
0.0	0.48655098405	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.558020578393	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.123824855143	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.33553365541	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.511240602092	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.881777887571	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.359801973849	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.408151805639	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.349707586555	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.191789503272	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.234019291499	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.0751304394102	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.335712523008	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.738180504872	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.55508218836	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.538255117488	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.332967072453	Thank you.
0.0	0.0706191381	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.234407996583	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.450525196174	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.186060902698	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.27339409709	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.252938085598	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.408416188883	You've got to give people hope.
1.0	0.797163511471	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.509278522999	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.379826771657	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.621931401343	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.443368232715	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.266736271678	How great is that?
0.0	0.23133680136	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.367488287607	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.459890737358	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.261813967539	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.576121919632	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.27486696985	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.332481521662	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.322000706728	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.491386536629	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
1.0	0.362745169779	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.19282934912	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.345459096979	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.173420648233	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.311476136016	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.193695505699	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
1.0	0.556262388716	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.542586817793	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.248855639505	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.361908190371	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.145182336139	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.321112842684	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.202638099314	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.288768292616	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.375389584718	Alright.
0.0	0.449988562993	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.403099909274	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.545217816281	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.379389337198	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.425540333082	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.613810918155	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.402018495661	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.145447742343	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.375389584718	John.
0.0	0.467080352908	But judgment matters as well.
1.0	0.467903358328	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.215800955382	And why?
0.0	0.127480284607	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.336747388279	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.284432808053	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.338520439019	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.452272599532	We were wrong.
0.0	0.463722284424	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.367489916541	Right.
0.0	0.369857336429	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.293844641206	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.2434821686	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.258171135686	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.486275774366	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.630056495572	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.388980531664	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.361930202315	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.492154622816	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.381335335964	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.153009565007	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.609174424212	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.286794063472	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.298587815898	Neil...
0.0	0.468830171325	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.625608401828	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.269956296325	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.332967072453	Thank you.
0.0	0.562448758119	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.130054446145	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.174198535668	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.338588752083	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.403094618516	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.370617896678	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.552645991777	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.877173041996	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.394797255208	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.461718322384	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.382781822859	That's what he is.
0.0	0.338517792918	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.396224224546	This is 2016.
0.0	0.49016748069	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.432122846863	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.355801480707	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.507782238757	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.282246066934	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.196402621158	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.487759741802	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.524695907802	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.332967072453	Thank you.
0.0	0.38303903202	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.353273046184	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.396687077761	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.364211183389	We don't win.
0.0	0.189629314174	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.519500542961	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.129549979106	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.451465712951	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.622496567342	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.35376855902	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.225294810008	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.532579396811	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.160774776002	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.239274425252	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.400234456144	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.356792237345	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.650776489606	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.410364542993	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.200473319866	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.367130427123	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.410030194755	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.489313011358	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.262385808259	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.325624682356	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.425670608412	I never said that.
0.0	0.36206439238	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.444207047638	So you know what?
0.0	0.52934191622	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.570929455954	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.374493053901	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.364002195029	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.185824944425	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.314214311233	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.323880719559	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.606196031415	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.280731132579	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.278294806932	I mean, you know...
1.0	0.59888380288	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.397812289478	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.158009278322	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.374834272687	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.663229191852	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.533952100384	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.951212752146	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.278844256799	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.5149293223	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.156193156637	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.229135897856	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.455516455031	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.430656496847	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.842014763439	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.429164276898	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.791352480317	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.368965711808	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.722070581976	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.399831412704	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.408831531145	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.378839844736	In addition to that...
0.0	0.415250583511	to save a company.
0.0	0.332967072453	Thank you.
0.0	0.409759458277	But you know what?
0.0	0.305830175359	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.509892743236	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.295175681409	You know why?
0.0	0.178244713682	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.364862769716	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.183475486682	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.409759458277	And you know what?
0.0	0.455789042062	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.938755874687	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.457094106817	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.310358128782	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.368038535032	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.357502884728	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.460812860482	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.192228290208	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.332881503557	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.22123787	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.634016270448	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.392691106088	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.448808017639	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.650590579947	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.460495680495	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.478611745865	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.237609048646	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.561035426885	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.549253332133	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.255668602997	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.417045300416	A brief response.
0.0	0.433791312558	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.288522077717	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.231709859013	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.755013371954	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.544232041838	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.368459285326	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.308982740393	OK.
0.0	0.50150646764	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.19485032828	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.145070874144	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.560095925342	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.39459607022	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.282390679062	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.528240316413	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.302245562174	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.524213370251	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.347622591467	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.400411175178	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.308889088134	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.406255541624	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.276141495075	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.230149412435	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.47449486744	But we stuck to our message.
1.0	0.500473367081	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.432284094727	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.314136140403	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.375093645325	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.322893489142	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.191897620599	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.393281647107	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.519151299529	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.508769019328	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.405529572359	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.467350186664	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.655381851707	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.159011890879	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.468021250531	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.32422897591	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.433567982345	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.438027618112	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.237242749051	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.146205857233	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.75671622938	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.422928876344	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.363019578411	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.322144006868	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.360840541484	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.278493717477	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.50336337654	That's fine.
0.0	0.359769664719	(inaudible).
0.0	0.390240627208	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.451250175929	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.807404770723	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.410523733627	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.268517504373	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.493712699383	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.378767795232	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.483432430285	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.53155016289	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.443827291837	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.539409251504	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.40899208607	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.524636375667	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.526302709114	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.326307569317	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.386172573462	Creativity.
0.0	0.570229741346	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.283421646636	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.347986206938	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.263503228825	...
0.0	0.184502125944	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.457037807414	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.301461603329	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.530706942078	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.477779772026	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.107592340655	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.41547901769	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.363338971621	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.373291732938	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.332322034228	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.236926928	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.331467382283	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.426140293107	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.222355811691	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.302949383035	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.401617022084	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.294897835707	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.74276533165	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.864090025463	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.570276347087	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.572218879739	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.201024512668	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.362913328186	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.367657047277	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.442326533168	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.138865571598	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.470674245364	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.453175966839	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.360410232916	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.488514171834	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.280411504253	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.481538516732	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
1.0	0.468387897532	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.308982740393	Yes.
0.0	0.254980550577	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.482731157751	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.363186790585	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.573876925287	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.328605914817	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.580086617986	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.373387666065	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.383016779052	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.405526831007	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.350041229281	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.190549748495	And we're talking about fantasy football?
1.0	0.405298166314	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.158222876686	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.378464712273	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.355709837342	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.636091635852	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.143376551583	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.210029741013	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.311124111577	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.323052611954	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.658058216846	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.291849964855	Well, sure.
0.0	0.72605675838	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.230183183253	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.365807549106	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.155810319678	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.376271644605	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.391382221347	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.346984052137	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.601358460108	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.440539485202	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.257939959059	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.31069699052	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.110258278928	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.646939767459	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.458475293371	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.134846072662	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.504000624356	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.438465240932	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.551743085606	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.328987545831	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.583408492513	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.0488204016586	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.361289993594	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.258034735108	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.196847235426	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.470717652549	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.442768210141	We both have a lot of small donors.
1.0	0.485677842667	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.315582210189	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.934965500353	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.5366559752	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.699394124618	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.37759312017	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.379863979835	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.538192307414	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.517145621762	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.454514940291	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.441782052803	It was.
0.0	0.615072906205	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.366872091419	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.214184320919	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.606485934831	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.72994970719	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.351699902859	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.662579746728	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.480066548964	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.385038679232	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.325972346517	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.180956599516	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.427214630072	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.241115893828	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.0828855604838	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.419573264723	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.0847625846141	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.434792245326	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.613798263548	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.520239732896	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.311104692041	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.332854543703	Divide that out.
0.0	0.265463257095	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.263387760594	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.366730149795	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.440807440648	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.256222183161	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.335714158341	That's for sure.
0.0	0.282359423904	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.610449517	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.122287238927	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.342176613036	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.463301720584	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.384433072922	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.788876678145	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.366882233229	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.425254713051	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.307756882932	And we need to do that throughout the country.
1.0	0.856440780849	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.322862083459	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.650609991857	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.486044782964	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.484859900964	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.414313971657	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.481821717745	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.370855764659	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.430325177632	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.523844405891	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.401756055716	I got that.
0.0	0.237979802303	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.344542742549	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.421214462055	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.382762584677	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.446866940682	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.235747082714	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.126892714139	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.255791573191	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.218891438434	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.486026791547	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.271697712891	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.347265072564	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.551516836072	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.491234972992	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.572543807555	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.324023825785	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.637538789292	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.199975570368	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.260128938025	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.713963969698	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.362479190319	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.293928106227	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.683581733901	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.289526595248	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.321953013705	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.154866569127	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.468598392596	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.265258965875	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.319928816484	That is...
0.0	0.673651814152	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.242394156083	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.384891179586	slot.
0.0	0.598250271141	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.49304075273	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.374403746565	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.545252437226	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.355050433651	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.647554313317	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.5540249414	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.318081103898	Think about it.
0.0	0.212588798084	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.309930033862	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.130380340707	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.240668418644	The number of women --
0.0	0.764407175699	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.442507972398	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.716128891551	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.434243000678	You know why three?
0.0	0.902352349068	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.29222659222	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.332967072453	Thank you.
0.0	0.709249631414	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.286368354821	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.521940074192	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.485182773825	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.355972510967	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.162267177956	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
1.0	0.434518112828	That's wrong.
0.0	0.261539097492	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.263750693116	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.25420765662	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.376805471441	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.240214657006	...eliminates the business...
1.0	0.737918514255	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.343939556133	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.12898328778	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.231643762587	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.659291513734	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.240470179645	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.

0.0	0.203401644743	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.

0.0	0.181448078617	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.467187048232	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.185118915233	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.597049890765	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.436848237819	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.337925790628	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.455081586782	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.

0.0	0.177595666341	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.662779253402	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.

1.0	0.638178302526	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.472269161393	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.159456782459	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.22028061866	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.270718163827	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.482981507442	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.424484700568	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.618989992746	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.510901801161	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.547881161049	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.441971648892	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.359898290522	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.170414068664	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.65566730776	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.563049295308	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.50991675099	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?

0.0	0.40212819409	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.185474572022	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.415830424624	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.445070461481	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.537715580792	But we allowed people to keep health care.

0.0	0.349358608446	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.387471299477	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."

0.0	0.524075427368	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.264734136889	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.424075221031	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.414073211665	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
