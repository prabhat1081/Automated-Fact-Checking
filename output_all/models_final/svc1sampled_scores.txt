1.0	0.664960516674	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
1.0	0.625764023575	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
1.0	0.765725707705	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
1.0	0.489016269336	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
1.0	0.924309134839	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
1.0	0.47112341292	HEMMER: Wow.
1.0	0.5	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
1.0	0.725551216926	We can't do it.
1.0	0.940448844956	They can't even make a deal.
1.0	0.53109374745	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
1.0	0.979664657243	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
1.0	0.582525611767	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
1.0	0.779580388277	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
1.0	0.535091783888	Listen, I want to just comment.
1.0	0.937755916784	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
1.0	0.599197400067	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
1.0	0.405062289641	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
1.0	0.203263253539	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
1.0	0.390218524683	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
1.0	0.327576081171	And I'm glad I did it.
1.0	0.386168595935	And, I'll do that with the country.
1.0	0.770421815846	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
1.0	0.530404627037	They're off to China.
1.0	0.650480945096	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
1.0	0.816015998241	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
1.0	0.48963210761	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
1.0	0.645913831973	This is not some small scale group.
1.0	0.30060321528	How do I know this?
1.0	0.545600208002	That's a blessing.
1.0	0.712516810243	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
1.0	0.539773598409	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
1.0	0.403357147284	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
1.0	0.296720396194	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
1.0	0.682418013217	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
1.0	0.348083807629	I changed it in New Jersey.
1.0	0.392692703459	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
1.0	0.530491095011	But we allowed people to keep health care.
1.0	0.875653805857	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
1.0	0.533573131134	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
1.0	0.460252023325	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
1.0	0.957804586161	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
1.0	0.618849055896	It goes away.
1.0	0.720699442087	They go to Yale.
1.0	0.678655176929	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
1.0	0.470773743483	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
1.0	0.445310862775	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
1.0	0.591041330369	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
1.0	0.608681038836	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
1.0	0.380996176551	No.
1.0	0.361749122076	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
1.0	0.448816662318	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
1.0	0.788097548469	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
1.0	0.582474811527	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
1.0	0.537178392315	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
1.0	0.789041418879	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
1.0	0.850818271657	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
1.0	0.688863727194	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
1.0	0.558797150997	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
1.0	0.679240956473	But also, I can't fake anger.
1.0	0.511929372102	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
1.0	0.872318251661	You're simply not.
1.0	0.328373685976	The student loan problem has been created by government.
1.0	0.508260986266	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
1.0	0.633920572088	And that's what we have to contrast.
1.0	0.880079846815	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
1.0	0.250792673612	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
1.0	0.598303875273	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
1.0	0.590314862857	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
1.0	0.719663961943	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
1.0	0.85803360887	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
1.0	0.262222829799	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
1.0	0.883983855956	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
1.0	0.531365506778	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
1.0	0.765809322982	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
1.0	0.623946421318	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
1.0	0.605399900465	It is.
1.0	0.535670949743	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
1.0	0.5	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
1.0	0.574775682061	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
1.0	0.5	I am against the raids.
1.0	0.766626520957	And that is wrong.
1.0	0.773277201234	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
1.0	0.49116929276	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
1.0	0.682216624294	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
1.0	0.426523565966	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
1.0	0.827917104751	It will be a long day.
1.0	0.852685059579	We lose on trade.
1.0	0.5886507159	So there are people watching tonight in business.
1.0	0.474576926538	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
1.0	0.751613600108	We have not provided them.
1.0	0.886973340103	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
1.0	0.971351266457	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
1.0	0.658531405396	And you know what?
1.0	0.508178060878	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
1.0	0.720988440172	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
1.0	0.143571701171	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
1.0	0.652232646172	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
1.0	0.832763527069	You don't want to hear the answer.
1.0	0.520060225075	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
1.0	0.613014768251	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
1.0	0.833278152929	-- the governor's absolutely right.
1.0	0.580503962598	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
1.0	0.881729939651	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
1.0	0.380883117385	Play by the rules.
1.0	0.400357704473	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
1.0	0.722498203759	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
1.0	0.0571703236068	I never said that.
1.0	0.485341591749	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
1.0	0.786901336136	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
1.0	0.29726149685	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
1.0	0.66056418001	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
1.0	0.406480060575	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
1.0	0.53233405774	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
1.0	0.593846404756	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
1.0	0.5	You really can't.
1.0	0.316216620539	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
1.0	0.812308674566	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
1.0	0.43585249805	I'd sign that executive order.
1.0	0.588769249688	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
1.0	0.559299524193	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
1.0	0.978989216776	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
1.0	0.825879531185	Just for the record.
1.0	0.839643795471	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
1.0	0.47385164704	This is a business flat tax.
1.0	0.778433620573	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
1.0	0.602394410931	Thank you all very much.
1.0	0.843368561817	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
1.0	0.439787773454	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
1.0	0.828198288576	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
1.0	0.38030891904	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
1.0	0.5	We will arm and train the Kurds.
1.0	0.241458894484	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.561336787678	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.216274625059	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.972057323479	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.344372325062	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.469862331505	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.512699021465	They stole it.
0.0	0.39654632019	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.230967513273	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.212089110368	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.33019614334	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.366327496571	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.447602666671	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.288600788029	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.404610073515	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.231551256005	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.864900107265	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.391459205092	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.509007371287	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.560082507375	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.967659812391	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.177522874418	About Medicare?
0.0	0.990559259441	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.612736800697	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.117633401848	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.746480933326	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.287739428173	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.355869311389	My background is different.
0.0	0.683822904716	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.590678401519	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.177850432646	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.645612033923	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.791097500951	Thank you.
0.0	0.412236386633	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.127793206715	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.238763609536	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.120591686622	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.562068439131	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.2302325162	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.341022022015	...
0.0	0.468835562106	OK?
0.0	0.198330649638	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.583169043876	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.267686319822	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.54676922266	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.122101412028	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.450518761775	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.269995742258	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.335176501206	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.130604916045	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.877740431207	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.422283376619	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.403009129014	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.484005967968	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.00981664986137	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.265151732179	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.465066608919	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.456735008246	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.525359896432	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.170552170091	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.525893660197	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.528274120455	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
