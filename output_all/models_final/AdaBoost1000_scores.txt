0.0	0.499401614449	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.500014146546	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.493140388398	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.497335000914	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.499244579764	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.489217459127	But...
0.0	0.498862016327	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.501797582166	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.492014320252	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.496545672964	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.498006842299	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.500516843918	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.499574593585	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.498411145099	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.499944914748	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.488742678136	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.491292231993	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.49866432093	I have...
0.0	0.496708840467	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.498179814091	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.499135373576	I promise.
0.0	0.498986596216	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.497030677413	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.501213456206	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.500059164294	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.508696329451	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.501827507407	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
1.0	0.500413376968	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.499280625938	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.492934584004	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.499164786301	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.498707276138	I understand.
0.0	0.498904142081	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.498184861989	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.498477248302	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.498913842927	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.499393324222	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.500840527181	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.500956880586	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.497396719722	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.499081904311	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.491891529658	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.498686706637	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.48990044207	So...
0.0	0.499544719438	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
1.0	0.504048934638	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.498429643063	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.502849867353	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.499456757779	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.498677658986	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.498993068996	I'll say this.
0.0	0.492610976603	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.499167581063	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.497778767165	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.503971495765	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.491521603843	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.49955999948	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.500407560527	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.499296823341	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.492963175436	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.498707343563	It is.
0.0	0.500906950906	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.496846754276	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.500221220114	He hit oil.
0.0	0.501359020862	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.501511695671	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.506542398359	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.506081588568	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.500706207228	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.500249667029	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.49687988525	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.499076355329	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.499479677484	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.500552228544	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.49964228399	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.479814939096	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.501405130071	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.49823472774	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.497845279176	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.489661552446	OK?
0.0	0.490504789903	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.497757100891	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.498802829989	No -- no...
0.0	0.501009273535	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.50091163756	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.500603115574	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.499897376623	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.508320502497	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.495728374643	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.499552649455	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.499250336504	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.499459661134	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.499614818497	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.498250808783	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.4996085346	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.49850315956	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.500968367368	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.499395572207	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.50261855824	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.500616881491	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.489025432496	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.499634902144	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.500257613821	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.498751433333	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.499788276755	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.501709625596	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.500115513776	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.499404887303	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.509957956567	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.498994007966	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.499402104783	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.500082807145	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.501508060929	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.501783888062	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.499991171665	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.499313524303	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.489852352068	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.50279688869	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.504273298142	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.49003152247	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.512057226783	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.499452108111	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.499573683797	Think about it.
0.0	0.489509925999	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.504092264839	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.503717937469	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.499651812891	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.500964427455	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.50168299092	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
1.0	0.493407453148	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.489661552446	Yeah.
0.0	0.49942730976	But I would add this.
1.0	0.501490951005	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
1.0	0.510766394423	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.499404865297	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.496960470536	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.499383930835	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.515551871203	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.499176802532	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.499385908618	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
1.0	0.499852162274	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.498754211549	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.501089827891	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.489875025436	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
1.0	0.511009418905	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.503975665108	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.49962143193	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.4994639172	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.492466683751	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.499580290645	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.50120291718	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.484954454184	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.498923252084	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.499758740477	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.500569616646	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.498616524788	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.500606492066	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.506396093526	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.500271617545	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.494655671329	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.491040793402	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.499340187254	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.501179295258	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.486379736998	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.494989333678	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.499533815987	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.501691838667	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.500474739679	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.513012992204	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.500120478101	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.493468160043	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.499673839941	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.49887277515	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.502512510276	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.499754364871	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.501473059382	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.498567385088	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.498525037521	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.489632159322	...
0.0	0.499722512854	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.499310988886	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.499453863732	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.499479972097	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.502588232619	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.49974776809	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.498928690936	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.49953397046	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.497642226764	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.498750844691	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.500203784424	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.49978119802	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.497771116755	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.499447419569	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.497679691435	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.502897693285	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.497417497216	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.496818549516	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.499093192043	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.500206026618	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.499999830781	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.500296782496	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.499885038662	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.503308309482	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.49046090958	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.499644987542	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.500618951927	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.500550019767	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.506409903254	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.503068950998	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.499023550441	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.501429269946	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.495575187274	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.50306711305	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.496741446058	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.489216643898	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.498849058799	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.497221983543	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.500597064345	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.499958086722	Maria, let me clear something up here.
1.0	0.509485446318	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.499362798257	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.499940025904	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.489217459127	And...
0.0	0.499957215887	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.499480612901	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.501158014087	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.493750295428	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
1.0	0.502279893566	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.500187513993	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.50227494179	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.500528277645	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.499946867746	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.491764526092	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.498130483942	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.501161927363	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.499824592773	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.502770920121	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.499228162923	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.496648319981	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.491642930887	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.498397710462	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.508823609043	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.499864903758	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.499961554109	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.493234230277	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.509838582866	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.500025119222	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.508101383894	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.499009127481	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.500287266797	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.499921676794	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.50076182812	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.504552172067	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.497260349442	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.500052549363	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.500267763164	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.490604806134	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
1.0	0.499923471925	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.501840554419	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.500026137826	Both served.
0.0	0.500805415105	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.501814188541	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.495456997749	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.499751502871	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.48854678198	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.491950144052	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.497975552516	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.503242874011	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.501307527257	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.494891183899	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.502678611647	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.499384247185	He does great.
0.0	0.501190901498	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.500731268536	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.506530889776	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.500040911216	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.503754177726	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.500733413878	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.499299235767	I love China.
0.0	0.498848121291	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.499251524602	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.501599613438	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.497563170009	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.49946772617	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.498977765484	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.497517419627	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.499099775901	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.499822384607	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.499699476108	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.498991148982	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.499043297673	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.499179699264	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.49876670187	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.489966211032	Illegal.
0.0	0.500165631309	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.501773157775	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.502966221524	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.498716670913	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.485244349808	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.498798121645	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.499515429487	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.502125340405	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.502540909545	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.500262151222	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.49929086691	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.500042880094	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.500072733727	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.502063641163	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.496341107169	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.499825332487	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.49908419211	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.492387283965	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.498918627812	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.500634750508	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
1.0	0.501846557667	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.499239936371	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.498870151493	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.491256643232	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.500100491283	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.499703241359	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.497450466737	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.507807898215	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.492036851724	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.500652624889	They cause dishonesty.
1.0	0.50377121238	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.504255181827	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.499731580733	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.499668575299	Here's a fact.
1.0	0.498017355457	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.499092976246	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.499446479418	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.499559775029	How about this?
0.0	0.488304568207	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.499688446282	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.499255688585	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.49580106094	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.49958507874	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.499350894384	So you know what?
0.0	0.499421199908	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.495094787048	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.499096089955	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.498669061202	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.499713402322	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.500494473449	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.504469750377	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.499582589034	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.499161195346	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.499464972409	That's the difference.
0.0	0.499599422158	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.499527911443	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.50252379125	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.497371717242	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.499335295326	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.484947858516	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.499796086771	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.505225655049	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.500224726591	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.499242399526	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.499545904786	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.499467649106	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.512365382306	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.498011677928	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.499922020902	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.500303898214	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.498256963231	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.500510826276	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.49967238386	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.496968971351	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.497226259009	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.498532173388	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.501942899279	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.498976112127	I would just say that...
0.0	0.499389510285	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.500182950081	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.499779148305	That's not true.
0.0	0.491398167974	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.499126488759	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.497064624437	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.50030408217	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.499544125582	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.499242017143	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.499168155635	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.499582423163	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.501667043277	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.502263951963	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.502091290161	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.501199228323	We put in place child care support.

0.0	0.490264272813	Ever.
0.0	0.498653434683	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.501829170461	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.498899618415	And you know what?
0.0	0.498414738867	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.504774385214	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.502304264078	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
1.0	0.499211672156	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.493304657817	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.499231488039	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.500368021366	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.49620894755	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.500926876138	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.499021796828	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.500242527183	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.499548548813	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.496423128155	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.498412577381	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.499142791926	I will not do that.
0.0	0.49936910784	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
1.0	0.501055666742	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.498849822647	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.499773324647	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.49559042275	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.487144653003	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.498368325826	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.498837856124	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.493288970217	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.500025042159	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.501061152856	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1.0	0.499860392221	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.499452771232	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.499913530079	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.49763766651	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.48993238261	John.
0.0	0.496633574674	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.500712968223	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.49857815114	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.499340627418	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.499475849249	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.499604477629	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.500222421992	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
1.0	0.500596431933	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.499702072874	His family certainly believes that.
1.0	0.49917157924	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.499784791451	She was right.
0.0	0.498428769533	And why?
0.0	0.500126756494	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.497701103726	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.496679407914	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.499347402072	That's not right.
0.0	0.500344153631	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.510771292215	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.500197601683	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.500733164344	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.505569344573	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.49987188615	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.49794991443	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.503698350315	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.500254432905	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.498661275526	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.490021010691	No.
0.0	0.497423327989	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.505320852062	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.495540735302	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.498993148766	That's right.
0.0	0.499533951238	The economy was really booming.
1.0	0.508986545471	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.503585197734	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.499504581989	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.499509233901	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.498781171762	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.493183713794	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.499063948921	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.499270179046	That has not been...
0.0	0.500666753169	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.497824579804	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.500613552423	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.503098107881	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.497691286186	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.491120247115	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.500226058655	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.495114584208	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.499304794134	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.495275192768	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.499623873772	The problem is we never get it done.
1.0	0.501048450924	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.490567313133	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.502470203308	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.499862253332	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.500179009909	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.500891770063	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.490968036582	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.500719781215	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.50178823719	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.50007563488	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.500565694637	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.503254479723	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.497558061565	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.497901042584	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.490899121945	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.500493810359	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.499719378006	You're right.
0.0	0.501530919645	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.512257514638	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.500673904146	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
1.0	0.500586609808	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.502272642678	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.499688189533	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.498662113338	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.500682217544	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.500966747137	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.500026284296	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.491599462117	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.500054993279	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.488626100365	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.498905705228	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.497474763633	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.503308096643	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.501318220605	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.499224331289	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.501423057854	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.49997990782	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.499765837212	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.499360881677	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.500807286851	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.498103658571	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.499871826142	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.500642603589	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.499398642041	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.500664972682	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.499524585242	Our next president...
0.0	0.499474261629	I've laid out...
0.0	0.500132202865	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.499291817724	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.500915984334	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.499366317557	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.501571502878	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.495011405174	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.500493892014	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.500772962771	Just for the record.
0.0	0.499074367694	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.499857250427	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.499046034058	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.504180328909	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.499083904105	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.496375000417	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.499908972602	He's wrong.
0.0	0.497734083351	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.490264272813	Right.
0.0	0.501261459329	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.499512308957	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.500045006357	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.499947605704	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.480303142929	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.499476199398	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.495780138505	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.499203542456	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.501474231328	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.500943851017	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.500629985648	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.500659321123	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.499281782315	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.50110357905	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.49943935301	That's fine.
0.0	0.498324635244	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.494499045062	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.499546227363	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.49935291486	...before I go.
0.0	0.500070848996	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.499722523421	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.501060479679	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.500773275088	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.500414212519	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.500052751819	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.498857165372	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.499452895426	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.499136056691	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.501349887914	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.498696958994	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.498427925644	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.503496117048	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.499739266878	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.500298407681	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.498522784923	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.498754823157	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.500505992438	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.503566275948	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.501245461936	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.500500221907	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.499827655558	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.498987264807	That's what he is.
0.0	0.499060578083	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.498739634543	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.499480697479	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.507447240717	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
1.0	0.500520884093	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.500090039356	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.499283909938	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.490964041396	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.496816948094	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.498091197212	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.5119434362	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.490994581119	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.499197327173	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.498692446544	We need sound money.
0.0	0.500121271223	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.48783826182	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.498261741531	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.499852520392	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.500013298219	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.498802595085	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.50767776875	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.498752430695	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.498695863217	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.499952300602	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.496598617326	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.498974886431	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.49293353302	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.49991574653	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.500032858242	A brief response.
0.0	0.498948735505	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.499625564757	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.499093706167	You did.
0.0	0.498330320036	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.497769288026	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.494325259857	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.499393972942	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.492865990942	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.498616798666	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.504947410731	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
1.0	0.499389334702	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.499420024829	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.499828066597	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.498673124876	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.497824843831	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
1.0	0.497235403771	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.500261777022	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.497530517439	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.493000888071	It feels different.
0.0	0.500818779652	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.493585068613	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.499638603218	I never said that.
0.0	0.498692039416	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.499003646142	Why is that?
0.0	0.499922973976	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.499949357712	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.497280015343	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.500861441761	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.499916122371	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.499287890272	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.494041180006	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.49888258086	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.500805225989	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.489661552446	OK?
0.0	0.499478265821	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.499388894051	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.499996720451	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.500199596627	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.508732187137	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.499930729665	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.499608032762	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.499452771232	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.50065508607	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.50019673713	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.502794176108	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.498890025438	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.499346121794	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.501071232658	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.502527104488	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.499653273076	Well, sure.
0.0	0.499608540507	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.499422036808	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.500632419368	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.508466665472	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.499293213952	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.498753104856	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.49900352758	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.498847241536	You just want to...
0.0	0.499642643233	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.498242786232	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.500563472266	I love this country.
0.0	0.499040243711	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.499600798009	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.498983108835	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.498096549022	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.499926414332	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.499877813158	Two points.
0.0	0.499625736052	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.490376275331	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.499001134602	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.499851244856	I changed that.
0.0	0.499134332004	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.499871423223	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.502572280629	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.511328547161	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.501770665658	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.497969984942	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.499662574102	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.499723620911	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.498313031302	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.503560229502	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.497793822094	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.500896905441	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.499269213457	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.495772261823	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.5015994927	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.504826042079	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
1.0	0.488657929484	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.499949200511	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
1.0	0.4969450197	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.500311242695	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.499376344645	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.490021010691	No.
0.0	0.502193323261	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.498353642862	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.492201739579	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.500240833289	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.500306802565	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.498802300794	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.501627927544	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.499875791811	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.493468809846	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.500422547584	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.500137890616	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.498392089212	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.502921249545	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.499429119999	Check it out.
0.0	0.500059086715	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.499738789586	They were wrong.
0.0	0.499780797755	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.500072311839	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.49396412568	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.503289080488	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
1.0	0.501781003407	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.496456253605	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.497857357831	No vision at all.
0.0	0.497185644559	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.500020670233	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.500347655515	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.500117312009	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.499765130781	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.501355696166	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.49875846967	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.499186253253	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.500332949557	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.499191720746	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.499642802806	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.505937111859	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.50187698966	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.499384920817	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.499785070089	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.498173198942	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.498644745837	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.497929928156	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.495331174907	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.497698435567	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.499137799514	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.500168779367	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.500713856038	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.500597536247	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.501028261347	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.500351958282	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.497536611278	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.499852112336	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
1.0	0.496240521062	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.504386615086	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.502863336364	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.499666206806	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.499486238695	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.501660213109	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.49929497841	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.49984407436	On welfare.
0.0	0.500221492595	I have no idea.
0.0	0.493247274734	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.500707103127	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.499222238573	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.498194353009	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.498202322738	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.501358309691	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.502331318612	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.495402322199	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.502638787805	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.499609989395	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.501495049072	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.512623209344	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.497586438094	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.4973020492	I want security.
0.0	0.497332799587	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.486565685393	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.489053924391	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.499891774025	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.499045396283	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.50032780477	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.500222354823	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.499504421346	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.

0.0	0.49950075084	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.505233971673	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.

0.0	0.499908831874	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.490264272813	Right.

0.0	0.501533198149	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.499014267885	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.504546339754	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.

0.0	0.500101053362	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.

0.0	0.502572568991	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.493158128238	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.500881986175	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.498919469664	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.50129246076	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.499714801059	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.501566943758	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.

0.0	0.499517199453	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.507142794759	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.49960699246	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.500059464592	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.49790100214	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.498611844234	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.498956255284	My point is this.
0.0	0.499341488967	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.496963601397	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.498765633366	I think he is right.
0.0	0.498899618415	And you know what?
0.0	0.499018271307	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.498113764251	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.499093706167	It was.
0.0	0.499516464581	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.512424950494	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.498508170191	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.499024999876	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.499760714101	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
1.0	0.510118442292	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.499480738094	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.487428642601	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.507423630906	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.498412283115	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.499783309151	Credibility counts.

0.0	0.492927553286	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.500042650083	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.499969312987	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.50130798725	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.510370924231	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.498394367854	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.499889294146	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.49867218843	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.500590543213	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.496998625969	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.499951779878	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.501670889121	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.503740244493	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.500515651987	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.499567723311	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.497354552359	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.494052062198	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.501138091858	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.502296634146	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.499784791451	I didn't.
0.0	0.499906767665	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.503121031813	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.505642925914	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.499098294747	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.499055923262	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.498992745626	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.501887888378	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.501020745545	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.497068470453	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.499428783535	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
1.0	0.500613085335	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.499019473909	We have to do something.
0.0	0.499832530646	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.496860901896	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.504736932333	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.500380921041	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.499737223561	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.499339426994	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.49613542193	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.499756388661	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.500064378997	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.49953267526	He undermines it.
0.0	0.499868357421	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.49978277117	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.503813369498	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.496784021808	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.501134654973	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.500183022431	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.487118345217	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.499621678074	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.499538756214	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.50248244221	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.499498992039	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.500010051214	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.501256122944	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.490272215719	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.500111695392	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.502865468365	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.497025263022	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.500335191109	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.500096184794	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.502859307783	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.499686400358	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.500231259664	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.495211944661	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.502442594523	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.499482306063	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.50220881194	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.50011138564	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.492412373105	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.500723377115	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.500648236056	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.50019330503	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.501375671972	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.499642008941	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.49748584982	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.497899872308	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.50024035651	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.501215142009	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.5008292563	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.499960263856	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.500557866317	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.501786130548	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.500102066424	So we have work to do.

0.0	0.50015268161	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.500939129569	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.

0.0	0.500014033338	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.49547821985	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.496738998159	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.508268517035	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.491663766224	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.498820479868	...income tax...
0.0	0.499860734639	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.50993543982	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.4995389711	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.491817176522	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.486649661078	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.499877676957	You bet they do.
0.0	0.49950015785	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
1.0	0.498158192383	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.502762659123	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.500058501929	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.498451863365	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.499694685274	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.504999276241	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.

0.0	0.49959538393	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.500408922368	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.499243472339	She said the truth.
0.0	0.497592564446	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.500594830828	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.502470989278	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.499301508371	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.499957528845	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.500420073242	I said no.
0.0	0.498522626086	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.50283228836	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.491021587901	And loose money is one of the major problems.

0.0	0.500304392213	We're running.
0.0	0.495465876102	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
1.0	0.502118529094	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.513411064108	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.497691752252	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.500790564972	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.497242177629	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.500145853152	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.495701079069	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.

0.0	0.501034776306	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.498994669033	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.491024396968	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.501060232497	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.498589256472	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.498222371069	And here's why.
0.0	0.499605498337	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.500307419715	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.494538606157	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.496572151669	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.50329947387	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
1.0	0.499468398234	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.497746811031	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.500435144853	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.497413873246	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.490696664943	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.500129443465	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.500905765766	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.493718742224	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.497499769695	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.48993238261	Alright.
0.0	0.499868412552	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.498539307	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.491373008849	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.502089776343	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.502468037394	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.499448578719	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.49996324771	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.500528771891	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.501486188116	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
1.0	0.499302736488	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.50055980945	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.491846736698	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.500468845366	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.499387357859	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.500079930502	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.500809838042	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.499398186505	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.499279051141	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.499697794227	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.499567732043	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.501235451831	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.500956702467	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.498658633485	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.500291735616	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.499529864641	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.502352883323	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.498455397333	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.502226306028	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.494492609639	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.500536249443	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.498838945874	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.498493955383	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.505591667402	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.499474472736	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.499513478985	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.499943586121	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.498090078203	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.499865462479	We can't do it.
0.0	0.500904939372	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.499015384965	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.500075867493	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.498811504028	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.502816639053	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.498041793856	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.499617388869	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.505291942127	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.501447248633	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.499647299551	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.499749759957	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.495083790714	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.502580888218	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.493982991542	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.49976209773	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.505991708275	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.506008715337	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.499105875965	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.494887166874	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.49927880148	I would change them.
0.0	0.500862523385	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.500493823985	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.499271964528	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.500685988423	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.499154633769	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.500325309175	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.499683940885	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.500546657927	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.500965721503	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
1.0	0.499464842714	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.500898825814	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.497918285686	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.500905534884	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.498872485259	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
1.0	0.49890737188	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.497557901454	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.506414149763	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.489661552446	Yeah.
0.0	0.498263000745	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.499214202919	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.501160750308	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.499835127514	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.502401665233	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.507269208627	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.497091858077	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.499774819589	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.499799058655	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.499139334594	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.501994368279	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.500086256583	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.499835722125	I was not at all.
1.0	0.498978126075	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.495263862245	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.497360160134	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.499535662578	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.499774843866	I'm ready.
0.0	0.506034180777	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.499294660362	...Thank you.
0.0	0.501092709812	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.500031359075	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.491296584831	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.496939762062	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.500388798757	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.493997840044	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.4985499863	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.499638603218	I never said that.
0.0	0.502152164128	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.493163002831	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.501648482656	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.498198137803	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.499933584823	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.499734113637	He is a good man.
0.0	0.510236861784	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.504656987413	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.504863047999	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.497641257159	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.494552394283	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.498569411547	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
1.0	0.500850431821	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.500208743732	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.489632159322	...
0.0	0.500319161267	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.501304555813	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.499697310338	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.506250671047	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.

0.0	0.501359864675	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.501152409052	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.49927553843	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.498902747227	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.

1.0	0.500109338299	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.501184011098	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.

0.0	0.500113796879	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.498237361406	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.

0.0	0.500269298224	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.500678553972	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.499560402808	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.496450243981	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.501261107465	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.508778651352	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.500017063601	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.502622476314	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.500859371919	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.

0.0	0.500106567859	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.498371454184	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.496452839684	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.499467117406	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
1.0	0.499385637865	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.502003478244	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.499655286859	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.498748003904	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.500857614227	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.490636998713	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.497589457192	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.499253645507	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.503168976007	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.

0.0	0.501086622352	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.496060119472	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.500263394683	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.498586439475	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.500193319536	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.499503588029	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
1.0	0.502915973513	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.48774474589	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.499224774578	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.501129000291	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
1.0	0.505824343486	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.508350619546	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.499498928935	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.504391442336	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.499434293588	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.508261283415	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.499619112755	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.498872974216	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.

0.0	0.501791281799	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.498102869042	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.500458094488	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.511033968668	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.499766927504	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.508255221829	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.50435436084	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.499163612742	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.499371450875	We cannot be the world's policeman.
1.0	0.505673641624	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.501295831455	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.500172570903	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.508731651442	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.500643969381	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.498015079971	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.498118887609	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.498615096418	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.499192266432	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.495291828773	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.508674574005	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.501930186579	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.497776302331	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.500176431637	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.499434213945	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.499279106691	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.498289297865	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.499074915431	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.497036474731	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.496515481921	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.496133429808	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.499418412848	OK, good.
0.0	0.499770982884	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.499009295783	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.498073598418	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.500107171973	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.495404061528	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.50449257558	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.495200645104	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.497820596608	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.50231780644	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.498564848229	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.501560681908	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.500552834055	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.49586571244	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.500299988806	You have to lead.
0.0	0.490264272813	Right.
0.0	0.499429426215	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.49934075599	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.499372950752	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.500040605862	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.500579420985	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.501150103229	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.501753001325	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.500471754785	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.493845620384	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.49201544665	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.500634658817	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.495698164021	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.499706279708	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.500504578454	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.500261938248	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.503721543293	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.499478931486	That is important.
0.0	0.492419044288	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.500012328801	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.500499198899	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.500349165392	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.500487198623	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
1.0	0.502312442528	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.497994320695	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.499427791664	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.501504665222	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.496943009421	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.501579315198	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.513090189059	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.498181231188	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.498932113849	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.499290449356	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.49906541889	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.498714900424	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.499371292103	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.501485736768	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.500410238049	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.49940909595	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.499348285891	I would change them.
0.0	0.50081016759	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.498489680194	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.500341236209	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.5013913076	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.497927014005	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.499429029009	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.499994443437	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.498043887097	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.498476092018	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.499177881316	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.49974066468	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.500992089917	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.497899727433	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.502244272167	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.501584415037	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.499692321714	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.49816696145	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.501154070682	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.500042908631	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.500342541852	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.500750649576	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.498718964802	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.499801567952	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.499426576963	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.499578578879	No their not.
0.0	0.493408777997	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.499279334917	They're a scam.
0.0	0.486262725066	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.49995311741	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.499398637916	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.489661552446	Okay.
0.0	0.50041848935	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.499600612306	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.500883904339	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.496867538989	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.499765704	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.498331330889	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.499902579304	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.498947515591	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.499216179758	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.499751190712	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.499636379556	I've done it.
0.0	0.49908600526	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.498707172681	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.488991750482	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.494257724093	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.499268329923	I can do that.
1.0	0.497227950429	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.49853736303	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.499616898144	We were wrong.
0.0	0.499719378006	You're right.
1.0	0.502580295798	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.492731264206	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.506184492339	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.498282274276	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.502149061699	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.500871000874	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.499733693697	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.50024023763	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.499538718096	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.49974812335	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.500145283583	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.498465943105	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.50596456336	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.496634733358	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.500194659961	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.499226164266	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.499967326587	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.499274037402	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.499293299499	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.498166960833	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.498908662584	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.500742000661	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
1.0	0.497213981313	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.495564151595	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.501016996368	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.500915505692	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.499784791451	Well, I did.
0.0	0.490780697902	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.500007923263	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.49928972803	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.500653270856	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.499010720967	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.497524232766	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.500183219089	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.500476934491	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.499119167823	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.497991382685	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.498741851971	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.510375068631	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.498679965444	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.498515236532	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.493372700715	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.502224669314	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.494115221909	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.499541434854	No, you did.
0.0	0.500782838213	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.500063434452	Yeah, they are unhinged.
1.0	0.5003481126	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.502114996738	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.495718501659	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.499587623082	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.499122196093	And we are not England.
0.0	0.501256353103	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.499545461312	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.502700626993	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.493675369794	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.50077634146	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.503190653338	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.491962288452	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.502418444659	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.499999406751	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.500368118033	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.499860665432	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.498061202483	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.503141706407	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.500127294228	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.500933537336	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.499672539572	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.500234662291	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.500006872496	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.499180112979	How do I know this?
0.0	0.504755304564	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.500722896734	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.495794565293	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.499148466937	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.497778489936	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.498506796137	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.508992618877	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.501690630698	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.502853462213	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.50167879681	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.500101319583	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.50090199889	You count on it.
0.0	0.501635458505	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.501002142798	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.502351253112	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.499220909414	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.501211647243	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.498899618415	And you know what?
0.0	0.499923071988	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.499965181614	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.50038673292	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.492544096587	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.495667925398	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.500932452839	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.500123338692	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.504361322532	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.499022145357	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.4946372385	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.491871892826	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.498775736322	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.497663038799	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.499934086823	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.498664567274	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.497904254418	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.500018854871	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.494192592781	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.499461687138	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.489995982213	See?
0.0	0.503085436688	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.499148718636	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.500617747594	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.499864306054	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.505231196104	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.499758740822	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.497961091398	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.499257299059	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.500352467786	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.503622159949	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.499093712569	But we stuck to our message.
1.0	0.504599956667	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.502320300497	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.497359474464	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.497985903629	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.499592985771	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.499713474604	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.502373930739	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.499272702629	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.498233673666	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.499702998865	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.500573501041	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.49917246924	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.501624443841	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.499624481179	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.498350957013	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.500825925885	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.499549186187	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.502364424833	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.501661232468	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.499805551682	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.499874207358	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.500262415676	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.499536033433	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.499733686985	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.499765935432	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.489770355315	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.478766293658	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.499987853844	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.499006429984	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.504322600714	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.498340598858	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.500465765838	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.501072893257	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.489024420782	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.499153724584	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.501001442584	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.499604011635	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.493745367	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.499750913024	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.499390845853	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.498842363368	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.498329511246	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.501277544439	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.499942238224	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
1.0	0.50145660726	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.499934935389	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.508662752279	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.494385249257	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.499070154341	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.499528237417	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.499301890388	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.500450295323	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.500493886085	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.495280736483	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.500165628467	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.500259869026	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.500563405729	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.490264272813	Dynamically.
0.0	0.499584961754	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.491465298821	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.502892571972	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.499364869322	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.500991830408	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.499892068056	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
1.0	0.500040621795	That's wrong.
0.0	0.50887948803	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.499671237851	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.50203775556	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.50087561966	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.499272702629	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.489661552446	Yes.
0.0	0.499362122009	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.503209343496	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.500537748376	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.499488144406	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.508400547159	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.500065196859	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.5023396622	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.498843232796	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.499719802061	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.502134914138	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.502643939512	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.498143881038	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.504134531598	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.491503703404	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.491203227126	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.5004475724	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.498929534271	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.500389977203	Well, let us level with the American people.
1.0	0.501191251861	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.499402186514	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.499597887	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.490021010691	No.
1.0	0.486081569925	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.499114582996	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.498798659996	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.500882532708	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.499845264096	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.499430051466	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.500560439903	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.500471754785	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.497617363134	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.497462164457	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.503633900542	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.500806614638	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.501400924602	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.498982917495	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.499758970016	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.499828472619	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.488272269625	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.49791799727	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.499276272869	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.499269916263	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.498433791919	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.499628993093	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.501672416616	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.498870484962	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.494034554608	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.498686071166	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.500180225669	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.501220841728	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.496365007278	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.500789995282	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.498822153888	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.502994059574	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.494159487644	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.500378869344	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.499553392889	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.500726115324	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.499295423256	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.498912792868	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.499021795848	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.49863361776	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.498787448608	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.499584768593	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.500032653313	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.502447825666	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.489099997386	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
1.0	0.500762488958	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.499093669768	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.496461737562	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.499434817378	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.498361365018	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.508111866401	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.498732826229	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.49875846967	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.498951892711	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.500044919174	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.491229882868	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.500578795212	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.503104009814	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.49763783032	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.499202721795	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.50081156744	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.501042219819	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.499969955531	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.499818684941	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.500289056702	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.49748274806	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.499218001201	You can have him.
0.0	0.499796447799	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.500159183345	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.499727959953	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.499363420405	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.49899903276	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.495318359198	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.499855036944	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.499521431313	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.499790621605	The world has changed.
0.0	0.499833421747	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.498453347104	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.499382445207	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.497962628175	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.502034270942	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.499149893193	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.501271467151	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.50065493836	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.498434066989	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.499266432919	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.49987426946	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.500205670505	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.50101446541	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.500484604171	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.494538831639	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.501614978516	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.498519303026	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.501233902966	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.501108132167	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.498193471753	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.49864413591	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.513347118703	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.500821866712	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.49946444408	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.499958592362	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.499056201125	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.497815979913	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.491549617978	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.499787533792	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.499647506197	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.501320587143	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.498191394927	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.499630489601	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.489661552446	Yes.
0.0	0.499658515726	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.494651899686	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.497441310433	Big difference.
0.0	0.49903828194	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.499928565988	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.500009904944	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.501275068587	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.49885689847	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.499842524626	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.500372271874	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.499574770794	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.499867498631	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.50224464982	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.498899618415	And you know what?
0.0	0.499749232403	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.501049767553	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.499034205837	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.489661552446	OK.
0.0	0.497884155329	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.499972569052	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.499714228408	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.508917505716	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.497602928904	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.498696745254	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.50009652273	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.501357873992	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.511373034236	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.499764490037	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.498887528599	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.492933023834	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.499351051427	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.499293045525	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.499361057277	We don't need that.
0.0	0.496656965976	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.499279934675	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.50078598169	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.49967606387	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.499768721655	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.502403168531	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.498692446544	We need sound money.
0.0	0.500209431092	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.498472743591	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.489543576029	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.500828740656	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.497814675529	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.492276337117	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.500742244996	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
1.0	0.500567167627	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.499247529812	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.498006882968	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.498023110611	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.498899618415	And you know what?
0.0	0.499771574873	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.499308264651	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.50295849224	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.503877517829	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.502806183605	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.502383644488	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.499534177483	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.498194866811	...John...
0.0	0.49768032503	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.500048938542	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.500484158194	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.49919793675	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.490090359671	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.513708113165	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.501009116021	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.49933472029	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.499453095776	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.492704178352	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.490402353023	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.503446528062	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.499427589985	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.499013398222	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.500071831682	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.502836817197	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.499467346105	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.498323207282	Maria, I'd just like to say...
1.0	0.498649797713	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.498287189725	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.491259661977	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.499745042319	We actually did it.
0.0	0.497424792239	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.501177265763	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.498062076725	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.493520277132	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.497858601	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.500075081492	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.509593030588	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.487888923795	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.502541000562	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.49943935301	That's fine.
0.0	0.494727322545	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.499895400158	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.499601244006	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.491583013943	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.500376102265	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.499562697836	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.499866582082	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.500101893126	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.499239966906	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.510428459461	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.502325917385	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.498496208466	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.497431925136	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.499830054135	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.512854814135	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.498891194012	And so do I.
0.0	0.49921429582	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.488345829925	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.497848589356	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.501818016499	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.498290211928	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.490592848675	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.484338099457	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.499535552178	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.507661274783	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.491127432039	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.498864435706	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
1.0	0.501305178018	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.49469834974	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.498053600339	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.498962753757	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.499831889042	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.509109256985	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.500825180648	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.500781137069	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.504779519404	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.499133367328	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.499505131531	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
1.0	0.500721908113	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.500921127287	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.502970100141	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.497970538735	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.490875429051	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.498972680071	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.499677978677	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.499643377293	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.505950654207	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.500963756155	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.500229522022	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.492496591276	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.498052334517	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.498896468222	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.492142053627	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
1.0	0.500503094222	Very few children.
0.0	0.50167878809	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.498866876246	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.494271791078	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.499745109249	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.498159144704	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
1.0	0.500406462516	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.499983731316	I agree with them.
0.0	0.502951004194	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.496251581163	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.498484048404	You looking at me?
0.0	0.499745259166	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.497298707616	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.

0.0	0.498800092922	I think the times are much more serious.
1.0	0.501982057206	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.499790087057	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.501036416803	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.489202097412	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?

0.0	0.499004824399	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.499538565343	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.499033879921	In addition to that...
0.0	0.497520203986	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.498214754587	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.500440535485	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.490021010691	No.
0.0	0.49958149573	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.498779499718	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.491771511975	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.489178497468	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.505206334858	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.494431691545	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.

0.0	0.499295770639	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
1.0	0.500408893733	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.498820602036	I can.
0.0	0.49061648409	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.501890965384	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.499744904943	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.500289775239	This is 2016.
0.0	0.499682716489	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.511115450466	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.495835576847	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.501355952948	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.498455652685	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.500760169758	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.499638603218	I never said that.
0.0	0.500469917361	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.499370848291	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.500281981477	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.497721379076	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.492713053289	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.499343639611	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.500607316416	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.499591504022	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.498779000025	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.497796111427	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.500019135692	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.48802942219	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.498772189877	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.501604855617	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.497635422976	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.491272304916	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.498508304351	I think you're --
0.0	0.498982298511	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
1.0	0.509922566196	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.502636264323	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.49980254804	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.498589262981	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.500388585957	He was on the board.
0.0	0.496231759921	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
1.0	0.499904082612	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.499260403212	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.500202433487	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.49911612331	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.499279135303	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.497746046393	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.493689763697	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.499220682129	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.499355972717	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.499769907152	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.515859187935	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.499168858283	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.499722201585	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.497692555496	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.498730951311	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.500143619858	I know every one.
0.0	0.499083999659	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.499444279775	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.500219482112	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.500002316193	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.490856336831	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.4999657364	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.500250364125	You find me...
0.0	0.499136113821	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.495486806081	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.500981435892	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.499996368356	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.497488786868	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.494805553688	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.499873124917	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.496999330516	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.499106259096	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.500696948101	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.490021010691	No.
0.0	0.489261200428	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.498438053547	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.500962574327	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.504808732357	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.486238351243	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.500915874922	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
1.0	0.497654619705	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.500607099085	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.49941056782	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.498890618373	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.497539889321	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.499691158216	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.498560819939	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.500732275436	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.500711392158	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.499145063405	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.499660574452	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.499405590563	But I was born here.
0.0	0.499831533369	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.499553280377	In all due respect...
0.0	0.49919045633	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.492942677456	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.495950809756	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.489013988227	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.504458617173	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.499801490964	We have no borders.
0.0	0.499502084944	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.499935685888	I win.
0.0	0.499751174378	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.499716119243	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.498059570873	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.498949550289	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.502104503925	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.499566732428	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.500659449029	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.502153888298	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.499921236807	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.499809208676	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.501464394476	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.499537601041	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.501121836338	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
1.0	0.501415808208	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.499511674557	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.498770249862	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.500924380766	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.500968651692	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.500776186881	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.500228647296	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.500213128425	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.499694716416	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.499347402072	That's not right.
1.0	0.504343318838	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.499076461739	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.49953926186	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.505514020444	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.500573952941	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.499612685994	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.50044631054	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.506401432094	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.499781489322	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.500134861677	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.501826766481	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.499598722257	Think about that.
0.0	0.504385283008	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.490889876844	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.499612262613	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.497670866642	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.493301313068	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.497966188551	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.498184265841	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.499830371135	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.49890602144	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.501007662399	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.502047642976	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.502251320539	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.490765724112	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.500754817855	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.499931274925	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.497304848325	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.499875032477	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.499019607814	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.499573683797	Think about it.
0.0	0.499619225833	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.499140046295	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.499187007972	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.499975373749	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.494541918438	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.497323780458	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.499211290573	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.498655792964	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.499469170611	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.499284113305	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.500271220286	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.499767828956	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.499855878904	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.500707714771	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.500460838695	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.499312170229	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.505037186582	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.49788527163	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.504444308673	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.505537942931	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.504427189456	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.502389123383	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
1.0	0.500158794112	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.500409626042	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.499815492182	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.497107261011	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.501026634049	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
1.0	0.500422482601	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.500111917739	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.499398427237	It goes away.
0.0	0.504696435236	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.50657813243	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.499135431302	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.499467514828	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.502744141961	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.499566538295	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.49997039645	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.498799619047	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.497386361009	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.500054847225	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.50138451257	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.49981606858	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.498999181298	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.499159610017	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.495137605625	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.500389298051	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.499464051499	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.499403763986	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.499255392808	That's for sure.
0.0	0.500262531708	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.506883733943	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.500133310486	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.49911440754	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.497777568125	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.499180498726	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.500513625024	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.500587579179	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.499140289795	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.497825223515	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.499306480199	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.499591161468	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.501130707598	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.498464400472	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.500022908581	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.499907933228	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.499674745036	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.501588662572	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.490924301941	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.489632159322	...
0.0	0.500190669644	They're a scam.
0.0	0.498758138255	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.500478964062	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
1.0	0.500446101318	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.499379153141	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.481200976415	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.498661275526	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.497547172499	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.501191820691	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.49986961713	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.502435275004	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.496840252097	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.4908174527	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.500063627463	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
1.0	0.512078754958	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.499650466249	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.499963454439	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.500569305849	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.494177756975	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.500041287509	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.499366705407	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.49965812063	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.490759796646	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.499771590896	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.500643611825	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.489274826351	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.498880660449	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.501163932635	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.491172620299	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.498174416353	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.49766528366	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.499406741147	You're welcome.
0.0	0.499013834212	They know.
0.0	0.49822202882	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.500820885131	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.496795105636	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.500524920995	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.499821292932	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.500756549087	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.503078632382	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.493354522526	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.501034664001	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.490408822362	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.498778360314	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.496476256932	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.500186909317	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.500688707102	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.500453208959	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.487745222593	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.501631363517	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.499426707809	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.499882025162	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.501059238326	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.499793479011	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.498579318873	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.500289948013	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.501410895441	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.506161465615	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.503480540906	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.49490570987	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.499200859704	You know why?
0.0	0.499734113637	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.499074081546	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.498180149478	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
1.0	0.500656798289	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.499241716377	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.503085446718	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.498993068996	I will do that.
0.0	0.499324006288	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.499322454043	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.49880649372	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.499870184974	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
1.0	0.499491800646	In the past he has called him weak.
1.0	0.501734614611	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.500517171938	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.50059586768	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.499165250276	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.499850561273	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.499899574001	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.492626133041	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.499007878477	And, we said no.
0.0	0.499046845177	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.49083402423	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.498961727504	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.508397291447	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.500027205295	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.492635303766	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.500303218916	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.502117622647	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.499092983503	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.502990330381	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.500039923807	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.499663047359	We don't win.
0.0	0.499462699791	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.493377652872	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.497872494338	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.497302928891	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.496725757323	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
1.0	0.497447277028	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.499718005899	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.499630506799	Not bad.
1.0	0.500168315134	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.497863439138	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.505630241242	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.502191120326	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.499337097496	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.490877311743	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.496782876308	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.501464293261	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.506135781189	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.498750548019	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.499743634791	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.498624645087	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.499719378006	We haven't.
0.0	0.502522471921	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.498778921866	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.499980348187	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.500294490839	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.499242018757	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.500386097078	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.489632159322	...
0.0	0.489087049903	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.499604311743	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.501708523471	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.487485252588	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.501314015366	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.501760527921	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.499890067421	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.502362877305	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.497568309373	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.499841922372	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.500220851244	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.498564933167	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.499755993623	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
1.0	0.500847199263	It looked like very few women.
1.0	0.504235895216	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.499242767254	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.507860874976	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.499432402123	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.491567010051	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.503327955599	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.486981701639	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.499231316774	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.498782500183	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.500566694222	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.500338379271	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.499259768697	That will change everything.
0.0	0.499069882839	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.492597698558	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.499111919989	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.491313326602	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.498327936605	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.492308661084	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.501506803204	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.499814971694	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.500737548355	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.500763829754	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.499945117416	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.500870639463	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.499487692847	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.501603144725	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.49909286693	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.498033890145	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.499289755918	Nobody can deny them.
1.0	0.500514654851	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.498230745029	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.500058686641	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.50234850617	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.499693534908	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.500447460654	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.499685798955	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.499581195164	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.4997364335	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.495893765789	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.50597545869	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.498873233136	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.499064125777	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.499325369122	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.49521829095	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.499002908314	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.499184594102	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.499623528125	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.499966250241	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.499501694715	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.491341961849	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.500136988573	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.500205419889	(inaudible).
0.0	0.499125455298	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.50071545519	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.493541530177	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.497246309688	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.502895117487	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.499727388407	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.499101276355	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.50086551909	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.489661552446	OK?
0.0	0.49961448827	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.488794717168	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.506621068938	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.499636949137	Well, thank you very much.
1.0	0.501456253416	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.502850354216	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.499644577844	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.498344784601	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.506711128683	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.497197766379	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.4992640943	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.499141514384	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.499516341501	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.499782408309	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.499459252354	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.500124460915	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.499398427237	It never happens.
0.0	0.501545819681	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.500469667491	That never works.
0.0	0.50092311138	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.504124192416	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.499043376187	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.499611888955	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.499915646917	My name was mentioned here.
1.0	0.505297859572	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.503148469896	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.500516674235	I'm tested.
0.0	0.500398963592	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.499424111271	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.495336701366	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.50175810478	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.498391853064	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.49900180839	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.500626231141	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.490570632038	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.500275533637	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.500204658386	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.499179662773	They're off to China.
0.0	0.498316152476	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.499944366798	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.491057137118	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.493398995211	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.503293154854	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.498676567683	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.498844152783	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.498572609274	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.494158338157	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.492352459491	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.500679218378	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.487590190719	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.498946607022	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.501154906015	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.501978576657	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.499241025808	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.499398427237	It never happens.
0.0	0.499276699831	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.500818355878	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.496613865011	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.49331611774	I was the architect.
0.0	0.497634854472	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.5077874061	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.499089871486	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.500708455846	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.500131389635	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.499722920271	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.489648813839	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.501094514779	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.499099376583	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.499422180767	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.499031727471	That is our government today.
0.0	0.499773059303	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.495086259914	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.500776155822	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.489661552446	OK?
0.0	0.501542403483	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.499580075729	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.49943240372	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.498368410991	That is...
0.0	0.500578315007	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.49961603527	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.500099627128	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.504799632122	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
1.0	0.494382510953	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.507553856918	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.498901563293	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.499298205363	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.499273109417	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.499200859704	You know why?
0.0	0.500337798068	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.499464226108	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.497797947625	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.502026649852	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.499334794068	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.499042736829	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.498627393717	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.499393870786	to save a company.
0.0	0.500030482593	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.505090399019	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.496994341659	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.498821616861	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.490796422324	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.499215794369	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.498994018113	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.495482938774	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.499429119999	Check it out.
0.0	0.502381983652	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.498124364831	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.499550611995	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.503252834933	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.500244109781	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.510652923988	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.500280816817	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.499190517393	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.497964380351	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.499435680921	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.499683278223	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.498194866811	...Chris...
0.0	0.508906693695	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.499599549819	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.496026507994	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.500244897575	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.500267960683	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.49763783032	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.499807075344	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.491726916241	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.497586438094	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.500376403871	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.500326040772	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
1.0	0.502254868665	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.50078554655	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.504546339754	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
1.0	0.502583266036	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.499760343327	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.498991973553	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.499550772295	No, no.
0.0	0.496393643888	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.501692287354	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.497152169822	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.499530886758	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.499334489375	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
1.0	0.49894467043	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.499129172143	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.499121619586	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.496953483422	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.503841099096	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."

0.0	0.498680549254	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.502447759544	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.499818896178	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
1.0	0.500458827236	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.

0.0	0.493418381234	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.499862549365	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.501066595871	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.499302742607	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.501552917818	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.499068489628	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.499816344438	Just ditto to that.

1.0	0.49795652058	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.505570926913	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.505016706206	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.

0.0	0.500514059104	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.49981808518	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.500474164797	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.50138676091	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.498899618415	And you know what?
0.0	0.503173106079	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
1.0	0.504669078	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.497776302331	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.498871189931	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.500365230894	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.500137845784	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.498955336124	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.499609304382	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.494602524802	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
1.0	0.500099176246	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.499576982158	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.500006777274	They have to come into this country legally.
1.0	0.500401558291	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.489603421617	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.499762172711	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
1.0	0.503976614003	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.499643474087	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.500817977612	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.500048938542	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.502705129473	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.502817703843	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.498649580093	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.49969968103	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.500049896351	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.497807333974	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.498188769344	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.499926272861	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.487878405292	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.50010604427	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.501130472421	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.499935638422	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.503071817916	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.49302642125	The answer is no.
0.0	0.503134048042	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.501297003564	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.49957678144	What have you got now?
0.0	0.499825481689	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.499400029382	You know that.
0.0	0.49955409944	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.498844064837	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.498794985135	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.500662397227	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.501289251925	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.500654118001	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.497201513957	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.500752600507	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.499754047598	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.503456058852	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.491641182868	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.499800648531	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.488717261148	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.488814762726	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.498909633694	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.499064441547	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.499307754894	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.495880393723	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.498635156594	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.499187423127	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.498873562951	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.502032433907	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.498661275526	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.495702525068	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.505149276596	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.499185750132	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.493581492484	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.50044835371	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.503068228169	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.49975379228	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.498420785351	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.49047934064	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.50247286245	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.496050427242	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.49995365562	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.495580216256	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.500080158257	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.500225556179	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.501686017267	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.497623588977	I have no illusion.
1.0	0.50002924461	They were wrong.
0.0	0.498951681856	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.501316871929	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.50053343324	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.500480853542	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.503184881237	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.505169219208	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.49508162081	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.490674647696	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.499385082181	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.499821941654	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.499146757263	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.497545835879	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.488262049455	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.499844215704	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.493648590149	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.500240469378	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.500312445876	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.502921273704	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.499447010754	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.502982430501	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.500075155291	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
1.0	0.499469584318	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.485945036198	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.496587339168	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.495692759813	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.496720468142	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.499747981439	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.500041262188	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.500157987822	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.500557532173	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.499960265649	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.493567944186	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.490725127368	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.499937935123	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.500203332182	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.499781116564	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.496493212272	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.500010388069	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.500810927828	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.500763085732	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.499227610904	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.498368677198	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.500537307887	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.502987794	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.503469140806	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.499295378603	That's my bill.
0.0	0.499274824374	Say again?
0.0	0.499748708949	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.491926513115	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.50013177086	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.500226498078	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.500340890905	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.500618979612	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.500224794882	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.500495048765	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.497494665161	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.496231852981	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.497942716798	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.499251261264	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.502278867638	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.500179863963	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.500060980076	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.500016684974	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.

0.0	0.499443277387	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.49834483868	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.499161005428	I like it.
0.0	0.502156370343	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.500165602668	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.499763357338	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.498483655452	Now, we're going to blame the people.
1.0	0.505036083866	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.500474912598	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.4958081592	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.508235213145	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.489880386798	Creativity.
0.0	0.501060541175	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.498801289393	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.497486248503	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.501167658486	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.497940951945	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.498661424086	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.495384874544	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.499997643523	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.500817453358	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.489238955501	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.498730170501	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.499071372878	How great is that?
0.0	0.497979441732	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.499426033302	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.489476064375	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.491723844969	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.496826129314	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.501367180895	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.49878268339	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.499533972348	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.501911366433	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.50063320209	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.498986988329	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.490333431275	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.498952244889	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.508778929412	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.500985746825	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.49734075904	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.498713649202	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.497669134693	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.499136113821	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.503755095653	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.499243435667	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.501488123932	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.499753541768	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.49817938781	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.500739041689	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.49531943096	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.498814054512	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.497432684929	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.499841575411	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.498882409057	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.499655042714	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.499668732594	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.498302543314	We can't do this unilaterally.
1.0	0.502662119188	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.499319803408	And for good cause.
0.0	0.49882979002	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.504762505192	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.501149103616	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.503385099506	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.503005789777	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.498982385185	It's their money.
0.0	0.510633862511	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.500421121172	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.502888832577	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.497391267747	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.500163013444	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.49913207808	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.500471953252	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.495699141482	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.497465985791	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.498578309369	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.496093043385	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.500628489476	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.499806481712	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.497695322594	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.500255145546	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.498912155152	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.499746963847	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.497452677351	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.49909916875	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.494444252385	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.498153634628	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.503000773242	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.499470337223	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.501022036253	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.510982918845	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.499993679667	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.500217259445	I totally get that.
0.0	0.500481688682	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.500196909279	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.50113344497	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.499047112398	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.500715632906	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.493154198416	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.491440350033	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.507061005054	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.499158294325	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.503463540775	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.499041494241	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.50134732404	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.500475941594	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.498714633791	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.497653168207	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.499914657184	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.499993415817	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.494941092632	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.499541829504	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.500964244583	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.498404587403	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.501917702719	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.503525293315	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.503114337249	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.502187849509	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.499734060373	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.498743370207	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.

0.0	0.499191156229	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.

0.0	0.501051143756	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.498279233993	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.49988775306	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.509339769477	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.501183024769	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.

0.0	0.501289802928	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.49990719153	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.499413020158	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.4992209559	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.503670750023	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.499069019675	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.500201786919	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.

0.0	0.499885531034	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.499791396262	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.500375068133	The natural next question is who actually has done so.

0.0	0.5039345736	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.499510866102	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.499250686443	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.484291777181	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.499204530756	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.499810145041	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.499981498372	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.499868718093	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.499967740695	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.500300164899	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.498069928744	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.500766154443	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.499969140991	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.488521584688	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.499865462479	I can't do it.
0.0	0.500032127417	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.

0.0	0.502928846471	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.

0.0	0.501653357276	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.499955374977	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.499729990092	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.499051741491	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.

0.0	0.49904367662	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.478280743151	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.499983662824	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.500546088247	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.498596097869	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.49840134806	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.499965984965	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.497917415184	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.50050837555	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.495483356207	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
1.0	0.502769625897	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.

0.0	0.498636934634	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.493480009325	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.499077998845	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...

1.0	0.5107343414	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.

0.0	0.50096184478	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.499408704032	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.500909765062	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.497364423534	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.499706992448	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.502503970278	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.500401220859	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.

0.0	0.497342531567	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.500915526696	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.499655752796	We are not France.

0.0	0.500091934507	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.499365494856	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.499934404971	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.498723116667	They do whatever what they do, OK.

0.0	0.490203233802	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.498472294971	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.

0.0	0.50139485991	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.501633221323	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
1.0	0.498340042278	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.

0.0	0.498806039678	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.500014606419	The Syrians should stay in Syria.

0.0	0.495352472938	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.500127670551	That's right, three pages.

1.0	0.502778571749	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.494862360294	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.499385228573	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.490423404336	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.

0.0	0.499013001878	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.499003448655	But it is a general economic issue.

0.0	0.497412572114	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.499087368397	About Medicare?
0.0	0.490963343323	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.500746785528	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.498325077265	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.500725193004	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.476797885042	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.491817645268	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.499712848842	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.494954350265	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
1.0	0.503306400936	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.49993144016	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.499584637975	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.489416328626	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.498545551422	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.497756832193	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.499521237435	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
1.0	0.500149854261	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.500739546469	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.499954363377	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.497551210791	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.497704230076	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.500524310574	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.499039523025	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.499148392734	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.492547771556	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.492968713068	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.498083834144	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.498359729747	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.499680654207	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.499387237387	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.497580592438	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.502346664729	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.49769944	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.499680384349	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.499620406123	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.50084398855	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.498805513976	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.492581982423	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.500871497937	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.490587702894	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.500473201827	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.497239741418	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.502048167846	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.499199540393	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.500120043245	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.499954364468	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.498878197546	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.499605534439	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.500297191275	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.498220426307	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.499125931157	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.498418594113	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.498965003419	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.500818919865	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.501451198332	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.500827056821	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.49950114926	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.498907178999	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.49150607298	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.491877692447	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.509669307686	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.499987554249	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.498347978514	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.499648600292	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.50078428705	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.500398174132	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.49928230681	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.489422796614	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.500554438809	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.499636695128	And God bless America.
0.0	0.49892519954	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.500793920463	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.491390257817	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.497328419614	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.501267372735	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.499127539281	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.498343058586	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.499876755107	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.507112697212	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.500364347154	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.49879244991	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.490563625183	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.50048972375	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.506614900087	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.499736023713	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.499664467716	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.498551398647	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.499220650383	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
1.0	0.499904447079	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.499489024319	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.498915439858	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.49934921566	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.499599896928	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.499084842593	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.500374493082	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.503276349085	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.495051026829	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.500746051254	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.499973004559	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.49897016961	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.489066816261	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.500168488804	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.499388793519	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.496879133205	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.48990044207	Again...
0.0	0.498586439475	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
1.0	0.508477713881	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.502964567104	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.498022419005	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.500843267304	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.501794655006	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.498774033394	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.500672314158	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.500350462809	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.500933070987	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.499031185856	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.496954408352	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.499579993637	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.496711931535	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.500969285086	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.500166602932	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.501349501301	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.499735308378	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.501939489852	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
1.0	0.501334186532	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.499026040352	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.498417045561	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.498065655724	But look...
0.0	0.499003153483	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.499745706802	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.494084836568	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.497706194688	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.499100891737	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.499618123838	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.488154747574	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.497699759284	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.490264272813	Absolutely.
0.0	0.4999288304	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.498832989074	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.503958245536	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.499028292937	We do.
0.0	0.500209680651	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.500049409305	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.490264272813	Right.
0.0	0.499020139579	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.500832512351	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.499983468519	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.499343773478	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.499348797936	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.493915297023	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.493272180621	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.500856051167	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.499951873788	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.495344074643	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.502644762404	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.498945736806	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.502938958655	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.499678526655	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.501016144597	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.500611199496	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.499006429984	Thank you.
0.0	0.501066984643	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.496712439372	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.499534867865	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.502443374221	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.500541771534	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.496387068993	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.497914405358	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.500509806608	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.498817975825	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.498541248473	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.497854980177	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.50067118823	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.500114584292	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.500076953584	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.499414333319	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.49954859714	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.501405604874	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.502621310162	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.499285542431	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.490021010691	No.
0.0	0.499904293922	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.501022286039	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.501678688353	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.500829879555	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.498547313275	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.500874626637	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.503293573042	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.50182968995	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.499892700454	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.501004839539	I don't care.
0.0	0.502402157625	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.499678830328	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.500174802577	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
1.0	0.500442576087	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.490264272813	Right.

0.0	0.49972570741	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.500730659415	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.499315290279	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.492555404923	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.499200253901	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.49905078222	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.499775110606	You can't do nothing.
1.0	0.500465953128	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.510148664033	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.500823299083	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.504984735403	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.500712979488	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.498800754207	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.49914787609	What should we do?
0.0	0.500245061653	He has never defended...
0.0	0.499571116423	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.501632109599	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.499731617628	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.499117312735	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.499508822055	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.499176707143	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.499426942117	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.496564344927	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.499695342131	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.500232294653	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.498920668041	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.493603085596	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.498817695796	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
1.0	0.501348989358	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.501639404083	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.494946934792	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.502797667137	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.50796060185	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.498498231998	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.491220669856	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.498742987134	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
1.0	0.502555604547	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.499395966464	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.500510826276	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.498359596005	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.499621872693	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.499582898761	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.497117785998	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.499745776436	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.500387469168	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.49266213436	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.489853271459	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.49891718359	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.498412848633	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
1.0	0.502013385674	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.499579464232	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.50179574468	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.499219858799	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.500612985965	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.499805551682	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.498811347724	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.499227007886	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.498870558297	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.493283033778	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.498806039678	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.498899618415	But you know what?
0.0	0.501032342671	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.500858792155	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.487999129662	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.499644908532	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.500363155818	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.500325455967	Of course not.
0.0	0.490405963786	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.502416605974	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.498316194241	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.499240361458	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.500380851823	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.500372750621	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.500961040127	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.490999393859	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.501059984866	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.493068707606	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.49918799262	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.498250002696	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.49778313626	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.500639240109	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.499513723718	It's true.
0.0	0.50045479053	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.488860893697	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.499503351209	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.504170077684	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.499911555096	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.499831614123	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.499573724694	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.488811081143	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.509701681214	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.499263905459	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.506142268567	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.502556355073	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.489568561611	Maria...
0.0	0.498817478871	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.499558822563	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.498682685456	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.501208215827	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.498454439062	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.500097738334	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.50358290759	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.501824355458	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.491816036631	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.509249133912	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.499649021122	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.502065412808	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.500179569293	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.496636423025	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.500035523204	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.491675236715	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.50101566993	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.497925313561	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.508238544276	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.496532457467	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.501757943448	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.503466542911	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.498256152412	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.4980158887	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.499827539589	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.500327982995	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.499011065118	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.500080148521	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.500063779747	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.49664754184	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.498286917023	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.489632159322	...
0.0	0.499258455858	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.512078754958	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.499524548762	Wait for what?
0.0	0.500382866977	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.490264272813	Absolutely.
0.0	0.499783050158	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.501932425261	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.48332864378	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.499458208649	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.499434470682	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.501054058686	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.499862722891	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.499982707058	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.50216046509	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.501980813762	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.499018292224	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.497309016453	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.500975055016	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.500996252462	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.500419989377	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.49961482778	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.499112645961	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.499413309123	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.492342902247	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.499042888256	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.500941284083	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.499028292937	I do.
0.0	0.498013919769	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.499815979931	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.499514655253	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.498841100588	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.500941187696	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.498767506293	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.496287728931	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.498717080228	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.498996344724	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.498881409526	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.49743774437	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.498479363092	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.491421412597	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.500105199403	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.499545996951	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.491281444112	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.495297817314	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.49967460659	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.49739901647	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.499607243	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.495889723468	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.499930418958	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.488812732087	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.501019117065	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
1.0	0.501251858407	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.500244331422	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.500104060427	You really can't.
0.0	0.500312334398	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.501536587264	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.495989552128	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.499096205862	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.500768257569	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.501577238634	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.49866160766	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.500242343149	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
