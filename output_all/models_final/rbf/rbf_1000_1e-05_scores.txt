0.0	0.763607130563	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.210316827232	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.774202262612	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.209218268508	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.20149962502	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.20121394812	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.437716426864	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.308848020551	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.200757645321	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.200263008565	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.5	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.552267578368	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.300204089284	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.706187213362	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.300891956381	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.138726876449	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.356015860486	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.665958898954	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.603525642674	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.691981376312	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.410945675577	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.196426113004	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.914828043323	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.248929939853	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.256225995054	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.51176585367	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.608000992087	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.307510118862	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.148065106224	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.305417307454	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.43792510542	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.233342071108	No.
1.0	0.755505618839	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.321073338778	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.644918130694	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.802787953475	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.303793844451	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.75316787654	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.0692838298083	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.126087888404	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.363421328426	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.737723222155	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.207343762324	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.178491880213	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.276905402257	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.380975301139	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.999981162126	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.0489381413569	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.0994249667532	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.234983839713	You really can't.
0.0	0.759804086014	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.20503879754	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.240826559356	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.327877009455	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.286174111336	But here's the real key.
1.0	0.830358039882	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.415343998324	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.234771879679	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.247331665125	Divide that out.
0.0	0.983490782904	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.159779956969	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.342152556541	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.46839466812	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.140523459667	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.740164686786	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.5	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.292859428389	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.686234335486	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.434675855271	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.424252371399	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.230483626133	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.198034639772	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.129403136455	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.224280064442	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.5	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.319376109362	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.823406027916	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.238024523713	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.275801749313	In addition to that...
0.0	0.521594909837	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
1.0	0.399857976022	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.570335967831	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.664456521821	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.30586884904	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.697910414033	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.362719415127	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.158924163652	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.530554985328	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.183338312412	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.124188207203	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.567308682887	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
1.0	0.375992791254	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.18113830443	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.281080660916	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.214696111804	We're running.
0.0	0.513884846758	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.318051850917	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.241759726492	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.424342556897	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.247712172906	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.204550854289	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.480374234566	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.305902273785	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.279768845148	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.0930460301916	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.228805963034	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.207897598694	Yes.
0.0	0.229427422146	I can't do it.
0.0	0.420298789892	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.482327458684	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.43657904737	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.210026759774	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.266047328335	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.925021559089	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.275341126352	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.0907005444976	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.523881301147	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.177293687349	And God bless America.
0.0	0.142004266205	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.211236764987	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.797414981363	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.370176919979	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.232825216958	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.359934327079	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.160041501073	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.280745891222	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.916496481849	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.335198523297	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.772696929084	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.630103233848	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.28765170241	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.360211220405	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.53296212065	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.896843530058	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.978837325037	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.130123830439	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.692409046338	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.240637134073	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.242588112891	You do.
0.0	0.597734180689	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.5	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.387352508811	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.925674243611	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.623389000311	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.410982854724	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.554310023795	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.394895187649	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.52364482454	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.332726406185	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.19821434509	We have to obey the laws.
1.0	0.322239699859	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.175146894305	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.1034899436	And guess what?
0.0	0.918875366649	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.334619833429	We actually did it.
0.0	0.762387292737	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.293909360001	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.506282072831	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.19117187456	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.26415156736	It never happens.
0.0	0.935267760492	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
1.0	0.961495235746	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.355591461356	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.5	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.560583622565	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.444109131445	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.528070180366	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.214147578862	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.696370069344	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.347327354736	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.31714054658	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.180841465415	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.274539162579	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.163022290153	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.157286669324	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.215279063507	You know that.
0.0	0.275487621322	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.28523220033	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.546687053648	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.221333903952	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.985929191609	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.312233955848	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.765125684346	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.226961096955	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.185416298471	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.363349538836	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.26121147724	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.170775182641	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.296626447488	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.556357409589	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.181703365203	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.222657589458	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.353148994538	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.273169923126	That's not right.
0.0	0.232331576964	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.431569035823	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.285174288171	You get together.
0.0	0.254523685262	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.153732544545	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.56386079359	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.329230621789	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.543053494716	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.320806841557	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.488313090463	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.320575292265	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.42919460486	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.154490516487	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.333414466367	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.307541676165	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.350348731435	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.193247536708	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.218874414972	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.377649022269	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.282852415149	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.248537577372	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.0405301000144	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.155123305122	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.152892484753	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.142506965349	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.256309473666	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.21687092569	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.262857620612	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.880904709666	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.841994199683	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.267566800422	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.758733695597	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.0514081623005	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.600101631809	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.671070939132	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.302047659271	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.275259322272	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
1.0	0.336115118678	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.751879008585	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.313879855205	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.287491339346	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.943383784122	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
1.0	0.658775342388	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.128443464428	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.265125692405	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.680659302141	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.520276263605	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
1.0	0.920730530028	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.961227564369	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.157104188512	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.211913204637	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.314287246897	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.316408816968	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.570628562008	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.209378190212	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.295525137341	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.403060548909	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.254721445493	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.5	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.381778102398	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.697971180805	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
1.0	0.152842865912	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.429886036413	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.323094477538	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.405399758029	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.147967990327	How great is that?
0.0	0.90467540826	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.617564285638	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.237134562037	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.43324148447	He hit oil.
0.0	0.723413887305	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.432449719892	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.921772234668	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.269387458892	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.440634213238	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.180181935476	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.228834977149	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.419124613954	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.618249844646	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.250242118497	Right.
0.0	0.0611067260884	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.522763348294	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.257026301699	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.551276368812	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.376523874388	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.291425379372	This is 2016.
0.0	0.189494449741	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.0309276303056	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.664771889748	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.436014505191	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.292642334414	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.361632919471	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.74971000942	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.383566249649	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.378416314028	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.262528875805	She said the truth.
0.0	0.525979146436	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.289510187317	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.288103754493	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.182658093791	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.26865314574	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.350050518202	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.149351050734	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.386000236353	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.438303800984	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.200368072389	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.414294895026	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.457095557826	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.233670243361	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.244765272548	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.301920541843	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.24246989825	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.269267017465	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.169013386654	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.34911284499	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.27872246661	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.605157575334	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.288767833864	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.43597776498	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.658113815363	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.139268756589	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.761578614409	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.620495222842	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.126127832203	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.483722894893	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.494207527976	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.558421769118	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.207897598694	Yes.
0.0	0.221204859099	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.262223409297	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.263879150215	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.382858152485	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.33304756936	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.537035172876	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.22203215577	in particular.
0.0	0.48104919346	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.663624633326	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.181810945678	You know why?
0.0	0.415211588522	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.31482996838	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.262209432697	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.164459273419	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.359171462045	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.252020049734	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.208435938023	That's for sure.
0.0	0.357828907291	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.073759187468	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.184607259425	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.65209315199	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.376217292494	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.129148815025	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.783699543712	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.233342071108	No.
0.0	0.316880835631	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.463346852603	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.269940003972	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.284587403143	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.392919004438	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.664300267693	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.593679180741	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.599315948055	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.230116488346	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.463029084357	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.173721310186	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.470187894408	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.216827638076	Think about that.
0.0	0.943095400803	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
1.0	0.804034104305	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.346329603844	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.320559452915	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.422524720169	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.233342071108	No.
0.0	0.345995325552	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.180780054505	And you know what?
0.0	0.959676427572	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.665947253928	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.253603374325	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.472980671021	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.34501244574	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.586019259724	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.46905073279	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.314948211216	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.199337359317	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.460719171569	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.271013369569	Creativity.
0.0	0.53940603431	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.389965754926	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.508423569399	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.230063732289	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.552255741631	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.353333599277	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.152523372563	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.389923101715	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.316915039481	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.420433667547	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.168655222629	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.515097472808	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.935412909384	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.27049916851	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.630998907538	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.460854538168	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.221126950844	I'm aware of that.
1.0	0.935693007753	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.372654975995	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.313344801018	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.377335251122	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.372409772731	I didn't find it offensive at all.
1.0	0.694817259209	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.403196675348	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.409079153443	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.199653753366	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.349691425102	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.19842431335	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.358609659253	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.238936702382	Check it out.
0.0	0.232726751076	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.271984653301	Came out great.
0.0	0.319548586809	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.724840164323	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.342673750078	That never works.
0.0	0.171786733475	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.168729554275	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.468534274449	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.265360363149	About Medicare?
0.0	0.354181837375	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.390806161466	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.238294796371	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.128199139715	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.0603427005305	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.162104975183	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.0881772610881	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.311307092785	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.50752208243	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.0954405449935	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.56240791787	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.161860712934	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.336785572619	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.241414431054	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.444548367297	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.57819615499	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.602463666428	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.607388353336	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.264785055398	Our next president...
0.0	0.478662865942	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.566794839337	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.367839125678	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.843965336571	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.286871337866	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.348502988024	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.461219479372	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.345315211627	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.172872878011	Why is that?
0.0	0.276655419566	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.857216627571	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.700458288676	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.964464806537	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.647208838281	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
1.0	0.820936506621	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.237684776214	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.46359585729	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.571369417807	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.365270776189	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.211915147909	I don't care.
0.0	0.317212426497	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.117762059439	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.208263991093	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.6021205265	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.53872882942	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.365460305547	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.32164981041	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.546254294583	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.239194537485	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.123595112275	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.95509866956	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.417152924455	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.305162252389	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.377946051109	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.750532442695	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.33162513772	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.0801616565769	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.274075185822	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.399481923423	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.283702301754	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.754430196105	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.256614768851	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.354983748119	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.933877745823	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.781622308098	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.693796356673	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.459714553197	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
1.0	0.650027584489	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.104672510978	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.159644694862	How do I know this?
0.0	0.15246933639	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.488707868497	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.222873178933	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.384565255213	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.485677939501	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.556564339673	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.145847549391	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.14974715149	I understand.
0.0	0.113123520384	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.616392094219	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.233342071108	No.
1.0	0.361466450983	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.273579603047	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.473557570526	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.263921955896	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.709902362776	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.120637016395	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.9691827748	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.457506132172	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.243994660645	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.279130123355	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.940418968704	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.815179668388	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.154047496378	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.236156292684	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.31472492143	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
1.0	0.902269503461	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.360553854714	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.270031284393	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.384591696616	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.799656397073	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.294397624586	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.306363837236	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.448600237284	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.157858406903	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.801841260819	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.191967557263	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.223529465726	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.077838928984	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.5	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.640513943035	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.563199945136	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.338071653839	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.505431996238	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.514473479854	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.360159281503	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.163425424762	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.258300958965	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.553158890223	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.487376720835	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.285506855266	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.21366214792	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.905605829454	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.355798081908	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.373409206429	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.163363886489	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.507313332372	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.511432399412	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.0926237185009	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.396344259106	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.524387537761	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.192192274041	Well, sure.
0.0	0.538983457863	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.802602133083	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.531953540923	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.598542597968	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.074861765452	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.620848164109	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.205631190767	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.66486350913	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.167932576646	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.308595508816	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.19268102242	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.304471223335	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.443682773605	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.780101714861	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.248509022568	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.320489859443	I got that.
0.0	0.12943044603	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.21686629781	It's a joke.
0.0	0.254130740459	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.316883315899	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.549118821403	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.241726463579	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.329612819598	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.264672065667	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.156827239701	I like that.
0.0	0.784204068529	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.149312375111	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.205474651791	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.603446853967	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.589951374111	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.923592459072	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.624191869725	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.46749438476	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.239823492948	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.89633494772	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.5	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.255624538252	Not bad.
0.0	0.60223935121	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.841914941883	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.641096570013	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.555801252459	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.786955579505	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.174006466958	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.374827338978	They're sick of politics as usual.
1.0	0.608375927453	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.885905902683	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.250759960396	You don't have to.
0.0	0.907027511373	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.212683870408	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.270040785307	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.416444814222	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.489573865393	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
1.0	0.552194046717	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.463512625435	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.365526105799	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.961412263054	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.296690340684	You know why three?
0.0	0.365194843681	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.213536735363	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.379886856719	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.23631627477	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.206021093838	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.581045898569	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.457187608733	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.414595841888	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.775281316571	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.207897598694	Yes.
0.0	0.613531166523	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.327442663926	It was.
0.0	0.106575161935	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.360894477936	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.366614721843	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.759665960011	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.245922707737	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.202954795909	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.766000479231	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.304782375956	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.0552832042294	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.306998757896	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.104700777494	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.308337149228	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.288182637485	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.380357969028	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.255444483963	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.158566712815	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.477270270058	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.198745285961	I'll say this.
0.0	0.931269648341	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.231393799364	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.467794236971	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.468269765292	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.399027768717	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.210003627293	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.0635871418376	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.282104125858	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.93175907498	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.0551172994615	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.169906333585	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.465408621187	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.541524168245	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.349037529753	But I was born here.
0.0	0.473607908047	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.369681244719	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.265145995185	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.639397005841	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.348738143557	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.615904436033	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.426013480213	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.0395153549427	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.156700860978	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.289948205819	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.223711877751	It is.
0.0	0.839635105577	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.924846153826	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.346919792707	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.527939682922	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.872427228839	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.258238741588	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.391055894	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.308699996145	We were wrong.
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.0797894984242	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.284544122642	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.539649583292	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.363887213441	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.393479211946	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.199675770444	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.700934378978	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.241880060089	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.229427422146	We can't do it.
0.0	0.186313450922	I think he is right.
0.0	0.139676567894	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.178603753079	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.0305935950863	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.717042442543	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.0371553423818	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.234476106484	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.593563582288	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.17830151804	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.280438016015	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
1.0	0.933273877675	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.23357375645	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.190929623165	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.210336880157	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.772298661553	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.394462729357	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.439444020627	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.332260751248	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.158486299871	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.307401204514	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.175185980849	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.180780054505	But you know what?
0.0	0.158401516404	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
1.0	0.32189554086	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.69883382359	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.298565125334	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.145657623665	It's true.
0.0	0.22874067537	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.44066825905	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.161873436132	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.208790233399	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.345828901873	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.768541152666	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.574463652043	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.75913454502	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.468811574819	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.192463581526	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.335368922336	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.564979004334	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.207007615772	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.203396981571	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.592157196205	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.250273230704	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.243557665892	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.166678332627	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.198071005177	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.0993962843904	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.251287117443	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.322438549701	He is a good man.
0.0	0.295056162116	That has not been...
0.0	0.270263275162	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.420928700058	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.638347102305	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.386824142124	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.52176680721	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.229254075716	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.468819672602	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.523940962592	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.669703627005	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.365006841484	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.170443641751	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.548072287964	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.188972388781	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.983148262446	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.248146949523	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.205543588745	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.393832518747	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.517674774571	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.85638518938	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.5	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.717641648379	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.475221017727	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.277331273772	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.214235264296	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.178245789587	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.472952784837	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.529132840975	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.25051567793	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.647625476455	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.410876662153	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.489033323364	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.0837808984225	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.384905283803	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.577898015338	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.5	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.647633657167	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.473437990408	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.37229114702	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.479694254835	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.436697302562	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.838581793952	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.760504577737	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.232586160447	That will change everything.
0.0	0.506942516976	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.108111377689	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.0710508227844	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.16101860071	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.213602656486	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.424015620654	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.376040111822	I never said that.
0.0	0.47376311127	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.

0.0	0.438584380946	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.813074856819	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.229829232333	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.34506227702	That's fine.
0.0	0.42380517846	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.330083918714	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.

0.0	0.204726759924	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.0887748262234	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.367679725385	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.

0.0	0.345423577221	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.338454307967	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.85893136222	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.

0.0	0.57488151467	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.22342658464	You find me...
0.0	0.5	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.357527916464	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.465447621922	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.484642380935	That's 13,000 miles.

0.0	0.147560600843	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.256554911671	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.354864296959	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.302156070581	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.312716632033	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.343719651309	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.387488032575	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.475642460892	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.85982725463	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.553342018	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.413704979685	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.613299733804	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.665596259235	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.759447437158	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.571508774681	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.242588112891	I do.
0.0	0.616920468075	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.296264474559	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.0964096094044	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.108366734126	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.797886472221	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.233111780045	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.301698439484	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.784581461993	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.63241397202	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.842546017486	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.476128909775	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.213208893387	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.568326380239	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.29255962258	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.302776126602	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.604314018562	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.372351498022	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.793492037315	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.523100076664	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.380402061657	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.22437725635	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.166215923233	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.392408404699	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.370574890282	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.3661895593	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.245902126676	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.258833893433	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.269261385136	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.248286077767	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.354619767873	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.148110266083	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.265124768498	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.392352605455	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.102162270373	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.60100245887	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.205849720159	That is...
0.0	0.28432654968	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.141950312583	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.220768900215	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.0912145117423	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.377710520582	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.11318175225	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.259248062982	We're not doing it.
1.0	0.5	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.682005430939	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.793528880607	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.342977537835	Good at email.
0.0	0.401235327886	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.86381839859	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.532019214279	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.360474538944	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.486162487214	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.143688810782	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.365039303445	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.218042397252	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.179388283089	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.938444712856	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.255684252279	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.395251319963	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.241256830866	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.031221908666	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.262232457046	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.192768337256	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.209198345532	Think about it.
0.0	0.233342071108	No.
0.0	0.216932937088	...
0.0	0.484553284526	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.388250282791	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.37011915413	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.346659198871	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.345812370398	He got lucky with fracking.
1.0	0.915710490573	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.480956024319	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.336181880138	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.38896631325	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.41472654158	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.382444451989	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.904408169654	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.194606718517	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.200930404745	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.317706414642	I know every one.
0.0	0.329209211962	That's the difference.
0.0	0.970029840639	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.563374438925	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.180780054505	And you know what?
0.0	0.219060775043	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.3395882007	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.188753995186	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.299334041989	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.883920981092	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.172456516351	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.646463252205	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.188293716292	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.20164985987	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.740711840299	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.15576538414	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.988068035714	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.84495997916	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.310451425274	I've done it.
0.0	0.684491716062	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.549787334276	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.139092128769	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.385426266998	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.305024706697	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.703866347671	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.366155894943	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.237153572094	You bet they do.
0.0	0.215594400763	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.36853463425	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.522569155439	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.678885364546	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.299218918644	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.70764910616	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
1.0	0.515225716936	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.252473525555	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.404032088266	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.288707245998	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.735213491149	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.411800805012	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.34949200798	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.438283557249	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.567873445297	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.246698536326	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.221627783293	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.0555294286004	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.271643309794	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.382598224669	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.374074814266	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.0978449637722	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.494003467314	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.18281366512	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.96612108707	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.765125684346	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
1.0	0.66196256741	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.128603845035	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.385790478232	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.0910400572554	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.189305286965	I want security.
0.0	0.415256659943	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.316043551941	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.419249860574	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.159429642027	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.381115673461	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.

0.0	0.374007271856	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.286886765081	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.268570993239	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.771494097155	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.305799084244	And the last piece is this.

0.0	0.359279701331	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.451238679939	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?

0.0	0.425557183037	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.866162030321	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.219298630875	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.341885158371	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.

0.0	0.220192052828	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.392563981687	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.894511882804	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.544151828275	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.

0.0	0.366102391171	I changed that.
0.0	0.489177415167	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.358281214757	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.488301238207	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.300635847321	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.287749368822	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.

0.0	0.340854968759	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.419231971354	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.368173218016	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.347330916009	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.233342071108	No.
0.0	0.477615967168	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.680905303017	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.

0.0	0.171078036449	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.4242691394	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.433024819358	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.912317405049	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.196197263985	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.137360155129	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.516854091498	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.229146993253	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.319600992387	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.306347285146	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.22874067537	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.164270794051	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.27813109444	That's not true.
0.0	0.298275695809	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.235938402317	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.0831498037493	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.0151634087657	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.538596497265	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.231633094445	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.193025695061	I love China.
0.0	0.445881454211	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.182977418177	He undermines it.
0.0	0.272945873074	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.133839294782	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.484012844547	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.234847750826	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.234796774182	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.223595990687	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.152527791617	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.319687629444	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.601019976959	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.294553799003	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.23179331267	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.312052142112	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.717472446314	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.701176213875	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.264875783193	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.307508245446	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.318276112451	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.257533891292	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.222839141939	So...
0.0	0.710530039283	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.432087096485	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.332714112094	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.458445654344	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.5	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.5	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.33354824614	I have no idea.
0.0	0.241541880127	We don't win.
0.0	0.474137112857	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.391552129874	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.201070790399	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.352476826188	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.828760910619	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.682231045989	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.394594635646	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.605004682839	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.607301240106	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.450007829199	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.435962344654	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.131501189507	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.182489452617	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.399912535802	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.742170604083	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.204894339838	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.416444814222	It's driving up stock prices.
1.0	0.308585263436	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.641579603822	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
1.0	0.577588675242	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.376414099024	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.345833833937	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.31661173805	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.306592866179	Do we still have standards?
1.0	0.296555155206	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.21368795494	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.928973935868	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.296310848443	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.105229951254	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.476592923545	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.337448262438	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.881664641122	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.242521056803	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
1.0	0.563145934194	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.206098419677	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.829308393996	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.0781435038145	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.138246254083	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.880985227734	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
1.0	0.974157581438	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.298958794357	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.364288193074	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.117495050333	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.538200247791	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
1.0	0.681060000939	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.18830063419	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.262117540051	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.70749710205	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.227478771851	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.337593508628	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.223268645482	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.363480792361	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.43574531845	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.184069276405	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.546986742759	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.607959907549	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.275747118093	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.964886231002	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.0624358338552	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.745298394098	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.258200897288	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.778745591421	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.737285040077	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.112847715143	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.117147467295	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.534814434525	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.444291189605	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.302138210023	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.27125644231	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.289962623925	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.291140048999	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.5	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.761572221034	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
1.0	0.742989281824	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.298525243038	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.286521272043	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.435309719195	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.975879974325	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.363516257656	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.295126270502	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.36905903376	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.45477901393	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0964019895985	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.256702313424	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.427348354895	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.301132212875	My background is different.
0.0	0.288404510696	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.164425367137	I would change them.
0.0	0.39569164435	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.647030525841	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.83646899796	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.390965316711	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
1.0	0.905674448565	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.191555532594	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.552916524486	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.547682883816	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.

0.0	0.231472633958	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.332260751248	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.642404115357	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.232402363846	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.525011180469	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.215174733477	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.761853847549	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.293036202518	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
1.0	0.755724124161	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.318222234365	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.415511532908	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.304041051314	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.90666966394	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.301521463439	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.368842246538	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.35836906212	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
1.0	0.18026441243	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.550080346176	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.491641517777	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.307608528045	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.198699097962	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.

0.0	0.209198345532	Think about it.
0.0	0.297228623736	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.184415934866	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.486861299229	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.362007477277	Now, you've got Europe.

0.0	0.471929673861	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.265653672929	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.40705785165	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.

0.0	0.417437239469	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.196901200744	(inaudible).
0.0	0.580922423712	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.207897598694	OK?
0.0	0.591721121189	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.760304662178	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.2709042077	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.29175415897	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.773958863226	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.180677907048	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.319682369681	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.629532140102	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.826391376828	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.641001520387	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.205874088709	I can do that.
0.0	0.289552032117	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.513593474776	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.328019185314	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.3446987466	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.102655345218	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.336293292793	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.140428302226	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.200758957416	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.907690053345	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.894870500614	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.456674055404	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.201891970021	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.283440412688	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.221238348758	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.44842076393	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.0894184919963	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
1.0	0.597406504986	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.335507667883	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.350469685071	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.674789709951	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.618648880623	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.204923449229	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.176944852026	I would change them.
0.0	0.294219400298	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.411013445847	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
1.0	0.91332739134	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.149580355935	I think you're --
0.0	0.412464701391	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.31508320601	It's not that complicated actually.
1.0	0.816186763125	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.573067745194	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.573155552755	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.589052202063	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
1.0	0.908650058437	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.334867796216	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.531605325661	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.16183709651	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.534238108657	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.606487699775	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.30791282951	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.981285527515	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.254673153182	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.202061706339	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.427854875974	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.484466360942	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.988951581974	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.315165562544	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.345689380443	Folks, we've got to wake up.
1.0	0.94912803779	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.138716111927	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.33238649166	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.230843383983	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.362799873395	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.220332281313	OK, good.
0.0	0.261369726481	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.339941019132	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.408942423201	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.277949315229	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.466556118784	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.898281709416	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.0431761143311	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.205306942763	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.227580022056	So you know what?
0.0	0.199578828512	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.397751091555	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.5	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.253027773714	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.0633443272181	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.562889322696	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.48988079814	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.356816278869	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.588738980454	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.141666652812	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.119372746459	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.462948065696	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.241451006377	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.264141941563	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.516856024887	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
1.0	0.9892993711	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.378625941083	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.242588112891	We do.
0.0	0.45982030464	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.260707439111	It's their money.
0.0	0.180780054505	And you know what?
0.0	0.0966913030805	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.350425262084	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.699775325532	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.424844333017	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.421405967954	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.213418055274	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.095290081407	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.125064970104	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.5	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.675970152375	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.521172577436	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.26855198166	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.0320147218439	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.657345661815	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.2044932519	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.961742828329	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.107629028996	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.295979562105	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.28919324464	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.114364413679	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.250424717275	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.5	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.424858354681	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.758598539888	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.164897134159	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.0483490319368	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.319931235871	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.740564365222	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.352271039506	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.414602445182	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.424303573583	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.132365001403	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.478851388082	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.260833011802	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.203166127826	...Chris...
0.0	0.244867919864	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.330174883335	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.505324460416	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.407278549953	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.312947487976	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.644962503357	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.417940948206	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.657964069359	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.234931589619	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.182781470909	And our economy was growing like crazy.
1.0	0.70996315772	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.245948621375	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.296307006368	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.142561786186	No, it's true.
0.0	0.490973553834	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.0584019327196	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.5	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.491878994551	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.557877048216	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.223591264687	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.287661368878	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.145289338719	And...
0.0	0.350431238571	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.693450444825	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.641078258378	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.23818170951	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.151397835995	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.544558732344	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.27323021208	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.296133502191	White people?
0.0	0.187117581837	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.0583864279956	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.0872977801948	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0950394220599	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.461869331349	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.350194738805	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.364814368457	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.449115000345	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.280573494484	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.216932937088	...
0.0	0.534367820296	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.599446641128	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.364931799259	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.34897984359	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...

0.0	0.0883080613892	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.414737755533	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.588639422018	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.

0.0	0.276763069618	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.416570533502	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.939117023048	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.368617210979	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.617041718929	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.377399883072	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.769117271749	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.250328309724	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.269860095323	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.247643919105	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.162685623914	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.179648729118	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.315817112422	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.246477633066	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.291249103191	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.56398591705	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.571574255595	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.065450287835	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.817250974337	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.146103043209	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.426083148068	He was on the board.
0.0	0.153210580182	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.361941890601	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.277085154988	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.75965274749	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.9192985555	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.717008563184	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.183377366124	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.232018328052	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.363708110217	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.118147580749	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.307428113783	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.197978677885	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.403661808274	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.203095656895	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.273169923126	That's not right.
0.0	0.539891941855	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.285174288171	You're right.
0.0	0.574925454224	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.229694561561	No, no.
0.0	0.837479076947	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.

0.0	0.29976408542	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.745035249297	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.188210890608	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.465912069588	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.341761884212	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.015825803447	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.399227044456	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.149532079381	But I would add this.
0.0	0.179672795007	This will end.
0.0	0.649051975119	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.781255681649	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.293747575306	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.280536704037	That's right.
0.0	0.746051241204	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.838244292227	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.225219600058	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.535152462825	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.856474342706	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.973950461706	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.422877938022	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.364838831685	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.696929696626	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.417414381178	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.200316168785	And so do I.
0.0	0.0520113262517	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.281949789366	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.175459974169	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.181764595115	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.763009263272	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.755094601415	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.178754345944	...Thank you.
0.0	0.207168187516	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.413860014283	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.888846421026	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.423103035595	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.187084299785	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.225646071398	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
1.0	0.312160806884	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.26636377305	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.214600972206	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.138783663952	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.210091935487	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.195664206818	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.275737720162	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.0747433819669	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.186172564954	That's my view.
0.0	0.332144280101	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.97233808104	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
1.0	0.75473964174	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.674828933098	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.69868490276	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.353875122068	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.723046326524	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.270803221382	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.631817061267	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.30394949288	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.141967475719	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.137854655603	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.548336126156	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.251804460731	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.381315769081	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.249276052534	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.62656014899	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.597696178208	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.367146575344	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.689813462195	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.374028276922	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.345356090785	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.721219089146	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.396737995794	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.352319970827	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.471750597012	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
1.0	0.577745857747	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.547125197559	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.330152868223	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.83951342364	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.28750058679	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.377034439943	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.397467979601	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.714010995123	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.31517087394	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.696304852518	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.158416068871	What should we do?
0.0	0.580976082181	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.289018696827	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.378714552236	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.214057396015	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.279794869583	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.252302188348	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.207897598694	OK.
0.0	0.457849093102	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.208359742985	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.156013995417	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.368320934167	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.219809959312	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.846825209273	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.471905394218	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.207897598694	OK?
0.0	0.273953467089	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.242902767917	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.355893319362	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.193029446502	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.35564701845	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.245162704295	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.37128867144	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.423001292106	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.284013164452	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.767513563061	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.286077183208	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.384885183439	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.174241294169	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.483792525325	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.180780054505	And you know what?
0.0	0.35207095783	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.376040111822	I never said that.
0.0	0.454805117528	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.550393099594	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.361612051364	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.22848813485	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.398054521494	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.0208859804085	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.226593172034	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.251040624612	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.890060667156	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.323205603508	A brief response.
0.0	0.584973283418	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.571147516864	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.333994196862	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.67902543985	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.351004117153	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.51119817749	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.155706115355	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.771576549809	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.796109854903	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.279975196518	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.5	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.339643978615	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.232216443095	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.543962390483	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.376572225627	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.105610408473	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.515289834817	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.218511292784	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.16808974588	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.187604989429	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.307703627357	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.105037184513	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.0788477732787	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.416811456319	I was not at all.
0.0	0.299047065675	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.256089668698	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.545432253954	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.209078169998	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.213124669185	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.113832830664	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.682643327206	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.453643984808	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.344093875999	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.395501767078	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.261910331129	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.461499704857	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.313442137533	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.574112066249	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.208707423503	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.103122940216	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.126529385238	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.156977280392	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.0395094941598	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.291101376789	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.706116281195	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.423599378479	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.371375525868	I said no.
0.0	0.863847285143	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.837946744021	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.679267928564	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.764346975053	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.446188791134	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.44486634059	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.387233647964	The world has changed.
0.0	0.273105661932	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.416618572293	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.22660426462	I promise.
0.0	0.318554822214	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.651098852362	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.532332336271	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.217547257957	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.257477370202	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.60860421843	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.549031826758	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.741737722499	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.260507551113	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.0831569306465	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.23463283396	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.414757650244	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.328433973015	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.271555826503	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.5	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.229652527078	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.460323913094	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.263804354118	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.215997704918	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
1.0	0.796691435664	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.472135212757	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.284685079213	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.25791680424	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.229454451036	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.642719688727	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.932038159607	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.310275988541	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.5	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.448159513208	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.785794201621	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.674752248069	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.185414790065	We don't need that.
0.0	0.352607757104	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.165620101129	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.721271538471	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.321437355474	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.243357408951	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.0164175489259	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.549898834557	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.479574255635	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.119289282334	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.308979849572	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.105732810732	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.167284159688	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.464500188068	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.0627879964405	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.5	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.988734515552	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.455969760128	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.562295084393	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.662924079248	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.239027778051	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.359754403148	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.552993755793	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.26009050379	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.588851295579	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.512789578136	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.646511273936	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.572879286001	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.0733600128398	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.0574122476609	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.278629609423	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.18685810264	See?
0.0	0.176594116902	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.391948016765	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.182774262276	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.559127076343	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.817556064055	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.146987167372	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.747588501287	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.224372234797	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.126209112327	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.232478473255	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.377825489241	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.41263230149	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.510126223283	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.372628649426	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.319519805889	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
1.0	0.626270234216	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.662518558477	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.163764216947	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.542677358713	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.530991666118	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.26487456159	You do the arithmetic.
1.0	0.214933527564	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.460943500118	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.359819409954	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.394114630718	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.445978499601	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.106044216233	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.189972096701	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.888111111966	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.781270647772	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.298466277736	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.391478756619	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.279405806341	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.459777421652	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.397149610277	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.248440332972	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.219385909982	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.360253664823	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.330024235606	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.431178682839	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.526718513688	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.0595861050948	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.608522667537	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.236470259791	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.513304644449	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.251834615213	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.896726423301	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.315637702592	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.225095729455	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.45274818032	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.729827540245	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.436611655937	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.358300488533	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.5	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.286211504044	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.348406304679	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.490440148613	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.091933307624	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.176564294045	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.615302600553	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.203166127826	...John...
0.0	0.0397420803249	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.195698102291	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.416104795725	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.366175787322	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.320711352193	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.224084823413	We need security.
0.0	0.116011772834	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
1.0	0.858747309415	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.172735445699	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.271600608828	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.374420357795	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.145718525152	And here's why.
0.0	0.311341536318	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.209364139223	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.363628989677	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.82693453616	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.386295664172	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.371515885224	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.451981169947	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.651713621187	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.484779401343	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.614767094524	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.178118372546	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.724487544142	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.427564330993	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.207846736356	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.376678209532	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.149880234049	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.257960826508	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.351859491835	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.340253716587	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.178198803386	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.483606807397	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.123218417919	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.317998863493	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.840132830505	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.

0.0	0.165942301618	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.516662850296	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.266104471207	Hey look, he never had a chance.

0.0	0.714714768571	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.

0.0	0.614233028132	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.291888645956	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.202124249598	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.207085923356	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.591310115783	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.422851673065	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.174338646027	...No, sir...

0.0	0.396536982415	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.227554933025	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.535729512322	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.457008371158	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).

0.0	0.755732730546	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.478122533822	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.349083241461	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.518502541405	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.316424766195	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.711848785069	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?

0.0	0.30996550467	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.361472834871	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.242711606467	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.329230336383	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.526115955813	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.641736663064	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.342252392004	Well, I did.
0.0	0.21664142776	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.745400857061	You know, I won two record elections.

0.0	0.525034245774	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.142176331073	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.269495452359	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.203783116648	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.323142920861	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.573372343617	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.650145244222	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.227572070032	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.219961425147	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.822267107177	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.0925790992311	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.420437220456	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
1.0	0.24326445424	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.37351623711	That is our government today.
0.0	0.205737092459	No -- no...
0.0	0.69488094488	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.252282068077	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.203447442232	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.360113266207	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.153328314972	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.933806431658	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.514626335465	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.763844350016	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.282437188836	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.413447161123	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.225487617229	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.185063015552	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.649036399869	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.466646397388	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
1.0	0.59554027424	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.0417728813275	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.329045979143	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.177534039253	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.304687651427	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.236064081919	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.246227523995	Let's talk about our campaigns.
1.0	0.895762884099	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.348544648195	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.564786112495	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.700100020654	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.335406439256	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.227639270331	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.513431518371	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.346951161607	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.351839702158	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.733909695334	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.197823550068	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.207277014797	These...
0.0	0.363941420844	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.494835817981	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.796240523806	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.233342071108	No.
0.0	0.102041218171	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.210506117872	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.668821274511	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.309796199354	I've laid out...
0.0	0.587177771707	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.298162408279	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.389838283861	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.259762366351	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.190928983658	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.335228779156	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.351903951659	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.334714602185	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.188898080909	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.298385321793	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.338412284103	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.177641236143	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.267648964086	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.296041020742	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.337070156514	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.481265142792	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.254259743115	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.260370690627	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.346098035377	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.394186942757	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.682339982937	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.512942811179	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.35645292531	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.64829894291	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.816285867684	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.792835108908	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.250242118497	Absolutely.
0.0	0.184706716168	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.448581316037	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.264583499214	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.228625381567	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.220318152035	That's why I ask for your support for president.
1.0	0.488180318121	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.468580811599	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.252508907759	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.709891211062	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.0875235596595	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.793144248094	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.290485587994	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.270545438653	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.209986638074	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.410269164121	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.487628925269	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.298978375807	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.0613164006221	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.194476508226	We need sound money.
0.0	0.222939250365	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.273215590735	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.403375822881	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.151695351898	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.277323142873	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.480428138625	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.110968708551	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.379749872496	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.250392129101	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.244190101408	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.385160294779	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.203127254324	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.274283476518	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.351753268422	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.481056879445	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.312160806792	...income tax...
0.0	0.256440682409	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
1.0	0.131856318908	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.391194395236	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.395887742775	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.30241148317	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.783178542112	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.164897134159	But if you look at working men and women.
1.0	0.691841482112	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.15844154699	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.259248062982	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.277044912224	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.401486346412	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.106175488935	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.292515566393	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.310400771205	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.386285249266	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.5	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.118288657826	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.79311781763	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.566367329005	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.162429220466	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.289130457017	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.0597021499793	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.161587762347	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.450387122108	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.786543973446	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.131019348381	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.453016929812	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.

0.0	0.0450519515527	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.614912120672	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.180780054505	And you know what?
0.0	0.420175018585	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.824669408196	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.65243959043	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.506257412353	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.428828118082	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.667907918442	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.284760719795	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.149105701344	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.207897598694	Yeah.
0.0	0.525113190639	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.542298126356	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.249332101117	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.517491062623	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.420317628479	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.224186615558	He's wrong.
0.0	0.381092148515	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.0771164116106	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.308051849916	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.415631062643	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.27326528956	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.136540403632	And why?
0.0	0.764095571682	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.297700762894	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.378609212709	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.488954400645	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.0576944298742	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.32198848734	They're a scam.
0.0	0.594638732872	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.735616620811	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.112296115652	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.467721478514	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.203497215352	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.343027787413	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.250242118497	Right.
0.0	0.193036232974	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.189782996043	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.662391341009	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.418326059037	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.179554250687	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.533994578372	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.352368430507	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.455549541198	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.364473620133	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.186434641312	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.300651339885	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.519345981293	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.636849161368	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.302729345975	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.151114006587	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.820936506621	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.305530868686	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
1.0	0.713632562345	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.207867361396	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.118453309618	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.658602429342	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
1.0	0.815102662379	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.408955253564	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.253732253382	John?
0.0	0.657254538706	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.14907088059	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.298354909275	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.239966210636	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.219515334497	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.386831835749	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.170113834702	But look...
0.0	0.315445006155	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.602501422189	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.213413688355	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.332691452448	You're simply not.
0.0	0.300989054663	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.356594454444	That's what I said.
0.0	0.234319723067	That's what he is.
0.0	0.239494947681	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.264114154693	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.332203790558	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.367587403996	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.905896488491	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.813502005016	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.511786023825	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.58728971597	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.519674872559	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.261709008416	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.308464504014	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.198745285961	I will do that.
0.0	0.269952329344	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.651957274589	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.578302642946	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.151643555387	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.353975095742	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.690895472477	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.463017943014	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.205414374841	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.248087056273	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.361045419163	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.805196117095	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.341917091633	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.275222297217	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.173624890797	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.560032729996	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.881720842019	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.619289017953	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.215722610334	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.0493103206402	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.59606745325	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.223632891071	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.248881580303	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.117615996203	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.253732253382	Alright.
0.0	0.38458690352	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.216932937088	...
0.0	0.249388037122	No their not.
0.0	0.0917641580646	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.733356205679	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.290815901978	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.377448583692	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.417868061089	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.145002423973	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.295462139541	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.534674126882	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.415144312839	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.223720069784	Illegal.
0.0	0.31500974535	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.306372500299	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.589385831713	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.234789570134	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.171499692295	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.337924901416	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.696816626983	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.548412815987	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.319127392926	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
1.0	0.889810787212	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.417589966387	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.573492014629	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.452089133206	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.215788908378	I have...
0.0	0.646907794981	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.175580564859	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.542978669384	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.348339551745	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.810095528212	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.332114883811	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.682882738331	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.216671383598	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.10282617425	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.104324756059	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.820938501297	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.337970938626	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.19265826343	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.238969539452	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.1065207772	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.35429694006	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.400802115939	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.265267188934	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.952379350609	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.506967546956	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.0860850288551	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.356387612723	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.744555871005	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.187252122025	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.297743680793	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.471277787741	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.

0.0	0.686205680628	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.537561880556	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.163909410998	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.491377444752	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.308916090159	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.267826829685	Are you serious about this election?

0.0	0.619280212857	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.461890065215	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.

0.0	0.64560030371	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.122741631401	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.0865710378622	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.

0.0	0.259958619765	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.219645757635	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.428950427131	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.239507018198	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.224132118574	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.660188597267	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.191823156721	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.372397838746	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.316635730441	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.

0.0	0.87533136231	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.393768922288	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.328767721182	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.330211981241	No vision at all.

0.0	0.133771415939	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.688071477508	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.891510559386	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.264090058928	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.168230427422	I agree with them.
0.0	0.203946636578	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.254743502781	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.141147608125	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.185414790065	I don't like that.
0.0	0.979249674986	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.62866258794	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.572205327081	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.367726788022	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.416159463368	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.22858583457	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.290211748618	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.60389877921	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.245996121505	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.0653980509519	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.0344467431887	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.397471229256	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.530832919697	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.409617412855	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.28623425724	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.254731297967	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.171602512304	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.1398508981	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.200816223088	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.335571217183	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.485279447929	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.677156889033	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.207897598694	Okay.
0.0	0.315013389264	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.206152277115	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.207048540631	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.9906153591	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.250467611895	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.806275537082	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.489626185845	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.483828093513	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.643786179904	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.211001117474	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.65321866651	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.52368653726	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.853682530938	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.643560756494	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.808182727026	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.323520701552	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.402198699488	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.350799767288	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.161088287627	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.53080509723	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.937273525317	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
1.0	0.598939605059	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.259581381981	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.506223605696	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.27713813952	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.448636073032	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.464546631045	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.322736430068	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
1.0	0.949478060883	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.519102815854	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.627791083428	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
1.0	0.528472560921	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.203166127826	...Chris...
0.0	0.295189713081	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.822445786192	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.585699216754	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
1.0	0.373107728092	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.110645857219	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.656021807486	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.608696127726	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.236297111119	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.374450896853	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.648575245586	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.892616977799	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.16414059098	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.473970227729	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.126333204786	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.564424414732	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.404160872029	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.412526021097	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.205868689696	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.269959971052	I want security for this country.
1.0	0.945963946836	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.531265120284	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.331933326039	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.216234885998	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.309460330522	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.410289114586	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.173057768519	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
1.0	0.556080733185	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
1.0	0.536264286155	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.00763914375086	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.212369628623	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.229706305676	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.379466704167	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.347917788883	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.873877344321	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.27670143925	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.712803898656	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.199653753366	Thank you.
0.0	0.493629798867	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.827617337882	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.22378720502	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.267909788463	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.174942078827	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.244670958104	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.644047406716	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
1.0	0.230610510427	That's wrong.
0.0	0.537700396898	Two points.
0.0	0.368464703169	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.725024968676	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
1.0	0.648897710336	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.65782590893	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.878855389418	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.787263637371	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.670754941027	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.390552839191	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.414207112949	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.254575059665	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.629001216345	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.363953524985	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.40487158303	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.195254940946	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.286655358934	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.232021863338	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.347252107421	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.271315947387	We have to do something.
0.0	0.31167004324	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.291322375609	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.176069764489	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.313744626438	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.585974216729	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.734498873731	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.

0.0	0.266599411978	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.353145096732	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.102591811239	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.163420813002	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.594588337661	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.519829800009	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
1.0	0.00628131522598	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.401756828826	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.5	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.132090952531	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.250242118497	Dynamically.
0.0	0.26041913635	I like Marco Rubio.

0.0	0.368542799009	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.

0.0	0.221251188518	So you might not.
1.0	0.926765794895	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.373707354851	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.339818302342	Growth is the answer.
1.0	0.933549032332	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.

0.0	0.269348878724	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.366468758448	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.182148030886	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.5	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
1.0	0.456126768756	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.260918698003	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.120596993129	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.445919916498	Marco voted on the other side.

0.0	0.270957336438	And we are not England.
0.0	0.20071264281	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.405138537517	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.602081797265	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.222315009349	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.218781752395	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.404269715554	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.5	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.213388675047	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.280909590892	We have no borders.
0.0	0.271268083118	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.338665708956	We are not France.
0.0	0.212927969264	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.390604980824	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.206176921544	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.4434215164	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.489061859537	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.310237987241	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.0599412992758	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.258661541799	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.21440983296	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.242075841658	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.264360116313	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.546370987327	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
1.0	0.775879613788	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.328427080136	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.17616404944	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.417767718505	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.282542196599	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.250242118497	Right.
0.0	0.38313714494	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.328498597162	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.522900392429	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.327677034706	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.828774122231	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.343628261708	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.351196277388	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.517909784608	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.319444625884	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...

0.0	0.568084299485	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.169866161977	I like it.
1.0	0.474836977671	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.364737076913	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.182474556174	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.329605668889	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.113012920288	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.194368904934	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.822089987886	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.25717919025	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.299634635086	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.

0.0	0.135393012448	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.973305445517	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.317225383002	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.491703542409	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.561664001279	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.938213228805	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.226978943017	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.0544576126601	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.545352513565	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.437763954143	We came back from the dead.

0.0	0.332039196215	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.178582996982	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.196189754457	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
1.0	0.320388221895	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.20264959657	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.0758699033108	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.162215324236	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.328674693102	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.315288328317	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.207920556904	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.251219076655	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.220119384543	It is a real horror.
1.0	0.911482942046	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.417484237971	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.299240227557	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.544838060448	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.

0.0	0.239421699606	to save a company.
0.0	0.385185039632	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.

0.0	0.0623496018089	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.151126166554	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.729112257046	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.942619118672	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
1.0	0.353631681172	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.335719273966	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.235765780188	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.

0.0	0.363944497211	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.442992673672	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.34506227702	That's fine.
0.0	0.63417831744	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.154555050631	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.150724862953	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

0.0	0.429859625349	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.132404670856	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.194128712345	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.134979118801	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.353501461887	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.108572296841	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.472089899263	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.269635421627	You have to lead.
0.0	0.145684991965	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.120289021951	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.147839919566	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.378871274803	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.409628996829	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.31268720827	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.358628501185	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.611838926772	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.215259398365	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.270011426079	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.858436980237	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.19045023033	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.542103053842	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
1.0	0.462625028546	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.364454380836	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.226508550762	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.122503189238	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.0793845695131	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.21163953668	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
1.0	0.371747494162	They stole it.
0.0	0.27929402169	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.690663325592	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.291994062952	They're a scam.
0.0	0.374819415284	She was right.
0.0	0.212476760268	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.265697763353	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.0321616326036	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.316056586507	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.353108263253	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.207897598694	OK.
0.0	0.617070836845	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.676044124328	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.526044444366	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.859841691611	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.189171351271	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.658131136021	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.

0.0	0.872823674539	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.384221430533	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.339702698185	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.224063407645	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.731391677074	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.5	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.

0.0	0.188749665417	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
1.0	0.781691693392	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.301354631603	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.469649393804	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.33763704764	We will win on everything we do.

0.0	0.0509691917384	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.161549430293	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.290203250576	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.510736350292	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.356425832257	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.207168187516	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.330584866191	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.522159044353	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.20537104146	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.190319995824	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.795909975918	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.441630964557	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.89406677285	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.25930061497	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.439484828234	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.666164204122	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.222980572494	I totally get that.
0.0	0.356014817268	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.609837393745	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.465690250318	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.

0.0	0.306375833932	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.413120575081	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.282457857294	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.207816370485	And for good cause.
0.0	0.530366205461	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.273169923126	That is not right.
0.0	0.230167011967	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.201986049124	No, it should be repealed.
1.0	0.761996672464	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.352104291318	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.766704514215	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.210919478299	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.520001165555	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.0334716274841	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.480251148327	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.761420665869	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.456403641918	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.650203353695	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.273997959835	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.199191203238	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.552141916293	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.231966541938	That's good.
0.0	0.163445522221	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.866215649896	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.267129187117	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.010544105302	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.342152556541	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.260922522196	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.717081032752	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.898830566048	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.274479268104	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.233782235317	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.393902224937	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.666604934136	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.122005567615	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.329095444988	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.092920157327	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.418368078017	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.393245078223	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.159739952614	I'd consider it.
1.0	0.665929050479	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
1.0	0.809012385207	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.220237850817	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.493535129243	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.291553978523	The number of women --
0.0	0.181184688807	You looking at me?
0.0	0.723363217466	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.400884201548	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.719667373225	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
1.0	0.139769640934	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.193243869917	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.443019993332	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.270803488772	I will be that new leader.
1.0	0.275593379943	This president is undermining our military.
1.0	0.915000391646	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.275101425271	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.5	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.234130999009	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.724447349039	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.703821969225	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.266888792753	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.126127832203	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.443557744511	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.388383804476	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.218475286694	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.431455637903	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.335903895659	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.414870692479	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
1.0	0.843325907306	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.508010581213	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.32127961687	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.285803166457	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.268908447041	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.449231184032	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.712608356791	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.47723636869	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.265554138089	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.720952240286	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.367036165037	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.322508336005	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.382743680628	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.147166350924	You just want to...
0.0	0.28336105171	On welfare.
0.0	0.401944651971	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.350718538677	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.723701349079	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.642166149524	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.160669804393	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.522126389562	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.382794224072	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.276883831087	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.887868722769	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.220557281715	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.61808669456	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.267906554922	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.249931784999	No, John.
0.0	0.330621520309	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.457041781243	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.383587145339	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.847711350471	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
1.0	0.942243898328	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.265130744741	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.881185823079	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.0908011416446	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.255098494326	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.303160599779	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.221258386114	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.0974504604602	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.352841142791	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.661946679634	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.614429036346	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.738484131889	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.305902273785	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.0604287022626	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.421420081633	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.393255274933	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.661537695057	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.207897598694	Yes.
0.0	0.454665916603	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.5	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.264651469906	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.284241538101	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.698178692365	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.306461729416	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.109423331892	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.152667857298	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.594592399719	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.5	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.253732253382	John.
0.0	0.441137718073	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.286409531222	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.482058695287	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.181810945678	You know why?
0.0	0.86839392663	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.266210178141	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.0752733354723	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.746940336576	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.289349663477	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.257449291932	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.454152691108	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.480038116026	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.

0.0	0.256273599554	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.011627611715	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.

0.0	0.526430015766	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.577364190157	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.194461799005	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.26415156736	It never happens.
0.0	0.688071477508	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.454017495707	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.434820095288	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.551162623504	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.244756637331	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.0990500159372	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.533141290977	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.336518558509	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.252354457616	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.300514322242	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.826665081596	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.303170772525	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.894024235427	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.138945280169	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.5	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.250242118497	Absolutely.
0.0	0.951000353578	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.493419130505	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.34667657122	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.377061374151	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.568963156376	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.48032806542	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.215943785411	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
1.0	0.7469885255	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.161042732235	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.480890705077	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.175948262911	It feels different.
0.0	0.410524082978	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.699502163367	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.22874067537	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.338177230368	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.347334679311	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.40018024614	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.79692596175	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.20906748287	You're welcome.
0.0	0.284765290249	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.394721596035	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.0756313572907	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.790668284034	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.373637811234	I was the architect.
0.0	0.42077973542	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.447141586524	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.316950868883	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.307401204514	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.547523816298	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.46778217479	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.828419403146	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.232798705818	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.862621421421	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.483658295791	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.174465062034	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.091933307624	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0283386344055	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
1.0	0.318622374808	They were wrong.
0.0	0.371317559794	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.25175871296	I win.
0.0	0.803569222784	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.243531230801	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.453299071293	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.302236941823	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.327442663926	You did.
0.0	0.152412861089	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.487993554962	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.0884873321972	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
1.0	0.300779097699	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.0883643627106	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.068177175276	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.392327739288	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.279420759649	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.176310471753	Why?
0.0	0.401738733787	Just for the record.
0.0	0.271957565806	The answer is no.
0.0	0.389523967382	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.694264897143	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.211907113718	He's wrong.
0.0	0.447904615063	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.288738814104	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.257114132131	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.249414710222	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.422137900581	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.419070079954	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.673797153132	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.073062741865	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.23020212829	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.256261797363	And, we said no.
0.0	0.436336928279	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.199675770444	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.762600379917	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.408786441083	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.378871274803	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.258988440367	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.589958157741	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.349128478252	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.538060137447	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.165624941572	I would just say that...
0.0	0.177433815024	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.5	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.415168594042	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.249021661495	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.126162679654	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.401121176212	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.297604216649	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.278400374957	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.425160609598	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.260487529753	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.343005124604	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
1.0	0.655632645006	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.51195339147	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.334826618459	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.265382129889	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.1811096383	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
1.0	0.238786257271	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.338275117015	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.361117391587	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.273215102322	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.271678425388	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
