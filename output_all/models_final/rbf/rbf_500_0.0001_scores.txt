0.0	0.196803436555	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.742214254315	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.296121306302	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.188267303356	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.183815114813	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.55784499034	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.197828088803	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.181720521221	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.166479703112	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.542078199338	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.603252897272	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.223860357712	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.718182103363	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.370948153404	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.315686903162	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.42503408909	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.808364807546	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.582748589912	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.720209381547	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.481582093039	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.237121416261	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.835638045321	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.298758856676	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.238253781569	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.475080950653	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.548336848618	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.362276244653	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.188183940192	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.349583052457	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.295997238549	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.225055023917	No.
1.0	0.711141457361	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.310532903041	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.656506212059	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.740264016469	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.331728096116	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.802017519306	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.0754854067312	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.160911012342	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.278851235236	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.717736868022	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.188666183087	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.275074447166	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.271015043212	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.5	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.993651520623	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.166416356878	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.111502404458	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.218651586127	You really can't.
0.0	0.845176071727	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.217074811126	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.233787558927	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.367203281094	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.332510135398	But here's the real key.
1.0	0.798197794397	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.387798066679	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.246719199991	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.281336459948	Divide that out.
0.0	0.655441975667	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.172147443467	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.273495920042	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.552511326525	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.129476910648	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.877797987074	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.475153893841	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.287107156696	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.544298225037	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.461826695038	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.300477279078	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.186729371821	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.196382870916	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.162494070509	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.229993371552	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.664064259909	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.267071777244	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.836264793658	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.284233732587	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.234834873238	In addition to that...
0.0	0.5	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
1.0	0.62227978741	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.600990509411	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.612155791668	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.344976826126	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.659937957212	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.469694772463	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.206987697159	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.591606613116	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.159098056598	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.179751638569	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.598810203121	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
1.0	0.449914013083	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.16540774363	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.277885374409	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.212823038378	We're running.
0.0	0.584986321477	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.276056195342	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.377705131052	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.267972221941	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.20948388503	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.193932653756	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.5	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.286819624611	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.293978737217	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.131170508341	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.213054635315	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.189990589465	Yes.
0.0	0.207215408675	I can't do it.
0.0	0.571199928166	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.434487174029	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.831555228906	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.13961196586	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.361186172644	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.777149470098	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.308143315606	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.115729115813	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.532635866185	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.194209747001	And God bless America.
0.0	0.173372871723	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.229188113812	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.806745467274	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.34434846254	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.247650300833	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.350327472245	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.228686784102	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.220749785402	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.915891568962	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.55189569552	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.836650656907	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.61122113401	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.264409786753	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.331125469977	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.445284136914	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.908008290089	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.726813542137	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.162848922977	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.696138490936	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.201946531015	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.222908795777	You do.
0.0	0.536089484004	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.436532485209	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.343115580264	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.946849830411	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.697542288223	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.370902805303	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.533907552133	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.446975329054	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.471660545026	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.321115464678	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.241074451772	We have to obey the laws.
1.0	0.219513187464	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.17314399968	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.0747193218436	And guess what?
0.0	0.910684940183	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.313819378582	We actually did it.
0.0	0.769159462434	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.31618563896	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.577406818973	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.258144940879	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.229864109771	It never happens.
0.0	0.905824885628	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
1.0	0.888880927363	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.404697373814	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.511867844882	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.479368621818	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.479308962798	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.5	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.190400827191	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.666101300082	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.353305062891	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.311335714381	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.219661375082	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.249372604984	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.138736304618	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.149450206909	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.226501504027	You know that.
0.0	0.265149292584	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.22214674342	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.605811549437	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.213847688202	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.971709406033	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.298154961832	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.735465886957	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.304328215665	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.154421230973	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.420703908707	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.292148499928	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.148984162768	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.313700591104	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.571132490491	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.40688120538	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.229708471168	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.515041474747	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.285818541714	That's not right.

0.0	0.261856877313	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.113501162349	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.594043756751	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.311191018894	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.565356997928	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.354397087639	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.403156650334	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.392858892179	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.26570276693	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.146266409915	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.352098904868	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.281749198727	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.403057063285	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.152847946033	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.231628032237	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.250668441472	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.238713538011	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.268974586763	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.0862157121695	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.169668188144	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.16659712605	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.185540602299	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.335117109323	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.222548496657	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.345648105549	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.824300864749	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.812439763739	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.

0.0	0.677548541557	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.241712959524	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.566450562284	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.756876651966	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.3454048499	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.218831602181	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
1.0	0.469474283958	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.756177010722	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.286223796662	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.302563647683	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.099832875883	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
1.0	0.614544716563	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.0902937408298	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.193022066054	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.7046849898	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.637417309852	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
1.0	0.904512404086	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.844265800549	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.149605309754	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.323469109158	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.375830032152	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.246425494551	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.636048577825	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.200640650588	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.330816600046	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.363407273571	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.207643841578	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.508076239644	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.357875830373	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.803662160763	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
1.0	0.307942395969	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.333955938713	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.316251255048	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.353010015423	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.124368832523	How great is that?
0.0	0.836379645049	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.651174834015	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.24031630597	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.446749652068	He hit oil.
0.0	0.672796801943	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.484598692109	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.912268567574	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.241764770291	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.435686164111	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.156305131268	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.274320984733	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.361780190597	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.481966795702	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.232328179371	Right.
0.0	0.151980544396	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.576737312632	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.27429891734	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.516804389101	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.424772254009	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.248518449664	This is 2016.
0.0	0.177172318952	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.0536110543812	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.716455737149	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.424398266344	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.266107619193	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.460653835433	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.680364077278	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.5	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.39127382223	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.281227949949	She said the truth.
0.0	0.457347107279	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.308846446212	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.301532413168	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.178523735688	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.252182452336	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.426865330715	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.136189609313	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.346014686644	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.541176184712	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.30219092861	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.441360020678	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.457673990913	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.240362862231	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.290987920608	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.360443196383	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.189837628496	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.240553733938	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.23652407054	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.283115957114	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.429754184051	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.651750620021	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.298019213451	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.407481693756	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.6481651591	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.15627328048	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.695236634744	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.677186728418	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.156762108696	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.580492377584	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.646592225484	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.552208764123	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.189990589465	Yes.
0.0	0.307651100936	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.329604813319	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.253645528092	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.437007776944	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.344660487897	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.482591129365	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.212415094063	in particular.
0.0	0.460095880914	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.703195955196	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.183063127684	You know why?
0.0	0.374336196131	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.386217666115	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.229193400501	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.195679989077	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.409737330944	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.300273785344	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.205641071153	That's for sure.
0.0	0.279371831554	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.0594075809913	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.207179295423	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.540741273878	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.489982282668	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.167008567054	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.84182274093	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.225055023917	No.
0.0	0.333381219428	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.49074565645	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.256527013306	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.30961057621	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.375793841617	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.664944018639	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.5	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.560653062734	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.258039078998	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.44518041448	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.205179440354	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.561341505858	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.210834082721	Think about that.
0.0	0.893396032939	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
1.0	0.645540651222	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.335190815047	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.317303106387	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.459631970623	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.225055023917	No.
0.0	0.327691318238	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.233530696809	And you know what?
0.0	0.893986182173	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.703886912851	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.348731506755	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.422024113274	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.417166248296	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.554600483989	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.562329617578	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.24969556112	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.0657539704083	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.405660672475	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.262544656853	Creativity.
0.0	0.542124553837	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.287832848968	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.438522310735	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.152892316089	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.596066477431	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.387564954861	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.143376376453	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.351448139679	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.446287671816	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.280259125623	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.160677500468	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.473598680557	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.887338418525	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.266466231435	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.632853928481	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.537437396618	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.197439416262	I'm aware of that.
1.0	0.855867028328	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.336385997222	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.338947864312	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.408188437163	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.333859765036	I didn't find it offensive at all.
1.0	0.740001514924	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.440675702115	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.482581390912	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.188736968492	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.377561852856	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.142709243815	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.400312606283	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.248761989613	Check it out.
0.0	0.221631139732	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.302764004527	Came out great.
0.0	0.273447179051	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.760213506789	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.367481445015	That never works.
0.0	0.296220248953	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.164265540209	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.571696015921	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.235950765396	About Medicare?
0.0	0.376567717714	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.13797829558	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.223698120936	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.114047954075	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.0855252613914	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.122488205161	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.0981288673357	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.217227468129	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.647281065224	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.238084454532	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.637510283903	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.142377406955	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.368792842458	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.197628361621	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.5	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.603556315653	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.529753312178	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.712882033282	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.24200986019	Our next president...
0.0	0.520199277597	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.477583775088	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.257584034285	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.795919337993	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.260250533306	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.353160927894	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.535280605336	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.376487850483	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.130182958063	Why is that?
0.0	0.322479672739	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.840949934694	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.645596417148	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.924246213441	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.617174357628	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
1.0	0.865262214772	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.233880463698	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.465038798018	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.639875966841	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.309706210728	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.18747235268	I don't care.
0.0	0.37923541698	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.0573215707379	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.284019712106	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.62707097497	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.526370794202	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.493483278921	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.269520572524	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.493266894345	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.20478421864	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.0835059361425	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.950967225704	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.59930296441	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.399194445602	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.223630616494	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.739830881763	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.51969983202	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.0612429673515	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.252327052735	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.459808387492	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.226592510872	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.809305266263	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.244437525313	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.468143134155	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.900568202359	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.546595102303	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.706081340924	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.486957165749	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
1.0	0.68372249195	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.167639700067	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.151722508604	How do I know this?
0.0	0.113600391852	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.509341725535	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.268080084835	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.359686887981	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.417468658118	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.516469818925	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.156276615224	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.146708432406	I understand.
0.0	0.180673059714	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.656913225684	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.225055023917	No.
1.0	0.311508910777	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.302199907634	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.543253027299	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.213719095094	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.773299842651	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.103495448181	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.959808349648	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.459539989695	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.293174049485	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.284242633299	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.926910049111	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.848345279158	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.188123710746	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.195118309369	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.31184733563	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
1.0	0.845629140969	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.547965074842	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.303638689795	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.470736278085	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.804784021523	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.278114546537	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.291170260499	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.474436651204	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.191515011963	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.595783803956	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.210413563016	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.242044714635	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.109436309134	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.517135365285	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.59301009181	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.651961759879	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.384407918452	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.468839804435	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.5	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.378370651249	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.159552391304	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.267707722283	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.565189530849	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.530976934032	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.274344055987	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.146507642035	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.717087023592	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.286473889222	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.307028469802	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.161315413323	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.680538637359	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.567903939768	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.0804922669218	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.410122428604	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.604671300379	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.183282284606	Well, sure.
0.0	0.5	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.781257390383	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.464432730445	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.49238573236	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.125957524417	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.670637526264	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.219992852644	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.732514042502	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.232333462607	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.343632730846	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.254362394452	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.332128466827	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.311165026077	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.361625300675	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.233707307016	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.290923612423	I got that.
0.0	0.109735679153	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.174249158617	It's a joke.
0.0	0.206108776825	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.342624378222	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.449731077859	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.226538323149	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.309837777096	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.25131179622	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.144832455834	I like that.
0.0	0.803346714091	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.164810525641	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.224176989704	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.652537897759	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.379444742648	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.907856278955	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.605745455419	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.55463570415	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.255096690976	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.854340942844	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.505581824028	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.278793639557	Not bad.
0.0	0.554705569097	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.80522096088	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.550840551231	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.538866174915	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.84553696323	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.145328092298	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.393292749229	They're sick of politics as usual.
1.0	0.550871938882	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.867350362077	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.250496400636	You don't have to.
0.0	0.0166007875626	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.155126705972	We're going to start the process of securing that border.

0.0	0.433681519175	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.215689367622	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.354122013476	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.250782582142	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.216597716077	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.511029658821	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.586398030139	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.352353297726	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.828374710362	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.189990589465	Yes.
0.0	0.618886840152	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.311913100551	It was.
0.0	0.0411994642622	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.320477218572	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.385736169363	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.789829302462	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.222386310797	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.164091664591	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.661195615299	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.286117621909	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.119443315865	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.211675504712	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.0977973647004	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.34124850041	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.38041885677	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.367108495201	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.303963288665	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.186695969825	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.478540852315	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.188007032943	I'll say this.
0.0	0.91546810297	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.165679528902	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.510807292996	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.477126845867	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.316787765486	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.25541267972	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.0862023254538	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.273811123026	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.877228819385	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.0614646353744	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.141991008693	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.292057393191	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.914865692158	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.337232022039	But I was born here.
0.0	0.52426514356	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.423276502808	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.297086555896	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.534020019585	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.169980737261	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.695594638706	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.506320253125	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.0486245619194	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.149758380986	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.227430987455	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.192613819744	It is.
0.0	0.792971678035	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.9158122144	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.304019400926	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.551429724431	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.82576524275	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.276263780933	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.404873683406	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.328467589412	We were wrong.
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.0882439325992	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.343431352957	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.559377886139	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.339546982486	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.469037851481	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.281207253977	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.825878281551	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.202673265407	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.207215408675	We can't do it.
0.0	0.138549802239	I think he is right.
0.0	0.0136773427113	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.122632859606	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.0939255229624	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.75993337718	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.0155582420143	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.233048033015	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.585020783008	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.136049976807	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.303264581306	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
1.0	0.85783617212	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.241982294839	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.0424337574225	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.176108162786	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.756778985934	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.415269432012	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.553751458199	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.305481529354	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.13230782421	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.370856551157	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.111897510219	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.233530696809	But you know what?
0.0	0.150115796873	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
1.0	0.248734467238	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.669042518752	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.280416465537	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.109800599719	It's true.
0.0	0.189991953373	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.407703184461	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.197022883042	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.230810056292	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.36657452297	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.684659174612	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.542705092507	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.815473088449	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.539243197087	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.140876597277	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.347834675961	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.60341005219	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.190606417399	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.313748228585	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.725510436987	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.206632696608	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.257578850259	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.156884625793	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.238477335792	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.0600847826193	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.408529411911	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.369175625206	He is a good man.
0.0	0.272689438309	That has not been...
0.0	0.265793795794	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.5	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.527759919591	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.359136828946	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.362966537603	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.240445159644	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.522023318902	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.535649690322	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.751906743803	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.330659453517	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.129303254318	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.646961016509	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.247778215386	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.951793332043	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.173029948574	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.221397780388	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.403682710272	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.525837022536	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.855421547371	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.489048997382	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.425445986039	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.632445982144	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.277406873115	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.251127691628	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.159260948492	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.312199481941	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.425997182276	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.230829552402	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.637730996911	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.5	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.604847336332	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.101548127765	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.360376114737	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.549553474827	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.536302758747	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.574907661228	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.509533325749	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.422783801956	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.5	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.48473253591	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.736228713892	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.790571613763	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.245630588033	That will change everything.
0.0	0.525934633243	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.10561593425	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.0601564630573	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.141632402994	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.175114170139	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.429891828214	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.339546490156	I never said that.
0.0	0.464798811308	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.33526167637	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.267789867773	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.849484685427	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.662288013634	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.312377219847	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.116044623342	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.849914601826	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.228277545765	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.358267488095	That's fine.
0.0	0.394257264593	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.26501362538	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.418991747779	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.226973623425	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.261192103728	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.154125154391	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.334082263971	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.194560863382	...
0.0	0.117538617594	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.133730737947	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.772342775277	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.796617195454	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.336152904251	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.365539864511	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.723260947793	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.43203254243	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.253498214379	They cause dishonesty.
1.0	0.611138105719	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.306259870092	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.607421069611	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.160816851462	You find me...
0.0	0.387741308256	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.410406467539	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.539875666207	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.482228310536	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.5	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.129911087388	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.346077343373	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.345901240347	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.227555852963	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.286850949893	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.298171349118	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.423975591996	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.540508207944	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.79869413109	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.583857423474	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.443386663275	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.632774476305	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.597741775919	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.772969109962	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.391361207821	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.222908795777	I do.
0.0	0.52117068555	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.311301070903	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.0955013813656	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.0738192803091	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.79581683518	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.212869893527	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.35177162787	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.780196619662	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.683575074084	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.77689472778	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.539765233951	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.213160971897	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.59787315542	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.344944346672	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.206297846566	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.633129488155	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.431960560973	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.741434424484	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.544265519809	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.489307389303	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.188272253035	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.127142663664	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.381036912224	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.405978770247	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.353471674195	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.271498894738	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.1789878268	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.242650656227	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.224941815378	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.369669620036	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.174651867072	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.425790581336	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.437592873799	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.08871377627	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.554435333325	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.173664748287	That is...
0.0	0.287574575937	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.225037549686	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.221750858019	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.127733537248	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.309989261169	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.0843692081794	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.234698500547	We're not doing it.
1.0	0.53870665255	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.564791892255	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.798824815998	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.357858330754	Good at email.
0.0	0.238831011663	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.851401639491	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.51067023949	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.203852083044	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.608638393664	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.13050839588	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.345752772106	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.17295209336	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.0851380351649	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.805786062163	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.274430638611	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.435825024628	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.241019957119	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.0877485972004	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.0715011185371	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.30867481704	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.184655840515	Think about it.
0.0	0.225055023917	No.
0.0	0.194560863382	...
0.0	0.515384886354	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.603940771334	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.378423776812	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.228053803662	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.297679163918	He got lucky with fracking.
1.0	0.935807736201	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.536418278045	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.334957723683	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.309652979827	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.320791105467	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.341483797454	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.846125476651	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.186609635593	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.218653175304	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.342861536213	I know every one.
0.0	0.361658094822	That's the difference.
0.0	0.929771984113	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.571087395086	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.233530696809	And you know what?
0.0	0.276428603143	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.377877173229	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.156230350694	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.34171533708	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.815716582828	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.145159140347	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.563748681643	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.200346975438	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.296289895403	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.727253688866	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.141426489007	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.959951112575	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.876629009675	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.290393177464	I've done it.
0.0	0.648303613837	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.606025554512	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.0822283649105	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.433994283912	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.213393836797	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.704763929558	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.384232420115	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.194648251655	You bet they do.
0.0	0.235920315458	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.437731866799	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.443740890621	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.707940471661	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.239102996887	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.656270694355	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
1.0	0.543481519177	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.290150163893	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.323580707231	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.361328739601	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.62183630204	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.562355261046	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.206360296006	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.532090521104	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.565549557836	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.216792009346	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.260623533911	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.142474192502	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.318357415509	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.464032783542	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.317664100467	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.0363865590897	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.520414583871	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.109381288712	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.842966308356	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.735465886957	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
1.0	0.270683289267	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.18237105956	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.307127118483	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.0907643400818	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.199033701341	I want security.
0.0	0.465958265043	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.371655369742	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.34116749743	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.158847990765	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.336353443641	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.360377014767	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.

0.0	0.295665036702	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.434324827264	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.334540005794	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.389647411937	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.225055023917	No.
0.0	0.407477430711	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.694368052293	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.

0.0	0.485157401031	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.260574756213	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.885075356005	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.24314886301	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.269591537003	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.505350435327	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.156802985514	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.323054542618	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.313151621891	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.189991953373	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.176447491625	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.310267945245	That's not true.
0.0	0.235061691364	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.243757889481	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.0673710021724	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.0270600056869	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.595806508107	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.214562076254	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.189277387885	I love China.

0.0	0.333038715096	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.178181300784	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.546330723624	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.195855520008	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.161984890128	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.211432610502	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.349110301074	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.278391956101	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.607129180341	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.287010011682	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.228742418582	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.24073878595	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.723319904095	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.689961312238	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.281998087439	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.22200115506	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.298430667282	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.262856896845	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.1844184815	So...
0.0	0.694092387099	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.436100830644	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.309041831564	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.435139864212	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.3385361384	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.594353343555	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.350727432321	I have no idea.
0.0	0.237225292712	We don't win.
0.0	0.337582953824	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.446288951995	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.252010862791	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.417720345488	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.862306971601	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.596594292986	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.437978604999	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.649805425963	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.516492968405	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.438710349638	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.356071218905	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.138285776304	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.170382885916	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.490607388071	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.812176440457	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.27756172001	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.455017894042	It's driving up stock prices.
1.0	0.287320149388	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.616010048767	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
1.0	0.597933689053	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.449423161297	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.393748767057	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.332354143248	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.349061596467	Do we still have standards?
1.0	0.381493941865	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.161916909769	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.902919253225	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.36138601232	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.31021716072	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.5663654905	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.347204595786	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.697063094203	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.217847936466	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
1.0	0.583509342562	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.177852754283	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.562693988551	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.102240791623	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.136355864671	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.886018702095	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
1.0	0.978129353099	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.279328398632	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.297673795542	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.0886049789508	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.528258510311	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
1.0	0.679293297834	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.121107811039	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.226348822895	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.667336245534	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.246620604595	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.346911356354	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.188895801288	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.374892094529	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.553536266031	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.

0.0	0.605984757439	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.621088165585	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.311088704223	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.915566221014	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.0858317249416	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.650078812821	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.222159306025	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.827097319066	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.721141900833	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.132451587089	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.135116601323	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.46120349049	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.400025106679	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.281513198101	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.373406870222	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.309170271724	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.251040775724	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.

0.0	0.531613413827	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
1.0	0.833133811375	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.255344970089	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.26222006633	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.

0.0	0.375124214286	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.294719371572	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.475828344724	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.619938643446	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0643222068041	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.342673926101	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.453131950807	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.279774157429	My background is different.

0.0	0.333899197286	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.582922461987	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.217997061135	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.717878505968	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.355978981952	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.

0.0	0.261945233556	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.380988375015	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.387412692239	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
1.0	0.157883748866	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.647361380677	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.580384712619	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.368946948201	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.376988380833	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.

0.0	0.247494590188	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.191933593569	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.104826754108	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.674303994464	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.147677484374	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.

0.0	0.389738681033	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.175585077253	(inaudible).
0.0	0.558316457755	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.189990589465	OK?
0.0	0.632844448841	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.375491623047	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.36196305509	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.364558907337	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.806136112774	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.

0.0	0.354084740863	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.

0.0	0.835544211215	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.610462439411	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.205216393995	I can do that.
0.0	0.202784359304	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.564053133855	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.579090713398	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.431727682684	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.094970293693	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.

0.0	0.134540379851	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.157243500374	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.828473467059	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.868810988245	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.525409687756	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.219072398402	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.323123688984	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.177219714604	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.373110365743	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.0926719155081	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.

0.0	0.264926461491	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.273023601876	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.748854625814	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.63605390148	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.196714599379	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.166310301615	I would change them.
0.0	0.245876703122	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.36941717116	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
1.0	0.863308298254	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.102480583578	I think you're --
0.0	0.473814823223	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.339633511001	It's not that complicated actually.
1.0	0.860360426393	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.647609425847	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.619910524147	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.768390232115	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
1.0	0.792918015707	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.309944112073	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.547761464426	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.176190127013	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.427198775842	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.623786914602	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.366155615261	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.942514595911	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.251746149799	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.211343838251	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.565248732162	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.346161997395	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.983822577023	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.350323598923	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.381077310686	Folks, we've got to wake up.
1.0	0.954526801147	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.118392187226	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.489084138814	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.160657310744	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.4714351163	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.219032212548	OK, good.
0.0	0.286918588943	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.316962412949	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.370222421943	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.265638577231	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.450605584662	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.814662169341	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.096895727819	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.402784902405	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.288619790206	So you know what?
0.0	0.181675367574	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.215788018366	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.564455054443	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.233548484706	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.0956277875901	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.53853583165	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.535967797917	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.442382447725	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.512713235867	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.131512525934	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.115979932492	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.515354395217	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.166454555819	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.246296352653	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.307180832758	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
1.0	0.985637332047	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.370894997888	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.222908795777	We do.
0.0	0.522806405311	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.201571642158	It's their money.
0.0	0.233530696809	And you know what?
0.0	0.306895620541	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.421097868279	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.721066319392	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.489542984612	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.493103229594	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.207192653344	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.0839870340234	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.118705240525	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.659811288619	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.54842434648	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.714471932295	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.25522841033	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.0568440161961	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.675642753887	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.183576111499	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.9201416567	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.169904997803	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.359391278845	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.160592987375	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.104202493222	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.238924529979	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.376280010227	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.492230009559	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.743960697664	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.116939092179	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.458002527114	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.307706562968	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.77029619223	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.32319355972	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.47530435627	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.585502151401	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.139151266246	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.533469937084	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.22302790277	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.152401868583	...Chris...
0.0	0.202013867182	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.160136071801	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.575145799241	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.522864639056	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.394163055171	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.328301039854	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.445827330019	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.685653747397	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.131345690455	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.145785931596	And our economy was growing like crazy.
1.0	0.72170861193	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.265046788438	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.323169191292	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.102957050679	No, it's true.
0.0	0.533893769895	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.109850588642	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.521895424188	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.477598454757	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.668415037494	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.288062282241	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.288604154408	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.110300521456	And...
0.0	0.340928166946	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.563822493116	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.651946590465	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.246600813913	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.43360347401	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.566382345231	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.295580073205	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.337669860528	White people?
0.0	0.136983713767	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.0529366151007	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.0954631098003	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0830888994329	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.592175186366	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.439116942854	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.460462878037	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.35923768305	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.243404257611	I have fully endorsed those.

0.0	0.543311278364	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.550958391706	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.360802729215	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.

0.0	0.626114418007	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.115355439934	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.386860938523	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.

0.0	0.7553504044	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.161229930086	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.425220913261	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.314542876229	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
1.0	0.412332210274	Very few children.
0.0	0.331815212455	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.416458092025	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.706229288807	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.447664865039	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.563536880958	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.462447879418	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.762215468905	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.247545431405	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.218308411492	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.312869707851	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.110985389747	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.188460989772	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.3303983877	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.268804257241	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.282007592369	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.708654070904	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.533421330082	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0604131746051	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.809168054809	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.0286447007134	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.467025461464	He was on the board.
0.0	0.1732100326	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.336639277378	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.329452574003	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.7879176789	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.927761432404	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.70945451656	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.204945021329	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.238495598962	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.299182817906	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.14981748177	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.313505566891	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.231771146591	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.436183131018	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.232503519771	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.285818541714	That's not right.
0.0	0.638411777766	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.263725886104	You're right.
0.0	0.623598590792	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.214090585024	No, no.
0.0	0.705453700176	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.

0.0	0.356275576464	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.694697160197	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.157535057132	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.46456283933	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.293613460639	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.0213126273539	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.477621215195	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.156785165818	But I would add this.
0.0	0.184693033504	This will end.
0.0	0.595985284504	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.748646970239	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.357317832596	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.284663740258	That's right.
0.0	0.81520304235	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.832465230538	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.187806698285	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.55383383661	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.827545060466	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.890204501223	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.389656295514	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.403638333759	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.816425599273	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.394508106977	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.207829987083	And so do I.
0.0	0.0390241282256	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.305517724834	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.107074041301	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.210011021366	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.672070160416	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.764951549369	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.149841066448	...Thank you.
0.0	0.185061813533	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.292063880494	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.825927483791	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.404494689734	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.13565302423	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.221299093973	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
1.0	0.337477283934	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.237853327476	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.286912501402	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.138723100567	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.37400399297	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.194297862715	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.224834877427	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.186018008949	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.145877395504	That's my view.
0.0	0.31474175254	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.835275588171	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
1.0	0.817249978541	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.726454026278	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.668830807035	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.391346148914	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.728150016377	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.275269141021	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.328654876571	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.333319548135	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.136248865793	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.0771969217975	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.6148558881	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.240098311923	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.343023931662	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.252854822392	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.542570461817	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.389913271944	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.396151789316	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.674593895786	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.39514879943	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.446358918001	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.58639665456	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.5	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.385878627122	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.487381603578	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
1.0	0.625560843568	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.515955331206	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.310638752811	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.870983746204	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.328442422826	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.40611439832	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.33309108637	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.676926626622	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.377457088441	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.689829838364	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.160682935684	What should we do?
0.0	0.607453694895	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.235609896614	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.407149935505	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.179011660735	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.232686608198	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.322781135252	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.189990589465	OK.
0.0	0.388290118062	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.217664616291	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.144062452197	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.450876013249	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.395147633824	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.862678874297	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.662433366377	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.189990589465	OK?
0.0	0.2005899817	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.306196013563	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.378187486704	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.140668724578	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.186963258321	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.171850797708	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.400781846657	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.481947902551	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.19891263976	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.815270923272	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.317960606209	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.397635737329	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.142959082067	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.478597583825	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.233530696809	And you know what?
0.0	0.338984802009	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.339546490156	I never said that.
0.0	0.434769239025	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.652133360605	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.387934022479	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.227834510507	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.52491185514	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.0313978887314	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.279268971088	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.313489649852	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.810120842062	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.385882411212	A brief response.
0.0	0.548819881264	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.48366867069	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.377850653994	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.592557829513	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.32322941074	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.51335993523	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.224097621215	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.76331146659	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.766522015331	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.261190779604	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.401897663489	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.4284284042	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.329350941554	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.418027464649	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.38246076563	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.160956810618	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.468425523113	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.241662037933	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.184429108474	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.259137152322	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.40730894298	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.123644961326	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.0895223241523	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.398412840424	I was not at all.
0.0	0.299701646053	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.250874084125	They're Muslim.

0.0	0.147381756794	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.181525542209	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.29795822292	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.623166739009	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.432400779981	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.334239531948	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.406360570043	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.233811584882	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.527281600751	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.349656636349	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.613343001798	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.127438350606	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.112305192255	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.104370356933	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.15458297618	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.0551614355043	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.272754979272	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.668923535017	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.387522040314	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.391086205303	I said no.

0.0	0.438317776036	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.

0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.602076926908	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.233656867984	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.322054039029	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.

0.0	0.591840641664	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.5	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.268027059791	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.152044916989	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.229360815494	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.491189281613	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.31419252054	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.

0.0	0.355248406624	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.278464384397	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.5	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.152957539708	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.210894667339	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
1.0	0.714608268191	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.528905841561	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.275180083628	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.242764761777	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.204662223456	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.561321492282	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.944784299597	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.23901472856	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.599080085354	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.467266803729	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.823865399546	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.737548774685	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.207952752998	We don't need that.
0.0	0.446170673028	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.213575752403	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.761076793357	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.352204441889	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.250088603864	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.0722866007059	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.54349966629	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.560644118356	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.1144762209	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.349525768767	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.0888758819583	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.163779435041	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.457817896105	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.259310455695	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.475682673069	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.981675261547	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.567379155566	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.548447322812	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.630824532978	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.186052973817	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.291945336658	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.538475056296	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.416525056966	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.668656534043	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.552086824551	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.638955957105	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.5	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.0751395222193	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.178201747301	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.175794388056	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.18767163453	See?
0.0	0.297149537582	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.487616612829	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.123745820985	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.512866521195	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.832379297686	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.13983534392	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.726921949143	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.251158112114	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.120242637546	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.31228689575	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.380846570115	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.541784459484	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.427011747864	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.458565110211	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.286688959842	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
1.0	0.643831579064	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.739824773853	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.245511411034	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.641633472342	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.350130146279	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.238342734311	You do the arithmetic.
1.0	0.0967773321911	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.471875362726	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.463968950217	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.373618593545	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.475321100256	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.15062587745	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.186564425989	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.643908251968	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.789310841051	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.197573969062	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.400317603031	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.29016575319	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.5	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.417620846834	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.240655487145	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.124133097746	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.392131562332	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.365890606603	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.469854665518	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.431667229636	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.0347157778202	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.5	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.233088892364	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.262137916146	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.17866528619	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.671826131736	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.390553563909	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.136177500298	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.449329823051	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.656104769677	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.47710014073	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.357985357663	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.507185046905	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.313683063024	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.339912329661	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.544266321999	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.0924752397114	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.150166777151	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.583036848533	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.152401868583	...John...
0.0	0.0382474465769	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.219882364778	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.481985234675	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.365135953623	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.309153931724	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.211050858558	We need security.
0.0	0.155060221061	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
1.0	0.874793461222	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.0840710664158	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.360227604385	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.395999104543	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.0848714093895	And here's why.
0.0	0.294085901379	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.219282271293	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.394916573467	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.635757293502	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.377908117009	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.3163753083	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.346163718626	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.739867043954	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.428840450018	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.538658332564	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.333780783575	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.667438583146	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.433328922221	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.179832864138	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.363767535009	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.146389656839	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.252547711254	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.372187406147	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.317417954668	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.143494152454	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.475257980119	We're a country of laws, Bill.

0.0	0.288097133866	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.451478418911	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.20598980719	They expect to have it.

0.0	0.399020786216	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
1.0	0.445437629039	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.0968213185303	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.310689134289	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.185119133052	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.372681294686	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.294628622827	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.227205557718	Let's talk about our campaigns.
1.0	0.835379798592	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.365321303662	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.219775684182	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.673361520246	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.283452416546	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.250405917855	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.449614190181	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.337016706681	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.349042698752	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.720890815184	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.230609620623	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.178262831842	These...
0.0	0.320627012283	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.510517594995	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.543126273675	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.225055023917	No.
0.0	0.331353154973	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.191466644175	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.683246894288	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.29418320019	I've laid out...
0.0	0.686076085437	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.268796638505	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.586261619086	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.207584690433	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.177037533238	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.263755734809	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.37080612601	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.357922949992	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.139581939079	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.263078485153	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.298813096936	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.294448170284	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.336847047167	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.272901844196	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.373218220722	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.427000375251	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.311377856703	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.271830318338	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.293570669946	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.437212391175	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.741061850002	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.606034054764	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.425056168976	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.733552473135	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.823392275384	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.632704605194	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.232328179371	Absolutely.
0.0	0.128810530665	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.546791779136	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.242712745569	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.175382619506	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.12110418116	That's why I ask for your support for president.
1.0	0.559360943274	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.349563678558	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.2179208193	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.750001160164	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.0796393061505	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.70780245408	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.233427732871	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.228649095732	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.203973800595	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.373875703822	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.514420459582	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.277442377399	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.542143845212	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.197663598431	We need sound money.
0.0	0.225801244518	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.375850858882	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.342399855707	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.132702938317	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.251887545991	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.5	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.0809306536346	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.290906132298	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.230732103806	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.271427635805	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.247189346212	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.224223111908	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.280120745473	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.329767964203	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.494046674307	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.27073460362	...income tax...
0.0	0.360878245318	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
1.0	0.184825771449	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.365247032245	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.424718481855	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.309914659825	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.647274697299	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.116939092179	But if you look at working men and women.
1.0	0.704624042309	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.189000643985	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.234698500547	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.347758268318	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.5	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.0590350276254	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.277616983671	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.36703384242	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.421182953618	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.517484477298	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.114530010554	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.753145135857	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.511903663067	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.136297706549	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.260766134156	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.0894214234027	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.113854825619	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.473493559301	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.733519229941	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.154966960226	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.

0.0	0.224595263259	And I say that to Nikki.

0.0	0.061242121228	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.380466484667	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.

0.0	0.265985880693	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.407049440878	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.633210456523	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.233530696809	And you know what?
0.0	0.544297072164	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.818877655717	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.690238365793	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.508519824082	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.5	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.621996093731	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.334556433792	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.142145615682	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.189990589465	Yeah.
0.0	0.572416766788	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.449317763374	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.272905693551	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.527207576087	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.201807012363	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.249897234131	He's wrong.
0.0	0.193325216102	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.0904514186196	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.353493994113	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.380549752067	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.279612895393	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.103927960848	And why?
0.0	0.851009150275	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.34055659334	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.375292768192	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.517775850061	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.0360214745922	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.357326165274	They're a scam.
0.0	0.530694773099	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.791750421672	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.157662146427	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.61994023791	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.209020627828	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.304702917745	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.232328179371	Right.
0.0	0.200363940456	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.254520597628	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.66054055405	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.488269850094	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.185141278562	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.568921263201	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.35795526718	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.542275237249	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.230672936501	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.205737952072	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.341355906648	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.530550721707	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.688612211505	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.238116946388	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.129528854892	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.865262214772	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.252782404507	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
1.0	0.662630026514	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.187466233608	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.0784562568772	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.699854474855	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
1.0	0.835309596789	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.449859949009	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.241245553945	John?
0.0	0.741079290648	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.156921394161	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.361135721313	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.267593002896	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.223133406071	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.300989237747	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.145718594794	But look...
0.0	0.251548566611	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.531276557348	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.203633153371	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.331969313257	You're simply not.
0.0	0.341158384635	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.367941626511	That's what I said.
0.0	0.205951404341	That's what he is.
0.0	0.22184347335	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.24566775104	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.34273216866	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.367839216871	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.902447242598	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.792033376772	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.399983593368	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.658423607415	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.378366636455	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.190265409801	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.292221322028	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.188007032943	I will do that.
0.0	0.470790293344	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.802800135194	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.543244317988	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.161736757471	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.474954689453	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.764102253592	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.455550342586	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.173129679871	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.244033499528	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.35319375095	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.819186761044	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.381589447889	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.183044222603	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.162936222399	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.548839350489	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.373696063369	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.529743599665	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.207824964618	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.0450328539625	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.600012453416	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.301492051031	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.204584983197	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.115055214435	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.241245553945	Alright.
0.0	0.430102330112	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.194560863382	...
0.0	0.207461158254	No their not.
0.0	0.0767280220584	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.789729560736	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.313509769374	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.312804081688	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.298600946846	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.119234526414	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.217876836949	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.510937500053	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.409618526685	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.222581935207	Illegal.
0.0	0.352110989844	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.155977732748	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.578367408827	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.252376053269	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.141554406319	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.345197000149	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.710533931437	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.581893483364	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.279684443721	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
1.0	0.806913889449	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.5	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.581139992695	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.557342460948	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.176286880652	I have...
0.0	0.689868424677	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.223904484157	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.5783192192	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.560975923288	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.601839132365	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.245023779891	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.714219629223	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.157337785906	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.0744262137318	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.140441707001	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.724527234167	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.393997972697	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.207745858546	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.248157406934	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.102423712026	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.547399580449	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.382935783789	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.121934493541	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.954950766385	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.401245409771	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.101516581133	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.379964090671	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.756459031235	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.098126907707	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.300153825224	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.38280903574	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.143555677343	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.449442113381	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.682584650562	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.477476327742	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.106379749147	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.536123484061	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.261639739693	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.255757732901	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.203582187651	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.625006713877	He just writes out an order, executive order.

1.0	0.939071132137	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.742854728741	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.606030324196	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.880872756586	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.391011971787	I didn't say permanently.

0.0	0.981812270585	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.394433348293	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.211314601004	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.700379391745	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.

0.0	0.411930674437	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.313300058056	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.704524210012	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.

0.0	0.627373188223	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.185286897292	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.131380867353	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.

0.0	0.355561779554	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.225781951853	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.0572446607261	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.226815895054	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.234459730533	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.41574788708	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.182615500042	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.351634484389	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.310224025626	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.264238060446	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.577770029923	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.920256156059	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.28987201145	Big difference.
0.0	0.884828649612	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.392556704389	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.296039776242	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.316615356732	No vision at all.

0.0	0.197741708614	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.724789923753	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.814924961357	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.240410362481	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.110779253221	I agree with them.
0.0	0.255891572899	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.254025422291	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.137754733029	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.207952752998	I don't like that.
0.0	0.975711950972	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.64582359967	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.483280245837	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.471606833156	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.475055555164	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.349068740442	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.213940754786	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.684770138317	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.253233611934	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.0856815736232	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.120933242009	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.514390199841	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.60101727503	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.441178373827	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.702347849564	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.247373280703	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.575950685548	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.199365760534	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.203169928212	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.448242949234	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.441280446629	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.780628645544	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.189990589465	Okay.
0.0	0.257717275348	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.167777721318	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.215002160784	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.686411621293	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.219988483753	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.791534664944	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.604967243495	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.540086714502	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.759967101033	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.138778471835	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.674834197554	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.578138311989	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.808994813252	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.626560567608	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.603205192577	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.331180334471	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.432639235468	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.35310895107	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.14306291578	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.546758177843	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.910238529675	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
1.0	0.565235353751	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.220969349731	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.455431835663	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.273089812319	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.533276704979	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.44629468876	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.297124477875	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
1.0	0.932803033697	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.512345853167	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.679362273514	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
1.0	0.571427437767	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.152401868583	...Chris...
0.0	0.381207699222	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.808109051871	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.591443995062	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
1.0	0.361361435177	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.0912469274914	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.724403321855	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.406118276117	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.31936987232	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.346346472302	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.578725760106	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.85355297004	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.153362171461	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.524005815524	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.146641544002	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.71893635835	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.43084637359	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.476391250999	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.32770700966	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.305928488924	I want security for this country.
1.0	0.935643304623	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.559478851245	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.357928946184	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.307240538327	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.287956908666	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.453816329796	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.240563719613	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
1.0	0.610356636595	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
1.0	0.624567158825	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.0013235076486	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.231277429925	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.189402793523	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.39289778473	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.394923068809	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.646610260775	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.274173281061	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.679526423141	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.188736968492	Thank you.
0.0	0.481261591737	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.801096261385	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.244296271693	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.314293346761	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.203812717504	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.224713901828	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.669525008744	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
1.0	0.292440739601	That's wrong.
0.0	0.586962550853	Two points.
0.0	0.40599665814	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.795269907247	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
1.0	0.692706921249	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.630130306765	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.859757737356	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.743034210228	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.724944918714	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.39086969191	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.47272398516	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.26931305223	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.376511728946	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.373710322545	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.38441768144	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.156985483424	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.230890508576	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.266870541809	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.36126917654	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.276917304331	We have to do something.
0.0	0.238643866828	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.347450647214	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.139650766244	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.293782253879	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.633527151182	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.69916730942	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.

0.0	0.60439404478	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.626048447812	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
1.0	0.0374252659235	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.310419865293	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.199956203132	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.259958561234	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.

0.0	0.198152887774	So you might not.
1.0	0.932921897386	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.248715905723	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.337118320709	Growth is the answer.
1.0	0.946876691668	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.

0.0	0.419865958454	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.298829445628	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.521475160538	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
1.0	0.460543926076	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.321411848379	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.

0.0	0.240797253984	And we are not England.
0.0	0.165552332285	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.381458744323	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.509935559045	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.121793535426	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.21249684945	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.467644430233	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.608120372294	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.146407935946	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.231769007521	We have no borders.
0.0	0.287136554518	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.31743912122	We are not France.
0.0	0.177304297043	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.450036288223	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.178938108516	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.48227694951	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.527932924922	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.307046120162	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.0771494905334	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.238114423691	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.248972806296	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.253712862294	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.238054917642	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.650768999017	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
1.0	0.815745746262	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.280463857943	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.269068468717	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.522049415286	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.29806012735	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.232328179371	Right.
0.0	0.5	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.221557548766	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.491905758378	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.29938221919	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.791994416367	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.289895154111	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.369550978848	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.524167259191	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.183438933699	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...

0.0	0.169299016163	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.372714842389	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.151608627333	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.259235742215	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.

0.0	0.112320379926	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.980121229922	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.299821077908	Here is where we are with public education.

0.0	0.409057939631	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.879019589383	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.227208164814	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.0965216935991	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.

0.0	0.205816910894	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
1.0	0.317470468968	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.10704117342	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.0759106496075	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.115394156519	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.

0.0	0.302435232763	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.218898271586	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.211726157526	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.234095082305	It is a real horror.
1.0	0.920644123491	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.297928444689	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.342070219318	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.546577780178	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.

0.0	0.592928879337	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.865772406777	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.

0.0	0.373614862852	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.482323316724	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.358267488095	That's fine.
0.0	0.700985015031	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?

0.0	0.118935926515	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

0.0	0.433117651005	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.114332249635	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.171888297595	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.148513049775	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.370889768105	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.103915823726	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.443254070437	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.303540511981	You have to lead.
0.0	0.110885622478	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.653353533444	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.150568716462	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.371127653579	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.43660260943	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.341828154981	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.400569689276	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.620362915213	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.170997298701	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.274320589775	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.769755375239	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.145898773462	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.514972270438	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
1.0	0.455203742148	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.295147889184	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.157349758936	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.183913483122	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.10827732186	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.262635209321	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
1.0	0.378902945858	They stole it.
0.0	0.291038405855	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.555099418789	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.286346067583	They're a scam.
0.0	0.362493801641	She was right.
0.0	0.191786973264	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.293707729853	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.237696810225	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.201438704476	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.351521429422	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.189990589465	OK.
0.0	0.630547145093	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.719043889181	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.553658134571	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.737394334208	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.13624314723	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.

0.0	0.320246400958	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.908135420101	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.242099456054	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.553687185301	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.64186344463	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.429423116363	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.86738733634	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.331533778979	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.329334177945	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.320210135077	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.74681949867	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.589977440736	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.276478643311	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.248761989613	Check it out.
0.0	0.570360505376	We're up 347,000 jobs.

0.0	0.191967290778	Maria...
0.0	0.264377763336	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
1.0	0.868463741106	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.302547841313	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.571018450506	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.370783325224	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.32749917949	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.169268796676	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.331587521616	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.

0.0	0.153670155278	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.136058110382	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.360938580628	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.566142495543	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.452826188885	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.185061813533	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.5	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.531608734546	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.233507942188	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.202977362237	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.789420875627	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.454852331679	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.865750543831	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.198342295495	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.446365557554	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.635540208757	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.199418277935	I totally get that.
0.0	0.350254162045	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.593050709909	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.484637838615	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.185249508376	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.247759399032	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.431667664632	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.303095998452	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.209948696362	And for good cause.
0.0	0.548120558414	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.285818541714	That is not right.
0.0	0.255716326058	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.216406228883	No, it should be repealed.
1.0	0.720448986759	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.408131307321	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.769765034075	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.25116311395	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.609441146779	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.0388374289889	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.468979014919	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.789615755164	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.475287639757	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.572469463118	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.255513064815	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.267147572522	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.578103210138	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.235795889413	That's good.
0.0	0.240537424049	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.866077180385	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.217753561557	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.0544139818424	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.273495920042	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.271861680984	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.522503073521	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.817987647829	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.32168074612	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.104264952937	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.387206392788	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.763356773898	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.117589818346	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.322282366349	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.151792379363	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.37992293438	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.407786159091	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.149427867548	I'd consider it.
1.0	0.668432558886	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
1.0	0.83110296143	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.278838169921	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.515654443808	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.235535619544	The number of women --
0.0	0.146322899426	You looking at me?
0.0	0.716100454686	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.490254992495	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.692636586289	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
1.0	0.149001183927	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.231288204323	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.493541077236	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.294211866958	I will be that new leader.
1.0	0.258259640274	This president is undermining our military.
1.0	0.837887045176	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.282674899319	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.57959467302	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.258544278594	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.748966829761	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.662437825361	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.26368904044	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.156762108696	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.423488433767	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.511721118936	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.240451072255	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.14450619823	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.345883001725	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.299291252028	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
1.0	0.870513297013	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.5	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.297074428427	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.314018836232	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.272185774344	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.5	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.577853887104	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.518823003876	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.320620690471	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.766452068345	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.46519504043	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.196888343753	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.303151399262	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.144085163354	You just want to...
0.0	0.297804919659	On welfare.
0.0	0.267483027146	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.400801095202	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.805091318676	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.620296331601	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.171459623397	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.571966816783	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.353596147537	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.23000107618	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.919557976412	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.138817812808	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.65504388727	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.342263045241	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.228513987859	No, John.
0.0	0.24051930357	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.5	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.261412141349	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.885005461817	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
1.0	0.588102332131	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.308022961441	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.83366297887	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.173724765081	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.252578954841	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.366221961506	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.150588622787	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.145288342089	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.305747725598	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.732854090918	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.731213535675	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.783661779403	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.286819624611	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.149962594073	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.321920382487	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.476048498453	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.695767539194	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.189990589465	Yes.
0.0	0.465134610906	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.346318707501	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.198505817145	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.276803139545	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.646204696254	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.317038907761	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.538024995547	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.133712178361	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.600796707062	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.545416912035	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.241245553945	John.
0.0	0.35112781672	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.308858008324	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.39184445473	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.183063127684	You know why?
0.0	0.718900974239	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.259468466183	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.0658569833653	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.664658199469	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.251550817439	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.316602887603	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.507309557824	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.51537014828	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.

0.0	0.304097238122	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.0177090082311	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.

0.0	0.307183599998	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.277129124801	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.

0.0	0.368088805664	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.776662801137	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.626476793188	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.

0.0	0.372414566103	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.195606797117	Nobody can deny them.

0.0	0.5	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.638144312739	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.216197713112	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.229864109771	It never happens.
0.0	0.724789923753	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.590144984188	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.414837442906	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.659406562098	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.267757305447	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.106289889166	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.64789119677	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.361913734782	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.199726891883	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.314569053453	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.820759625846	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.321304610334	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.913562173114	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.117847454632	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.622120679388	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.232328179371	Absolutely.
0.0	0.718801719746	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.378620991143	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.232909025839	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.450480168607	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.648765677583	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.477177613158	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.258939625283	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
1.0	0.798226307237	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.148501912679	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.485365663191	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.149781109934	It feels different.
0.0	0.457043182653	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.708959127713	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.189991953373	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.262506982061	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.374610402079	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.371599039848	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.795437061575	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.212545517857	You're welcome.
0.0	0.348918808995	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.529436690079	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.147201713259	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.719953407595	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.351058213418	I was the architect.
0.0	0.461412491735	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.509507130149	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.285068112654	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.370856551157	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.557214348791	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.357411668501	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.801273459868	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.161162488871	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.722304788254	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.40923375964	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.352357236253	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.0924752397114	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0413191956352	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
1.0	0.363891117211	They were wrong.
0.0	0.302790163997	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.241178970731	I win.
0.0	0.87322944622	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.266115755583	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.549144593533	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.389028928221	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.311913100551	You did.
0.0	0.143787613427	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.416232675853	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.0354862565291	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
1.0	0.306131929964	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.0721280220042	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.0433040810654	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.36808750583	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.18693549093	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.145899853312	Why?
0.0	0.425421579947	Just for the record.
0.0	0.251158033756	The answer is no.
0.0	0.429228005082	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.756946351152	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.202517499097	He's wrong.
0.0	0.508287848713	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.351091279889	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.238966251849	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.260520633919	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.278670448308	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.363473045066	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.760962048833	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.0653181184303	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.177259906317	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.224061732731	And, we said no.
0.0	0.562638060321	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.281207253977	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.832555204621	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.413127867271	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.371127653579	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.309099761775	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.553008903678	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.362052771903	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.553463563462	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.142193865362	I would just say that...
0.0	0.303149789382	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.511469842937	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.338660768854	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.352675736079	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.151345005872	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.380081987289	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.282105063298	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.350224818655	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.479008213063	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.252864348166	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.329503629097	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
1.0	0.763040123958	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.515945478971	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.343197958705	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.276674225777	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.303823533319	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
1.0	0.33726573952	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.360310106594	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.317760139904	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.342613748744	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.305766395195	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
