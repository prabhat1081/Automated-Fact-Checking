0.0	0.213596760383	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.794580086962	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.233800238131	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.197821567934	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.19316172081	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.45740902065	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.29923119241	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.196930544916	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.182121830659	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.5	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.594916360203	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.300865193207	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.727553905442	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.37773383088	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.278086894765	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.370489936122	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.708346648197	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.646322536631	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.688251160681	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.408691173963	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.185110944337	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.908465614751	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.253165726834	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.261293332574	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.530340692175	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.610504231551	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.300857645635	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.169434365511	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.274176398189	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.434408070525	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.206963267443	No.
1.0	0.773207702916	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.346323005886	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.583199189745	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.80172951438	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.348458517615	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.759943245788	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.076667596283	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.140004820456	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.33760237473	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.716311330356	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.21939578377	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.176230452617	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.275796923247	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.38269605587	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.995157734765	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.118793057545	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.120410086095	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.217918403034	You really can't.
0.0	0.767470109554	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.231892639785	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.242807101653	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.361302917501	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.297858021639	But here's the real key.
1.0	0.842416565815	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.447797463829	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.218450389676	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.234121474623	Divide that out.
0.0	0.895749868014	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.176458580417	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.352363366869	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.531484498039	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.121640031186	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.778973917427	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.511971357386	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.280784986887	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.685387918756	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.431575941309	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.390289682559	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.205204295861	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.212946764506	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.142209557584	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.227999801267	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.550800149389	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.300056303129	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.775012505951	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.263961378752	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.254267456565	In addition to that...
0.0	0.591167870679	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
1.0	0.401955236902	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.579426081045	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.573905638394	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.307117246543	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.699123827132	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.35062596865	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.15456871905	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.535486051769	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.184257473605	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.140339662943	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.578785625337	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
1.0	0.377073814693	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.184070706106	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.323154314487	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.205245196072	We're running.
0.0	0.543113559256	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.298344469986	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.233189816257	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.470806244326	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.217724917449	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.222517339596	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.48691840671	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.297298123962	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.318640130855	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.100518946533	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.239399691145	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.193963804651	Yes.
0.0	0.214018571799	I can't do it.
0.0	0.470463447765	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.521420972306	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.560788309336	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.209073652333	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.299748898993	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.8786931172	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.277922338374	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.101421222577	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.545466919915	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.17908993866	And God bless America.
0.0	0.146564481885	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.262108839631	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.836640553314	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.387835894519	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.246661069189	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.372579915336	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.193758117826	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.286332509179	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.919571375371	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.371063802128	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.799967171529	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.664771438027	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.267204725758	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.335643662793	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.50668680247	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.902308626839	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.88621673625	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.140944784556	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.720547612925	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.277331273641	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.217980519279	You do.
0.0	0.598196590051	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.508113605735	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.413361236157	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.930940979733	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.678866007697	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.402196701064	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.585566982422	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.395681052111	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.554794524666	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.343921840997	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.208555114136	We have to obey the laws.
1.0	0.321291814693	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.169180583628	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.113158684789	And guess what?
0.0	0.888374243548	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.309794389336	We actually did it.
0.0	0.753392815036	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.292624515226	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.530110775039	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.205203827432	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.238452276703	It never happens.
0.0	0.903626034751	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
1.0	0.958337152372	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.342161273427	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.533624769254	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.600580386663	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.462981459742	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.558763839891	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.195396313769	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.717403012962	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.367790989107	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.320712105834	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.167775831272	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.261217654687	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.171948710339	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.152098197841	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.199026196794	You know that.
0.0	0.247754677002	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.22964406384	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.565293775891	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.227712395672	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.982640903507	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.306089307854	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.759174406124	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.221460398336	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.17146101426	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.388283221231	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.257023833981	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.146579782818	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.308945254567	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.547246133753	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.188204478993	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.241944615684	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.375740290078	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.24572764049	That's not right.
0.0	0.265417314751	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.441189948713	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.257624215389	You get together.
0.0	0.260821377372	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.154363784277	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.5	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.344143623551	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.608232599543	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.31754871309	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.485057187507	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.334445729999	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.349683840091	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.167057499656	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.33299538971	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.295907851568	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.353498281157	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.183260683346	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.232972384529	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.413243091709	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.250652913179	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.250895951535	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.0639857752302	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.161027636399	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.141269515118	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.149430604473	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.280218427701	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.243933812436	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.270209518611	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.8635287844	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.837707981847	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.253873917949	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.768801536296	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.122069122919	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.63763064324	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.674999123475	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.313617450748	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.288496041879	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
1.0	0.356577219288	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.794004978529	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.351874846297	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.265898904905	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.702552040988	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
1.0	0.591499524386	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.142429760687	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.266420963136	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.697769918133	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.525551596054	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
1.0	0.928898713978	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.92255949529	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.156571511894	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.268247442947	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.333171801755	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.312937634242	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.58091325042	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.214559872318	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.298699031703	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.394861005434	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.241125328585	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.484407917222	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.403290312946	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.721213937206	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
1.0	0.170689251022	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.42127562577	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.305357468716	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.453830698546	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.145731349828	How great is that?
0.0	0.884566678314	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.642695771562	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.225714646674	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.400091778725	He hit oil.
0.0	0.739395077542	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.455641563555	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.912312636832	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.284037321671	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.452788554925	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.202877415757	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.246449770998	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.439850631363	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.646117047551	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.225414390612	Right.
0.0	0.0815174384242	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.54967449606	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.23033378105	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.575404776094	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.386616059616	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.279001203069	This is 2016.
0.0	0.197841495207	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.0683266459679	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.672292769872	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.39680685567	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.270649878698	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.398452202596	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.686173492556	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.447868099116	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.405108712403	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.263413819459	She said the truth.
0.0	0.548493588692	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.259346110118	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.337196018626	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.172618634154	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.313579479609	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.381363001357	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.138038797894	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.388873384543	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.463814065103	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.213718154733	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.400770810552	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.454972386046	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.237959628668	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.26813102491	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.332167310246	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.227211472365	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.291145406894	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.187566275965	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.359040481518	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.286674554116	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.595436459798	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.308662242226	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.468527827445	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.676749387458	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.150434638633	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.733522882521	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.655258178878	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.135342062871	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.491180599192	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.481779991513	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.561113968157	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.193963804651	Yes.
0.0	0.243392714884	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.285258844385	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.239383892542	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.429402380981	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.308557369432	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.561838020971	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.208207156058	in particular.
0.0	0.468830073748	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.556629422801	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.178966295984	You know why?
0.0	0.418430129528	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.372120705543	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.284087141766	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.177242237753	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.356944523498	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.276828481406	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.196464440367	That's for sure.
0.0	0.389317279275	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.0844080930719	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.183137082055	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.674230062221	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.379210408342	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.1461570634	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.788241978561	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.206963267443	No.
0.0	0.290089785339	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.5	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.256859343008	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.309005288149	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.418455382154	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.654210631697	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.602562918832	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.589016798584	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.235154825608	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.479456438659	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.165770127333	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.475543838379	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.206826939361	Think about that.
0.0	0.938401911178	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
1.0	0.811515282508	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.32177708676	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.317373701275	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.430282500742	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.206963267443	No.
0.0	0.380963983002	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.182097827398	And you know what?
0.0	0.92929125562	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.702714051466	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.257848630966	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.515104752123	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.361218135916	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.595157551998	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.485825026154	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.344773013714	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.164804807288	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.452706247964	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.242550575164	Creativity.
0.0	0.569830445917	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.379482626205	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.536925826391	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.263313273237	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.572451862015	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.363923167163	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.153180492083	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.352382841833	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.362035168597	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.383319284147	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.152428029784	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.535388044097	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.927740111326	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.253338659549	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.655920239203	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.471080015224	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.205452281946	I'm aware of that.
1.0	0.921991331909	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.347260860512	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.355387904594	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.356608333044	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.36107163005	I didn't find it offensive at all.
1.0	0.699942735609	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.390544369328	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.419785326312	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.184314877754	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.338819251294	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.214107426821	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.35741577561	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.227481045171	Check it out.
0.0	0.240729335287	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.265219269233	Came out great.
0.0	0.303906987953	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.707530976591	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.30503175576	That never works.
0.0	0.201554623369	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.179512079393	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.505878514665	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.253704502445	About Medicare?
0.0	0.381116304292	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.282035087455	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.25659085034	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.122077145765	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.0633922502948	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.159407270053	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.0969688242816	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.31611790917	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.546735087535	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.132578140512	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.547038878196	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.175954362881	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.331247359367	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.214145192859	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.407244066685	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.591443473105	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.622218688419	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.625510507096	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.254489323537	Our next president...
0.0	0.49470549804	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.536752996299	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.40875746954	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.82415840341	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.305584572668	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.379932952684	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.476824622613	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.348303767169	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.168230678539	Why is that?
0.0	0.292077579602	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.844686721795	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.686210328346	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.949756970129	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.658726727104	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
1.0	0.827455118162	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.269977799384	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.490905415179	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.605918273742	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.36030512984	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.198554655694	I don't care.
0.0	0.332225735003	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.163647518057	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.251172813475	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.626590830896	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.561766505561	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.350462324399	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.334126690356	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.538040253814	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.250443387251	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.14792181291	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.955671997576	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.405568160612	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.302124911469	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.391437894332	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.753299216507	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.354710543549	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.0819923071293	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.279340919319	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.437214743383	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.267664746694	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.782563672652	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.247936504273	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.388343388958	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.934456744749	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.564625728369	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.693822199592	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.470428792282	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
1.0	0.646349327173	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.126722358953	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.157636777503	How do I know this?
0.0	0.16993548383	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.490844237465	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.249089096524	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.317797551362	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.514520046837	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.544596538378	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.14698123668	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.139612289816	I understand.
0.0	0.124996502454	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.615765195928	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.206963267443	No.
1.0	0.333912742959	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.275622213653	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.480901824113	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.269262430616	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.695715632657	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.139290351133	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.962633709664	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.438079880783	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.246882051835	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.252336718553	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.933980994883	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.834643195173	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.187856564181	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.215184312952	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.308732881515	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
1.0	0.86779176069	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.431107514444	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.273340796184	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.427174360088	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.804940079385	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.292378843461	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.298979114951	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.402345066556	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.169280718328	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.758162956446	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.194890605521	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.219335049827	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.0947534520735	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.505775279582	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.683193003378	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.546260181924	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.319152477835	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.545584125628	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.559408673653	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.334984277697	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.173928843304	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.27008112729	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.527137833782	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.546700203741	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.273115086356	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.212409212311	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.828475873839	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.390302384703	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.382212088278	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.174880805983	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.55177034486	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.518333227343	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.101934166323	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.410861991731	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.557106485025	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.170541886634	Well, sure.
0.0	0.525615636241	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.779152566669	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.554990678667	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.651552313921	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.0972305502865	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.612510692154	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.195672397668	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.679529436558	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.166760228173	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.310231172082	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.221574919928	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.295951354305	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.456273555954	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.647712212441	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.270285919202	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.298751283941	I got that.
0.0	0.158759643142	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.210556415335	It's a joke.
0.0	0.242097045246	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.330850274592	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.544266429567	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.224580211191	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.31721085566	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.249739539122	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.145361109044	I like that.
0.0	0.789894055559	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.137183817988	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.240726963955	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.629814970759	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.583948775569	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.915691636759	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.64491742268	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.470008713423	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.268451019355	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.873681023461	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.525418282925	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.230885886884	Not bad.
0.0	0.59888168019	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.811851821182	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.638811134582	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.577078756025	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.814830973732	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.175887163443	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.366949223255	They're sick of politics as usual.
1.0	0.538352942442	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.864574333615	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.238573848064	You don't have to.
0.0	0.37246968819	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.226586751575	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.2518249271	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.426063667583	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.478650876551	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
1.0	0.572046255965	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.432238453149	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.420016028926	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.962761194972	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.295082289458	You know why three?
0.0	0.3531780854	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.198930528942	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.372035031901	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.280776346709	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.217288828254	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.607657843689	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.5	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.430990766312	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.801838922911	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.193963804651	Yes.
0.0	0.644083073052	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.300795590976	It was.
0.0	0.102586286002	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.351560933067	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.354615413529	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.730436750467	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.253165223556	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.217535985959	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.66101130255	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.316770510122	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.0916365355589	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.235984894524	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.1479285416	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.29361871665	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.295929744185	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.372648438427	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.245589041397	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.176747648866	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.470643056791	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.180174797166	I'll say this.
0.0	0.925557806171	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.236612110126	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.489416584453	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.489031479833	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.378026183787	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.201556945194	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.0683304454206	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.208378612651	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.917704651352	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.0628395112143	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.165772314202	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.481703745397	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.659359047802	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.343630558376	But I was born here.
0.0	0.480922812746	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.396125892357	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.24817577075	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.556790200122	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.285568662398	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.591999688596	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.480713768427	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.0368557711566	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.157737561628	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.339623363831	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.200869247386	It is.
0.0	0.841888806844	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.897194298152	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.368041269975	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.533078107965	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.875246859182	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.242384020274	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.429540138068	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.279239216484	We were wrong.
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.0779534373245	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.297824946999	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.550146000863	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.364839519799	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.445458303924	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.216838878343	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.702909986499	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.24378702998	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.214018571799	We can't do it.
0.0	0.172239724895	I think he is right.
0.0	0.154428848476	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.197497369511	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.0536907764877	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.740023646564	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.0464399781555	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.234386798696	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.631029469755	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.204810965487	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.273029206454	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
1.0	0.924927731926	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.237407383918	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.221651962707	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.190272130579	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.78217363601	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.410207378315	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.437943045953	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.306603549788	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.153858685268	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.310470313684	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.188183668167	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.182097827398	But you know what?
0.0	0.149439446539	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
1.0	0.327879139754	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.700264193988	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.29637417384	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.140396797422	It's true.
0.0	0.203494309154	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.443196144715	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.161314528344	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.216854487472	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.341847556516	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.742967958448	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.56305518023	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.783341595453	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.452574345941	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.185239603242	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.30113791441	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.565140685908	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.20415637386	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.229878776751	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.624170524415	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.239364115386	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.247664180833	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.175059669318	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.186816753959	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.111654292863	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.278551150969	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.321109336178	He is a good man.
0.0	0.267580643688	That has not been...
0.0	0.257061585021	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.445792089976	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.641370169683	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.401172159713	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.5	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.232360366471	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.43178132284	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.518627321597	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.706363135763	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.321646956055	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.155895874175	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.568870470067	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.173107404537	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.976666939249	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.249066222179	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.218105885892	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.434930239469	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.558042358464	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.864705038619	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.513587510095	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.63215467949	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.5	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.257423728107	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.241588595942	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.166589893893	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.518599036289	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.510366607761	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.23477834684	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.667425684637	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.436396708218	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.524848505482	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.104235145815	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.402793310058	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.622073931683	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.454530761757	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.666958315372	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.5	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.403097989175	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.461001766953	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.488882422842	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.831797673996	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.779078439328	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.21444220759	That will change everything.
0.0	0.5	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.107026273954	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.0756934725053	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.202125507696	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.212807637158	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.450027569332	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.346444339988	I never said that.
0.0	0.449423901862	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.296311786306	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.

0.0	0.286633097331	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.193744455272	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.853356658594	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.211801388634	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.302086497621	That's fine.
0.0	0.408061094985	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.329195439657	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.541720845229	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.314220420915	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.23170020075	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.105523648282	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.3943730989	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.

0.0	0.814014842277	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.857208813407	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.362566611986	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.351363342071	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.77481697822	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.427895892689	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.230644813008	They cause dishonesty.
1.0	0.664181887408	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.292378077451	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.555973625695	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.199064621286	You find me...
0.0	0.438055229783	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.330335539914	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.507650122625	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.465974167132	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.529896962372	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.163919286883	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.289255983649	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.366618235032	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.333778552416	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.386758238116	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.345841332574	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.390820951701	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.490668546731	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.79768374857	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.574645993733	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.42493526357	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.625837015913	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.661319653918	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.756450294443	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.618114766198	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.217980519279	I do.
0.0	0.624391615927	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.330730399314	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.118199387868	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.104718872509	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.797986959474	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.22353335098	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.299003161016	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.802018117979	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.645700244904	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.770408000901	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.4882311937	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.191453655693	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.597199814623	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.29023824346	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.330251469565	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.616954881072	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.392914698463	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.811911060805	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.54659251449	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.39799340537	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.217206115571	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.162161699629	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.398804354735	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.376281336008	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.39036489084	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.250867989386	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.276597241508	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.25307487335	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.236940201461	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.374325634302	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.16807005587	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.288544001912	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.409950084968	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.0939987759083	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.584386504446	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.181707414617	That is...
0.0	0.274867341589	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.178175543684	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.210050145379	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.114766796726	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.39964009797	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.116698910279	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.245495920762	We're not doing it.
1.0	0.513563799512	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.709402342696	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.786718847971	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.310640883798	Good at email.
0.0	0.445477819902	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.870803822094	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.542959735115	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.392642524874	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.53705697777	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.130547711674	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.347321015184	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.222434066157	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.160233648197	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.928193350617	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.26234119049	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.398097891175	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.232487736719	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.132444986278	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.314588956033	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.214878999732	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.20085733936	Think about it.
0.0	0.206963267443	No.
0.0	0.200238290855	...
0.0	0.5	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.430172639533	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.358604438185	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.378146940885	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.336031586069	He got lucky with fracking.
1.0	0.921929543303	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.5	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.331700260981	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.319088633905	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.447183189432	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.371776147655	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.880718073717	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.192054875721	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.19578724482	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.312959640993	I know every one.
0.0	0.303001380368	That's the difference.
0.0	0.94924600258	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.615476479323	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.182097827398	And you know what?
0.0	0.232862615328	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.33655160542	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.166750499647	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.303587043607	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.87115840052	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.163266704909	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.599870863799	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.194888053186	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.229464173466	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.654796991969	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.164111378224	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.978331661871	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.85340950217	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.282553826107	I've done it.
0.0	0.682338718003	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.558808735103	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.163621638457	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.423957521557	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.28226671334	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.691091647396	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.371332414548	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.211674823948	You bet they do.
0.0	0.196331800207	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.392539921387	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.533153804834	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.641063651811	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.272021174019	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.707832190806	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
1.0	0.567756400541	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.248850669769	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.433270052868	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.29094468483	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.770394632821	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.453483787445	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.378783298796	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.478530829337	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.57087906021	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.272564613706	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.215937604694	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.081770078724	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.28066649616	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.417625307276	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.393095432185	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.0973080548362	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.523842512686	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.172635003396	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.951148795159	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.759174406124	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
1.0	0.365471719419	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.154946908738	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.38022118337	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.110795060882	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.173238558986	I want security.
0.0	0.420263640683	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.3192071596	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.407741395221	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.168854870539	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.364789578329	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.33648434457	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.

0.0	0.138213606155	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.0155656954355	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.343779267618	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.28742984402	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.28928118216	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.738923905737	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.312134340268	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.637742949837	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.353412738124	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.475368040462	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.625936863087	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.

0.0	0.489292190872	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.5	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.778890493485	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.222580935797	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.344897878568	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.642199930072	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.271568743172	They understand that there's a national security risk.

0.0	0.296436513267	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.134704312792	But...
0.0	0.272420836215	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.413340779815	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.893346042883	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.505395265969	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.337914063753	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.

0.0	0.404237880305	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.240970130214	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.336234540684	I changed that.
0.0	0.489382974637	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.368386292019	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.520574803547	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.287613017356	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.368953519891	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.225414390612	Ever.
0.0	0.431708022827	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.

0.0	0.429682944917	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.374379444796	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.374931986767	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.206963267443	No.
0.0	0.473845588212	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.696434424896	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.

0.0	0.425290647748	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.360843930415	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.886919985715	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.185450032386	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.194387093604	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.49071516415	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.270383870596	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.322769169952	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.308451988742	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.203494309154	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.152252577735	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.24988122254	That's not true.
0.0	0.275844790112	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.229313338576	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.103316426904	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.019900004708	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.518173451245	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.235087738727	I believe we are on the path to doing that.

0.0	0.276156100819	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.145379487952	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.483933706111	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.210720648035	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.2402292112	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.234840489583	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.168387200204	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.329712966819	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.615576213467	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.329568516696	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.221527883868	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.289235930101	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.739837673677	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.744889100967	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.243068356836	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.27653810865	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.322589427536	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.267826136883	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.19841100818	So...
0.0	0.724421431217	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.427827462876	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.346342957285	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.405367670163	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.494590525568	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.5132320874	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.292640352132	I have no idea.
0.0	0.226619180368	We don't win.
0.0	0.375425888623	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.433453723576	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.194190016492	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.366832706257	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.84615484608	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.700971118155	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.422879645075	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.647903767256	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.58395936959	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.458377498469	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.443782716323	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.174484432961	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.197793028842	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.375380330992	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.751102820173	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.252302004284	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.426063667583	It's driving up stock prices.
1.0	0.283118533607	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.608241102202	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
1.0	0.581074168206	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.378253900249	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.327355125341	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.311378509806	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.290054945236	Do we still have standards?
1.0	0.313751544829	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.2413844645	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.921832141201	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.319923495326	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.133453339775	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.5	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.334708104902	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.849567404166	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.231922838868	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
1.0	0.597621475042	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.209829687064	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.752496294083	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.0957799170192	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.147960184085	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.879859847319	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
1.0	0.976595818931	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.287076324352	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.348155243946	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.133397782944	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.581317734494	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
1.0	0.691684010194	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.181918215087	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.279232017562	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.727929716146	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.232138637166	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.330436932106	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.210607205655	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.441854284049	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.458793110757	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.197788476056	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.585570156845	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.601748615172	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.288815462136	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.950946569598	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.0699805632057	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.756413538509	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.232469823858	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.791121491513	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.748026825783	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.132109023624	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.121695501673	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.509515415782	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.444486277947	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.317334841502	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.269053769168	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.282316975755	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.289418989324	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.

0.0	0.740752152045	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
1.0	0.785611341033	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.27064428371	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.308467280181	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.459214269787	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.97796558827	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.37755283353	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.322496076645	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.403231271732	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.481980564651	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.136444824636	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.298657235378	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.423615379794	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.274681577147	My background is different.

0.0	0.85149185722	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.39701132309	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
1.0	0.894338245532	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.

0.0	0.263705137393	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.5341027041	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.224102010997	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.777632523608	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.299335974889	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
1.0	0.765390222556	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.

0.0	0.313271144211	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.374798966038	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.439390830724	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
1.0	0.18464061736	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.566376513708	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.5	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.307708752974	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.218199564128	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.

0.0	0.193963804651	OK?

0.0	0.628939602657	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.315399640241	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.960423750729	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.241602170934	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.215309354345	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.460526069063	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.

1.0	0.952789671501	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.153775106355	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.418070589659	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.218967568648	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.355728006377	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.196123216395	OK, good.
0.0	0.284088279879	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.311740303667	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.407173404385	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.265545727462	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.474252481787	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.777501624504	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.0529675560017	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.199137741707	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.220536707499	So you know what?
0.0	0.205672473614	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.361405420248	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.526945589964	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.283154115395	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.0750408069876	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.551973114332	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.510736027196	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.3854557685	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.608342578665	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.156590427036	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.129986016339	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.465945946589	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.235748662829	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.232388615583	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.523961222858	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
1.0	0.98766725062	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.380135520213	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.217980519279	We do.
0.0	0.46821899722	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.23753069249	It's their money.
0.0	0.182097827398	And you know what?
0.0	0.193367747784	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.421138914182	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.739225059108	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.45870328514	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.424721953632	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.188041110177	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.101707087673	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.144314426913	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.544514777512	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.630122369168	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.644548275906	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.281980540374	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.0476303617444	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.665917878608	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.214257881551	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.953969928502	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.146674280024	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.330472749004	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.334083861118	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.10844270688	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.232872590509	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.515799435984	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.480052656328	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.800686819568	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.172331995653	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.274026186398	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.370438816687	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.766175631051	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.347142879958	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.3916127535	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.467414966359	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.13374641212	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.479283871923	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.236658588592	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.176782432709	...Chris...
0.0	0.240622662723	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.353431158935	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.518814157661	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.44098748005	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.327844651167	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.529839158652	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.403856719492	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.655619903688	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.273281243846	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.198508675656	And our economy was growing like crazy.
1.0	0.73900022937	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.233797025411	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.314301343233	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.13033582949	No, it's true.
0.0	0.5211590008	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.0888926349477	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.530767419411	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.455290125933	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.604707775492	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.276778928043	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.300106966602	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.

0.0	0.672517803711	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.237180879656	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.205896407156	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.546353871992	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.273171825777	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.

0.0	0.184869571677	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.074896015229	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.0950249236151	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.

0.0	0.369968700823	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.410907861253	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.454152404704	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.266140053936	I have fully endorsed those.

0.0	0.425867025407	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.345893237666	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
1.0	0.351123248197	Very few children.
0.0	0.277225072454	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.399443633801	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.86383554625	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.397299829488	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.63945528206	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.371740031533	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.780140399882	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.236659722206	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.29371726813	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.257599625506	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.186328003084	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.206152458627	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.323509346456	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.2632795697	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.291825992977	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.609747695417	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.583775278044	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0717886406358	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.824398762438	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.0703512923701	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.42588388309	He was on the board.
0.0	0.152861037486	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.370059138025	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.301832603391	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.767493134727	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.918725299134	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.769866402107	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.195946820933	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.213634864378	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.345886083591	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.11898843525	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.332093854296	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.201082160667	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.372994713322	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.222034816044	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.24572764049	That's not right.
0.0	0.566601307053	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.257624215389	You're right.
0.0	0.604852282741	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.194515163136	No, no.
0.0	0.76188649345	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.524053745708	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.295834135677	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.776427416045	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.205946212651	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.422664120981	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.355228684588	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.0211445649809	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.374869944851	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.141978948107	But I would add this.
0.0	0.167529685193	This will end.
0.0	0.659062952332	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.794269134956	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.348102797885	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.24931467553	That's right.
0.0	0.774668603533	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.800349940011	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.205706355854	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.564266058099	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.853402752034	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.957947519805	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.411195349757	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.384862927488	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.73965799234	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.44475691848	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.198432975638	And so do I.
0.0	0.0544899140591	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.288454143706	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.194150820705	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.214853753262	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.773408550786	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.773652876682	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.157689317562	...Thank you.
0.0	0.234473730355	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.432178620187	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.893039903265	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.511567519309	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.204231608824	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.236181708178	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
1.0	0.319808096004	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.241033129484	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.223983550046	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.149732210417	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.224735875008	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.183524553816	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.267893864921	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.102405737602	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.17049494388	That's my view.
0.0	0.367645105709	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.949852590599	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
1.0	0.747029176924	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.718770863357	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.702939764031	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.364145058627	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.729015491049	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.285811465076	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.637521615977	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.291389145679	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.147593235153	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.129096304157	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.591440813622	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.245872674238	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.38575481651	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.238644726536	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.559934915556	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.571577253057	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.359395648111	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.695329981612	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.383411988903	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.358828101559	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.648354571438	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.428016206084	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.373384290675	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.473002086532	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
1.0	0.632451849471	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.513665848545	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.318790155684	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.833779251897	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.281766733342	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.380194509716	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.342684866164	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.730954719441	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.308318378165	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.676570507737	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.155638959201	What should we do?
0.0	0.579874904685	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.309801790971	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.376817853512	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.248621756371	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.257501208846	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.278411503568	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.193963804651	OK.
0.0	0.46585915839	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.204625992002	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.149234927606	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.384919230532	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.292898856706	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.848010737106	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.528672661484	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.193963804651	OK?
0.0	0.287231172531	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.228785056766	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.377522340848	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.223455934972	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.315620156859	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.255125895508	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.385682860602	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.426120241115	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.266610777508	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.794320021698	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.314605506446	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.382120217465	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.170004570094	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.527943500437	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.182097827398	And you know what?
0.0	0.347241907174	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.346444339988	I never said that.
0.0	0.477444609223	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.53441682903	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.391297619952	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.202055105555	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.404267129521	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.244515355159	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.257902932847	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.242942702773	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.88712257546	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.328305250157	A brief response.
0.0	0.632987438698	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.566419082034	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.351388937992	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.64903625031	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.348333228115	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.545394247031	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.178921423933	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.809456225105	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.770731796096	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.252780164755	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.5	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.351889722669	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.259300300705	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.581811760703	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.349130402	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.139715050051	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.525725181385	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.215725823048	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.147619980912	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.286939055628	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.338115073676	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.109322304289	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.0798845508318	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.397723918653	I was not at all.
0.0	0.312711631612	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.231001695029	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.573350438419	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.21296149711	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.216187113623	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.136763523093	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.694486524817	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.464059464726	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.322265327353	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.412059209546	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.281515503048	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.492697890265	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.307953890653	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.553289304639	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.223002952221	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.111720942816	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.125656924268	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.169683915868	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.0650899615529	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.26951330834	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.703460384434	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.422565334081	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.337771967001	I said no.
0.0	0.873887658886	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.763978368846	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.673954574256	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.778594745711	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.432536418898	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.437137435588	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.377279349399	The world has changed.
0.0	0.271661117895	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.467502539074	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.204040503179	I promise.
0.0	0.379343033644	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.694224749181	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.547633715356	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.235028254198	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.293319043742	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.621769101623	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.531058882878	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.657354121252	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.250602951048	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.0999456564032	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.225935472269	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.449578166434	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.344324533037	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.285662516617	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.459024202452	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.234730554676	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.436500139564	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.239220868589	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.22750983601	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
1.0	0.709035073612	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.475556547129	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.282620776268	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.259254976878	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.22439395221	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.660979277639	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.916052430472	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.312967919203	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.558082592292	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.455429080588	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.772817579711	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.706926384444	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.174378359104	We don't need that.
0.0	0.371347777047	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.164340790798	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.733958336066	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.311269456897	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.22863224803	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.0286022772511	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.558439634069	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.54640629957	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.124205033706	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.34062021734	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.103504060165	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.167169346054	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.438787216764	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.1215704769	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.487507958987	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.988006260405	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.450944385194	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.55681573577	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.667636416939	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.25428631023	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.366543919084	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.577748900659	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.286004062535	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.605876471241	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.512884255755	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.650858287465	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.56540434134	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.091214401497	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.0816947791452	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.241211956247	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.174216808516	See?
0.0	0.240630250005	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.374187013757	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.197415250325	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.581597248716	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.85953548787	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.158043031395	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.754854838111	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.208548762802	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.12668931686	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.259731544691	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.376741823746	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.405015255586	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.54751879332	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.386421172756	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.293253876355	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
1.0	0.638885167595	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.627204657007	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.207035431377	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.538701607826	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.5	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.25052150333	You do the arithmetic.
1.0	0.196650032829	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.445021837221	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.368761058502	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.358953841238	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.457705682286	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.139455434722	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.188095559118	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.845502144573	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.820065640297	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.273591967036	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.441967542425	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.259361580925	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.467449291755	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.388806511078	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.246554616358	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.163295533809	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.363381268464	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.368470552567	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.432888899845	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.558783579591	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.0609012063906	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.647946685642	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.205146789583	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.4330232008	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.243570801524	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.729636034444	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.311321535884	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.229375574522	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.448770038926	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.746380440255	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.453555393943	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.386306495535	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.533980021317	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.304372975597	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.345257128678	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.553789844405	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.108672733498	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.176766624723	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.666353383017	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.176782432709	...John...
0.0	0.044005430405	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.195008803852	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.445377684663	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.413191161545	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.311606367245	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.197647404523	We need security.
0.0	0.131798324112	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
1.0	0.849307411923	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.199145745033	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.269844262463	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.388206965062	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.148649427219	And here's why.
0.0	0.319628166008	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.187775056975	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.390677230266	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.779864473488	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.405762239045	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.364651555962	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.454820865781	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.668508429544	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.491238024939	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.650091025685	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.189056577758	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.738463598804	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.409740884504	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.209349946814	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.3897673696	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.155798711408	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.257174098037	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.352626524244	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.357485944087	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.210623064775	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.467530778989	We're a country of laws, Bill.

1.0	0.52506575213	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.0481359510954	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.345748111517	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.169414724418	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.311175442513	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.237226852668	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.253936644902	Let's talk about our campaigns.
1.0	0.79979577345	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.368443801974	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.438093494815	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.710159078333	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.365420720565	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.217277461366	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.506566556926	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.320313850015	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.379380251954	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.722536393512	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.238144257039	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.181639691723	These...
0.0	0.363365993196	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.5	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.727518307167	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.206963267443	No.
0.0	0.182250321403	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.22296551719	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.650176653587	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.282406418793	I've laid out...
0.0	0.590043624719	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.267965990296	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.440648948819	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.257182570342	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.208357343352	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.345450500869	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.329685112775	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.318892267469	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.200783640186	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.289989619307	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.350247823321	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.271104373747	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.263091876395	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.315344833526	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.346164755011	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.507838690759	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.263582925697	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.278295081852	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.338632853981	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.377489415658	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.717680687756	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.529769141608	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.393483501601	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.677308454346	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.829628680741	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.781105675366	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.225414390612	Absolutely.
0.0	0.200508673269	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.439071351179	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.252373142995	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.236784603449	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.233645765134	That's why I ask for your support for president.
1.0	0.49461785826	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.492508088865	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.222846031879	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.737043552421	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.0903511515158	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.756582761779	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.338166828174	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.273840754587	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.216062223618	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.388187845001	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.485299138209	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.321133446618	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.104836340075	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.187187777764	We need sound money.
0.0	0.224511586694	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.284902604377	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.398787866082	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.142847543415	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.319162505781	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.5	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.137322745473	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.394815404429	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.241186275652	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.225254184672	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.366166392417	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.228376891073	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.293760698588	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.38510146469	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.514416243968	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.278729218988	...income tax...
0.0	0.293410784662	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
1.0	0.186213131802	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.364427644467	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.387201634169	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.308705820663	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.75632259716	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.172331995653	But if you look at working men and women.
1.0	0.69651925582	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.171720588221	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.245495920762	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.265801237076	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.436289313662	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.106777316677	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.351889877118	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.304235016939	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.368109289241	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.5	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.12411834571	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.791684065526	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.579639088077	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.15376735511	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.270595476637	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.0658122618196	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.181985634849	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.464453201636	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.761322090361	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.139304673143	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.484492737909	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.

0.0	0.591132178559	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.182097827398	And you know what?
0.0	0.5	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.766222651404	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.569703176479	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.519417744427	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.492109472349	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.66129027095	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.287795661265	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.152724729273	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.193963804651	Yeah.
0.0	0.5676047991	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.519811488941	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.253849842502	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.551611569853	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.398058724882	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.202645289903	He's wrong.
0.0	0.429271919088	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.0839687559466	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.336478084328	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.458238957487	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.253352193521	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.137543600648	And why?
0.0	0.784273344801	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.360388506316	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.377387390731	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.516599605242	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.0598905314078	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.307568496674	They're a scam.
0.0	0.596868489015	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.705683428031	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.126851387228	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.418801799008	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.196480918854	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.333683773284	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.225414390612	Right.
0.0	0.210957093456	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.19206691364	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.710955550742	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.433063026302	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.188234770046	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.530378386182	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.352244257781	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.487231545285	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.321784322586	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.191503286449	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.306100147319	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.535609103476	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.64871538009	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.278562256789	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.137185766422	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.827455118162	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.321794831384	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
1.0	0.714932821701	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.200983816055	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.15686065618	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.69139751048	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
1.0	0.819472965067	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.395432115832	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.233533828596	John?
0.0	0.715544086174	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.138659968896	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.328336883444	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.250263795334	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.22142910037	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.377298443371	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.155691545779	But look...
0.0	0.349929106824	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.604996356661	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.216811672828	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.298304401203	You're simply not.
0.0	0.346098805426	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.338732773973	That's what I said.
0.0	0.219582553351	That's what he is.
0.0	0.232838030632	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.23595717265	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.3599422615	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.367203713468	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.907785611449	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.797792893865	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.523002203443	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.612701115291	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.514490743081	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.236563124298	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.288226975647	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.180174797166	I will do that.
0.0	0.436953376579	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.70097367593	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.587826800286	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.14886156378	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.353687311501	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.718151488612	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.463539517416	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.18743794041	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.228414202968	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.368061525311	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.785586724217	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.355854299776	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.276672974554	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.18535128882	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.602919645406	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.536345941717	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.624193245452	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.213647233094	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.0646852694814	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.637659738185	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.231185170316	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.24897709794	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.133258663355	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.233533828596	Alright.
0.0	0.400286822453	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.200238290855	...
0.0	0.227424617262	No their not.
0.0	0.0998517648217	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.74212390423	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.262733824561	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.372839999312	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.450189349907	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.14601588363	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.315078145452	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.569001679059	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.422009262987	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.201993101952	Illegal.
0.0	0.333641374711	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.282139889617	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.534277729832	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.17837545258	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.160484331918	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.334927506745	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.70695923498	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.569653748756	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.33459631279	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
1.0	0.857395968538	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.426247273092	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.551158121167	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.511261694056	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.191604247014	I have...
0.0	0.665526140824	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.181081201176	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.519850789494	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.379033289947	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.646085784882	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.368491019628	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.684402756349	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.200934018176	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.143341016812	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.109903969593	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.769106523275	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.377010981814	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.183855519235	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.28032019431	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.115701310605	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.417201799497	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.396061107734	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.239180884137	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.954266897315	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.5	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.0936818671549	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.387457801116	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.752931018555	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.171456777438	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.290398031429	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.441304553374	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.173076305655	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.473766858836	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.658267854997	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.438131948677	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.171442091608	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.466346413354	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.341409228801	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.265533684218	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.217361210694	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.557753720209	He just writes out an order, executive order.

1.0	0.956342487973	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.611995975486	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.522340337419	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.844551148696	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.366133870869	I didn't say permanently.

0.0	0.934994382377	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.

0.0	0.982331825995	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.335036494797	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.172305454662	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.709315806561	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.

0.0	0.534112005522	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.343908577564	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.444070494117	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.125480608242	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.711389127572	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.261440338731	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.380205282757	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.197499251674	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.348568649333	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.211438574735	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.220546038983	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.775089749004	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.122972469199	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.72099604978	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.421385386507	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.769281803758	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.599434417653	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.33224155493	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.281201739019	That's my bill.
0.0	0.58696310505	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.156575449183	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
1.0	0.541656690806	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.200423294458	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.208561852305	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.645281904763	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.139656724859	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.115908947386	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.5	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.384458989264	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.261651020814	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.337281994172	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.468417518032	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.5	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.318438715124	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.68316210361	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.227189410025	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.198214161907	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.368525730569	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.252992967233	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.209126258608	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.590094576443	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.180823354644	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.393619954725	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.318190639968	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.261963801314	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.655702586824	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.937912500056	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.24665871118	Big difference.
0.0	0.885922664575	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.388086584102	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.32308837067	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.296115848435	No vision at all.
0.0	0.54483727426	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.113532915083	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.178454613256	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.698860699498	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.768706108216	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.248724318059	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.166138144003	I agree with them.
0.0	0.225075275621	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.22622910959	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.148300321197	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.174378359104	I don't like that.
0.0	0.979018175448	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.620347461107	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.571791426219	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.374325417842	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.420319096103	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.264095882791	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.312054262134	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.64010103109	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.241994952529	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.0734187637386	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.0723451194018	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.401028049929	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.526025149829	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.464858448865	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.375557053015	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.242797801156	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.295247405895	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.155673006628	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.211322367287	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.377285684991	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.493490958173	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.70038679222	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.193963804651	Okay.
0.0	0.343601468367	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.210989966532	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.211039425907	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.937103165899	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.242986778026	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.82512202884	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.514841409752	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.5	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.601249738619	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.211454552859	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.671689662822	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.542361695405	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.850658712814	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.655745383087	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.7746894855	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.320914538394	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.434272481488	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.381381746246	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.163261439206	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.531314705774	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.931524455668	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
1.0	0.544512690307	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.225015691033	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.515939557736	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.287513283662	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.45040157433	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.5	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.367900383543	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
1.0	0.937249487711	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.530457544343	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.64568446971	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
1.0	0.550885720523	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.176782432709	...Chris...
0.0	0.292138892944	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.85123098975	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.606249797232	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
1.0	0.359784791894	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.0987843999435	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.691866031089	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.635444693865	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.212125137587	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.379053324247	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.636683762898	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.901971104841	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.191714201166	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.471322442279	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.162012078845	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.570986107561	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.455089204092	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.411220893137	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.219871170983	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.270479581017	I want security for this country.
1.0	0.92276345587	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.538389538055	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.360355618925	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.213865663381	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.341804867468	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.419267421429	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.197912061785	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
1.0	0.560845925784	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
1.0	0.544485102457	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.0758711800346	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.245031029077	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.227336185981	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.391748798634	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.381266500448	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.758873779364	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.274903007747	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.718863352284	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.184314877754	Thank you.
0.0	0.5	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.827326113641	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.229094728723	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.29181034026	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.191007433352	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.219184715996	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.671919570736	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
1.0	0.20605655195	That's wrong.
0.0	0.51672830675	Two points.
0.0	0.363129854027	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.745196286067	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
1.0	0.652939464163	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.657682760651	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.854525195378	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.809758229493	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.650813166537	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.390890587972	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.418587601716	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.266316646348	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.575503986721	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.373946454127	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.436242711268	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.20048308743	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.321995010729	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.228352843815	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.312892867475	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.254896188003	We have to do something.
0.0	0.321051426367	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.307038212191	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.191187310419	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.320046201572	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.607570548599	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.725608235826	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.281166452206	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.419843559131	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.505451210714	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.785622503895	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
1.0	0.534037580456	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.377449139982	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.219065804383	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.316119879739	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.280334782738	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.371937422399	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.103995484153	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.15585906201	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.609731943053	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.561544584746	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
1.0	0.0712602033541	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.399684090171	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.469615037083	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.129612015871	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.225414390612	Dynamically.
0.0	0.263606180243	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.487441552908	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.810666493763	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.55536186358	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.370054693064	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.614488525316	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.419733695241	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.214186067524	I will not do that.
0.0	0.296943847876	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.211528379571	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.257456322336	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.319562516978	Both served.
0.0	0.278940492508	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.542766693852	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.23590585422	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.306925628507	He has never defended...
0.0	0.62555829407	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.200514088862	So you might not.
1.0	0.931649117596	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.356711161476	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.312538104987	Growth is the answer.
1.0	0.936078998605	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.187187777764	We need sound money.
1.0	0.518077112088	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.379699217401	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.28879690137	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.376254653879	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.218319223973	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.5	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
1.0	0.458488097446	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.266641388252	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.227474198352	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.478173796773	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.594929814173	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.258411876732	And we are not England.
0.0	0.215477952969	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.470048688475	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.474016087359	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.196266043552	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.201226403062	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.444533754639	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.5	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.194637543171	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.266920579744	We have no borders.
0.0	0.320348967352	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.310095598253	We are not France.
0.0	0.242303733443	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.408814391161	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.220344358926	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.449196532294	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.462347804995	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.330233654297	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.0717402301212	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.264101014827	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.243223506773	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.245155227084	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.280248507724	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.55412604362	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
1.0	0.802164377895	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.318365298608	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.205351690019	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.429924978052	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.270741112581	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.225414390612	Right.
0.0	0.42020728993	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.302168140881	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.533577440985	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.321043839222	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.811481572794	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.27993266515	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.371269942241	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.515837431838	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.358325187334	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.428679624156	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.620940046156	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.155220290159	I like it.
1.0	0.507398371807	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.354710895666	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.182583039075	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.294098306726	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.128698043177	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.226727216751	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.784760954248	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.293440341745	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.343890385022	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.200206875227	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.147385298902	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.976130783558	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.333845875542	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.483872443686	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.606335700591	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.924201418778	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.264626582788	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.141540184034	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.539390575981	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.435665028245	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.206963267443	No.
0.0	0.353319460758	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.176497610221	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.205953920725	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
1.0	0.286476911106	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.139764363136	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.0895661201206	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.142539395577	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.311429708466	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.307349791305	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.21724539464	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.232708893034	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.229498676091	It is a real horror.
1.0	0.900574141166	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.427757634622	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.290270992983	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.565070699655	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.162023111707	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.239131608112	to save a company.
0.0	0.444339548962	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.5	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.294252718873	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.675050941408	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.0733444187699	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.155139057379	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.665392782344	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.937181340221	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
1.0	0.421280095387	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.297477733692	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.21918611607	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.591066066816	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.358041364017	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.465667077606	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.302086497621	That's fine.
0.0	0.645709136793	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.1539397701	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.148624387343	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.232675816005	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.22127025602	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.451052879429	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.12419799335	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.219065804383	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.170567370411	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.43599401316	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.115416398978	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.491368647431	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.254190533268	You have to lead.
0.0	0.186082148618	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.533539606719	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.133884629628	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.359952821948	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.414433019925	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.319317537221	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.335450622195	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.632715656662	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.223492598432	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.24113346807	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.836112322444	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.186561418427	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.537385845188	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
1.0	0.449191357306	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.361926267894	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.235871101444	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.153652666276	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.091623083923	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.217730206245	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
1.0	0.337613895777	They stole it.
0.0	0.282857792326	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.662678077036	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.279162281241	They're a scam.
0.0	0.351005002847	She was right.
0.0	0.21936131752	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.273422246275	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.102255040399	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.315487354909	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.374898758594	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.193963804651	OK.
0.0	0.667762861422	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.66817688836	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.547044929916	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.82492689541	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.215736496028	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.646661100655	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.473002086532	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.199012913918	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.320926576853	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.26436595164	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.803722763669	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.

0.0	0.0992397322898	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.155809898213	Well, that's easy to answer.

0.0	0.295589177638	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.207372360789	And for good cause.
0.0	0.530408389898	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.24572764049	That is not right.

0.0	0.182225232546	No, it should be repealed.
1.0	0.73053443189	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.351725082289	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.774113260333	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.260381563042	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.522908902067	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.0594046683538	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.506309500253	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.786598550849	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.441620733935	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.687353884721	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.265669861021	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.226966309079	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.56864951149	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.201643618152	That's good.
0.0	0.154553674201	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.85855032038	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.265434862117	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.07170815706	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.352363366869	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.27300577615	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.

0.0	0.901940742036	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.306946756931	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.274660793272	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.45059395766	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.696243514652	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.12312416294	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.32861870032	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.102132741235	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.408855837644	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.450106130327	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.149846194659	I'd consider it.
1.0	0.629505183584	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
1.0	0.823232155499	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.218911467118	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.519560071697	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.288837200069	The number of women --
0.0	0.176900074266	You looking at me?
0.0	0.727475412015	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.4058504409	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.72370669215	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
1.0	0.163120546187	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.207477182928	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.465472011437	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.257904292242	I will be that new leader.
1.0	0.279914975354	This president is undermining our military.
1.0	0.887131833573	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.276557535684	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.516648964455	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.209574240105	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.736744556518	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.690735299018	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.282695563891	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.135342062871	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.444820411013	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.403062927148	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.240715752141	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.308681766687	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.358098096525	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.420466955173	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
1.0	0.834607596001	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.5	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.338916772333	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.290442800763	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.266245416832	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.472080507308	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.684559583073	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.458115747925	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.270474541354	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.725766569033	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.377654039016	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.284487940279	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.389959583717	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.140084346592	You just want to...
0.0	0.264595624299	On welfare.
0.0	0.402863897473	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.371496759099	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.758376678265	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.638338752844	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.163605442526	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.542634219314	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.392089857209	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.245344555634	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.904857399059	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.22264776182	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.633541733606	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.273972548961	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.219827472759	No, John.
0.0	0.335854739623	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.470374579825	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.337628609222	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.834782957847	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
1.0	0.802756421282	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.29905667088	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.836159196688	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.121562672955	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.285263282032	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.315470075895	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.221618647771	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.112710037825	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.379473784606	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.65589458588	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.645813372899	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.735707052921	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.297298123962	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.0816964339182	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.464011709959	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.389202180853	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.679935785058	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.193963804651	Yes.
0.0	0.434673052027	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.493031586432	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.285417250132	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.270825268295	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.64322714864	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.292875718747	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.308290384389	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.192672960065	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.61414063518	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.548650452185	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.233533828596	John.
0.0	0.452515652352	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.317639053208	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.482932268373	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.178966295984	You know why?
0.0	0.826521384811	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.309539975828	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.0720705633798	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.673918535943	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.260051264904	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.279587712476	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.479683228095	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.556864535158	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.309549406521	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.264858290916	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.0305324628051	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.211460544411	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?

0.0	0.598814657428	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.208572870532	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.238452276703	It never happens.
0.0	0.698860699498	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.480013746147	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.418369983054	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.611806000257	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.237945245238	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.0903957890944	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.548303770758	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.311444438315	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.226161473141	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.328689505926	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.835224720501	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.306143082791	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.900840741613	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.187034652152	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.518988703121	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.225414390612	Absolutely.
0.0	0.892749426733	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.414953524466	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.384231127489	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.40501994958	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.582265585631	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.448148478235	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.217304326894	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
1.0	0.782135393245	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.151213167864	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.460711024212	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.160244664285	It feels different.
0.0	0.427764333886	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.702410777683	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.203494309154	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.379305961377	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.382343649118	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.412803894847	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.817522024636	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.190823745544	You're welcome.
0.0	0.286678248717	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.390532642605	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.0950462772712	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.782448446689	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.363909618716	I was the architect.
0.0	0.41769667086	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.476731898255	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.376401156261	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.310470313684	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.547167506937	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.422444329542	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.817071306276	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.221255543695	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.787688899909	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.473297540138	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.207679467771	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.108672733498	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0360074029116	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
1.0	0.295926373991	They were wrong.
0.0	0.396958011696	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.226491905867	I win.
0.0	0.796863084042	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.222856309546	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.49224980283	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.321464114811	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.300795590976	You did.
0.0	0.149197432534	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.471458941702	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.0930321450211	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
1.0	0.352274897252	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.0943783981676	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.07826797089	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.381648173968	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.247883199429	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.169803347415	Why?
0.0	0.393581401766	Just for the record.
0.0	0.256164796855	The answer is no.
0.0	0.406783580171	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.738783703698	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.18473488644	He's wrong.
0.0	0.447518769405	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.30063365314	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.259252622488	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.249572165782	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.401647502005	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.416825861661	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.692728232611	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.0755483954408	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.227194361374	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.235770570706	And, we said no.
0.0	0.48735502854	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.216838878343	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.78623869934	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.414194223857	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.359952821948	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.263047006254	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.609359921953	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.327484030747	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.556014063605	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.149091255524	I would just say that...
0.0	0.219280862196	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.535488808829	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.426497649501	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.269258950129	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.137487317013	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.390262444702	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.288518811368	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.267779302979	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.456951564681	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.244523801336	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.36046198922	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
1.0	0.710249822221	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.542619784087	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.318000681835	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.259202243975	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.203210027853	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
1.0	0.316328827624	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.343806464616	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.36314594574	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.309429712467	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.279979613627	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.702258664169	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.121435320393	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.260388553848	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.483962810447	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
