0.0	0.752179451006	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.203230032984	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.647545001407	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.316790086022	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.177486753196	We know this for a fact.

0.0	0.197275056948	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.208013963225	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.540742600032	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.582848845254	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.247862618754	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.690392545402	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.352030829948	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.439954684992	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.449046727426	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.760915321043	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.591613207763	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.713093553457	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.473876917265	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.

0.0	0.471439818314	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.520695660659	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.394496899261	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.235962976114	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.383819219427	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.327936885258	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.241434030996	No.
1.0	0.64496668696	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.360132797802	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.70286104526	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.708735089065	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.353863192547	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.799313279523	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.0708815352109	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.188180691916	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.333847562777	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.710650255507	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.198510535437	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.339575706261	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.315825495029	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.561344975527	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.989831681266	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.241177396732	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.111111342586	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.233516520471	You really can't.
0.0	0.782389051165	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.239490310308	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.248494852592	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.42029305052	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.328995504776	But here's the real key.
1.0	0.67507763666	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.342301551777	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.269269933917	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.312312605962	Divide that out.
0.0	0.520855084034	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.207909768363	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.292071315663	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.512137229458	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.16386748731	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.878397579785	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.449525830873	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.297249206125	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.534670571949	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.404402825071	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.33986677658	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.226309988341	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.210815277239	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.173963556808	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.248679899872	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.702281520829	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.267272911756	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.811679297573	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.287529217621	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.214101638953	In addition to that...
0.0	0.433172346563	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
1.0	0.658956250872	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.586190228029	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.637487633979	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.357564529456	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.671709742221	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.523638625442	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.244431199628	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.579631965214	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.173451980635	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.245241010836	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.651716476954	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
1.0	0.44363141207	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.176340198353	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.266232343886	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.23148145687	We're running.
0.0	0.523119304865	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.294503687139	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.551941955935	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.312816373384	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.226445924349	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.210102979117	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.527997413744	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.277562699883	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.281981766899	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.128956492285	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.212710382832	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.200182870203	Yes.
0.0	0.231553638331	I can't do it.
0.0	0.550903867229	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.40518783373	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.809633510371	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.112945494955	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.366826504924	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.757386562898	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.332932202262	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.125216855721	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.485335158684	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.22622702516	And God bless America.
0.0	0.192196082973	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.406865684986	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.809666897547	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.335990364465	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.249335167823	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.370035202991	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.195902114775	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.210342418324	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.900272664869	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.646277319705	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.833199627143	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.57067994666	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.26021078329	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.342284213496	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.459136995083	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.875554709882	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.744436545335	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.181305397652	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.210649288449	Thank you.
0.0	0.680122171442	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.170919425907	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.237564970878	You do.
0.0	0.540051651929	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.418174108672	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.351150364742	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.938854396137	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.742302662635	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.370464953744	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.488659428345	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.479545841841	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.470640023342	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.340173272013	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.268090346155	We have to obey the laws.
1.0	0.211161725371	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.172878090856	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.0821476198454	And guess what?
0.0	0.939267133389	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.321705261436	We actually did it.
0.0	0.75768192207	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.320333554322	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.554253572403	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.284161899374	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.236818206629	It never happens.
0.0	0.886150722319	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
1.0	0.832761897675	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.387003506395	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.50881850868	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.385140030119	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.50897269847	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.461173863673	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.21951899633	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.655526062621	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.365116468822	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.308883569086	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.273304749104	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.269271035311	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.151930744985	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.155157331039	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.252060920712	You know that.
0.0	0.249162701354	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.197475458857	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.610131134257	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.244732521994	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.960117032969	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.287580381802	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.692509681252	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.322227581962	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.15498249129	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.445396304346	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.305078672884	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.163578936483	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.329171450396	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.590345410299	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.464305938055	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.311634041908	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.5	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.300910346238	That's not right.
0.0	0.167138601157	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.39511259928	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.272786063088	You get together.
0.0	0.260356033426	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.120432316522	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.545683004167	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.340823929715	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.476148421672	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.342686161605	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.463226983483	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.410416703123	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.354704087825	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.140665918222	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.370032084244	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.273351132439	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.402168130408	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.151378745382	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.25357996234	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.241716295937	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.243169513927	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.303192056323	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.213703449033	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.181258286361	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.181255035634	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.214118662911	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.340716794081	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.2522041952	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.35207018714	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.808202223172	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.819275378723	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.225575192062	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.668224679049	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.365298411544	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.600300594011	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.740794083018	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.365849905572	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.217013629743	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
1.0	0.444176213586	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.741525915827	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.302185288181	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.340328218048	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.0406676487469	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
1.0	0.630289273006	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.0970413137303	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.200170124882	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.690029079688	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.610279580825	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
1.0	0.8768895298	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.788050593254	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.150598783886	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.359582638468	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.401867838608	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.306602021864	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.63109877817	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.211312933473	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.337914381539	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.36669293621	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.258241801444	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.492152384651	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.394792192117	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.761134440409	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
1.0	0.336214024709	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.305348871879	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.30857680949	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.333599106276	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.125920526874	How great is that?
0.0	0.794143595155	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.590995302902	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.255274606086	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.457794503158	He hit oil.
0.0	0.650565263681	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.45472335969	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.887305818349	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.244347227678	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.406908660585	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.163885663708	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.296532698513	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.377650650674	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.41887717246	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.243854466674	Right.
0.0	0.21571959018	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.556009958976	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.29279599123	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.468813709531	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.443492648457	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.258863465958	This is 2016.
0.0	0.17393436767	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.0805837249268	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.72370263331	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.42339236032	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.250444984395	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.5	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.660423084987	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.478235832551	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.390432053955	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.303161778017	She said the truth.
0.0	0.366265893928	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.333227200917	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.2911651502	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.197980167001	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.292846794697	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.439369369833	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.143353115915	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.334420020446	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.515096109375	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.360655000292	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.420887892381	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.478002664029	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.258401358379	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.27082136922	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.365124202623	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.20232424969	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.233472113573	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.302855506409	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.277456573954	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.488694869922	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.666969797161	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.287321517148	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.452207241104	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.610816342496	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.232881513113	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.663902849356	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.675859052563	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.195938820519	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.59915573227	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.66333955744	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.537708003509	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.200182870203	Yes.
0.0	0.313858691665	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.365057652249	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.263915269365	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.428153282237	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.454155906971	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.459554217198	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.228687462901	in particular.
0.0	0.454806221077	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.723826984558	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.210985213033	You know why?
0.0	0.370522972396	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.37001654033	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.224597325999	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.220764777202	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.399828611571	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.302678594027	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.217637022131	That's for sure.
0.0	0.240650415473	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.0655454434269	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.219337264052	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.512486555607	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.555401331565	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.234614688648	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.825049637602	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.241434030996	No.
0.0	0.363474917806	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.492317837032	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.27764487473	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.306761279393	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.210649288449	Thank you.
0.0	0.35739713071	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.595536399217	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.454604130348	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.617284000115	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.258491828638	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.452754726097	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.218193048721	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.593860880564	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.224783043315	Think about that.
0.0	0.872590480527	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
1.0	0.531399648145	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.343266425403	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.351339547758	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.472404389316	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.241434030996	No.
0.0	0.303516454419	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.304236508163	And you know what?
0.0	0.892793992074	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.696679064509	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.346365972844	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.395005896484	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.404856447995	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.468561796266	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.441094047396	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.20322479452	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.0405830455687	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.395207388577	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.282379058488	Creativity.
0.0	0.544338907482	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.262409406706	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.380434592507	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.13827934457	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.563665192508	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.390923706128	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.155447339668	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.384298405561	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.445486303454	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.341182532194	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.159857458168	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.482845974605	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.871964434133	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.279493537123	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.605448144872	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.508398347869	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.206792660481	I'm aware of that.
1.0	0.799610771079	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.347515930204	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.347421435071	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.457416725962	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.339247680728	I didn't find it offensive at all.
1.0	0.731192697454	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.484372376771	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.460056660251	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.210649288449	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.372715619468	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.132203132438	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.400034493993	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.279132714382	Check it out.
0.0	0.219949864423	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.304980086634	Came out great.
0.0	0.245936514006	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.734649293606	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.381903916297	That never works.
0.0	0.318972783621	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.191454250673	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.589242599782	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.248343090419	About Medicare?
0.0	0.342188140422	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.156630328583	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.221522189616	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.116229273127	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.0836962579161	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.134836603108	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.110490714964	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.227524300575	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.658997444666	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.240100291092	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.624141951012	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.12406940851	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.370888448191	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.200981979279	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.476417980106	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.575671378568	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.593259898285	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.691577804078	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.264147252876	Our next president...
0.0	0.542230229893	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.5	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.239662540773	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.746744457366	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.242179301332	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.322439925258	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.559422560216	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.386526913133	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.139137089835	Why is that?
0.0	0.346462280755	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.860103268844	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.676863081023	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.896909297995	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.626828422927	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
1.0	0.872755481489	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.195014929679	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.429944496626	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.632136922399	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.333853119356	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.19727069945	I don't care.
0.0	0.406352259706	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.0685309591592	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.290234246262	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.569194242688	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.538389164601	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.533031958346	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.284850220763	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.449369891666	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.177158776444	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.0804041251713	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.933024883849	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.629680030259	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.445686524868	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.253855279918	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.709605011293	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.529446344409	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.0694526736664	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.295629341749	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.447266299757	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.264879827299	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.818317731564	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.262393752802	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.478271836195	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.876196130992	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.404152917279	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.712056927232	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.479458713331	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
1.0	0.697655755089	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.212072903611	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.170330601407	How do I know this?
0.0	0.125448166113	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.507030904421	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.331143444134	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.351769746922	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.399425321458	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.527877909059	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.188533396897	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.158023905684	I understand.
0.0	0.206182475522	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.670776576297	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.241434030996	No.
1.0	0.313777471483	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.339197791053	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.572691984527	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.217053423537	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.790048711194	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.113617181345	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.96782620991	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.449046481142	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.293036007846	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.317242748571	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.912620604149	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.856993996821	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.170220472295	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.207348747034	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.337982451072	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
1.0	0.780014122053	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.573517426124	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.332435346597	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.401667373682	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.794070058791	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.267439660572	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.311092397037	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.488403494199	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.188798027593	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.577592244367	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.216559069804	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.264520583856	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.134191837047	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.544321150045	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.608034899159	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.651500234695	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.366768011718	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.456253283657	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.490057276162	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.372299952581	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.145978677399	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.304021808845	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.517792907802	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.576171065696	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.307232464374	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.175888815483	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.70026366668	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.272267767474	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.319048257533	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.173232584309	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.703032644443	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.577266546915	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.0835428189131	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.394534293143	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.637936507482	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.206286178754	Well, sure.
0.0	0.5	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.731258802332	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.438370343855	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.508171230121	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.14739651845	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.687171985165	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.207878913241	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.712030012973	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.216111340988	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.33535468593	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.285042114132	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.342644946382	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.295585370034	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.335350642241	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.273875889906	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.300741809386	I got that.
0.0	0.11143114398	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.184235268064	It's a joke.
0.0	0.206555123511	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.347507083293	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.449319695422	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.236646167089	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.338332789109	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.262715835153	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.155465252457	I like that.
0.0	0.794131265525	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.181918546568	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.271147167783	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.656066724843	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.348202231023	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.862602013298	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.629632376326	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.584818791342	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.240954362585	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.821457495718	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.530758423787	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.291500203782	Not bad.
0.0	0.574850245093	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.789676343067	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.514004634322	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.493161666178	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.785746403109	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.171020665752	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.434460868956	They're sick of politics as usual.
1.0	0.56342899529	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.842218649021	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.25302040888	You don't have to.
0.0	0.00912951309658	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.14922398648	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.274310460932	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.448165855631	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.404856652413	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
1.0	0.526922399737	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.605516676138	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.480275343381	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.968012201701	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.369847953634	You know why three?
0.0	0.488891624323	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.249875115026	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.359850973849	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.226833143518	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.249483628023	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.461446598608	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.57723420625	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.361534659456	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.813282669271	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.200182870203	Yes.
0.0	0.627898879581	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.329584509415	It was.
0.0	0.0551720439191	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.307149196369	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.441693914196	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.736115473418	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.238174983921	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.154646724119	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.210649288449	Thank you.
0.0	0.5	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.283629361782	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.138047701425	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.320682655026	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.13117624346	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.372754625317	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.412995732083	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.367964854645	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.331340889629	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.197767781151	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.46357093771	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.206502451642	I'll say this.
0.0	0.912795219402	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.161161756653	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.483001582855	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.488596261588	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.340974093959	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.310686540538	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.0837324361901	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.323185527174	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.831322023417	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.0575751669159	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.143418229616	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.262181404359	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.923257959049	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.331743947139	But I was born here.
0.0	0.521934389545	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.394415118465	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.31906713393	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.5	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.14542842245	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.693224036045	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.487410128436	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.0670765531073	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.159410145867	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.180871901652	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.204269941043	It is.
0.0	0.829993477342	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.816416473797	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.296142206032	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.528263448104	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.817335081222	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.267933902148	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.399692921231	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.334749078434	We were wrong.
0.0	0.210649288449	Thank you.
0.0	0.0926660938546	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.368368352965	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.580468594014	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.341720325994	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.442077602253	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.308258956935	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.77225201722	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.188398325823	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.231553638331	We can't do it.
0.0	0.131228945567	I think he is right.
0.0	0.0123410505559	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.117475888908	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.15607370023	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.771115410045	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.0156465771969	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.208991929968	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.566372092717	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.115701473441	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.295567424425	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
1.0	0.80935618584	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.241228814074	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.0321946941762	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.211927595265	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.686529992375	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.405547651557	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.564182153846	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.318871284597	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.150043006373	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.406080636492	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.118205266951	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.304236508163	But you know what?
0.0	0.166737324797	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
1.0	0.235482084413	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.676451900617	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.286153666593	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.117625375183	It's true.
0.0	0.205054485123	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.438403874287	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.249552354439	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.246309673311	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.3662056814	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.698217082514	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.510745082811	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.809312443944	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.554886146853	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.142547583092	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.377085394474	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.619908643261	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.214035987484	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.333551630296	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.722933762754	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.22005547727	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.274174471695	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.174770857544	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.286550677276	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.0774244241161	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.459734074959	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.373246575099	He is a good man.
0.0	0.274251681783	That has not been...
0.0	0.312072636313	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.455311869446	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.604400278644	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.358846055517	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.308580979884	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.230357062373	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.55999269124	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.53454246239	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.765241528248	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.310601813395	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.156041948281	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.666208920647	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.280983601568	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.941517252662	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.182037567165	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.223644333434	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.345668223181	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.552611190215	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.825105942033	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.509097021756	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.390488522263	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.688260331618	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.28411188075	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.257920024351	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.175378475942	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.344484252306	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.434026540272	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.234958768196	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.63724616647	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.55680652828	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.630413282717	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.125241122944	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.364102484991	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.551009131867	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.51788487788	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.57609586065	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.5	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.494743865912	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.509687434774	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.486311187562	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.722523113459	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.781181196257	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.274846694571	That will change everything.
0.0	0.524163164684	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.119355604825	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.0630531036038	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.129278568122	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.14936552715	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.410160676738	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.333219595696	I never said that.

0.0	0.359451835887	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."

0.0	0.184438522896	That is...
0.0	0.29302464968	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.233530847926	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.226974700145	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.152485406228	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.265685507151	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.0986067687881	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.210649288449	Thank you.
0.0	0.242270025524	We're not doing it.
1.0	0.537015927633	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.523082989477	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.

0.0	0.40197187369	Good at email.
0.0	0.217998618779	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.827553329382	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.524672862755	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.198766067818	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.635509756439	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.125034665154	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.350350719508	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.171484580974	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.0808979691873	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.72693954041	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.293230247707	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.452187681819	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.268454551017	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.0680632342486	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.0646296991141	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.343471961752	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.198627135506	Think about it.
0.0	0.241434030996	No.
0.0	0.208338175328	...
0.0	0.512533706581	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.656817278613	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.345366851824	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.235633146105	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.307572899069	He got lucky with fracking.
1.0	0.92466995991	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.546085719713	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.309613951846	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.340757637403	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.25808535565	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.400606948021	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.790026055654	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.191949046363	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.231690845926	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.369617160464	I know every one.
0.0	0.364248767922	That's the difference.
0.0	0.911051623081	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.550946515213	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.304236508163	And you know what?
0.0	0.301513605544	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.409510716094	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.181564459181	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.359785690396	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.673907703539	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.15509825551	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.551583145557	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.284947435977	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.306868088591	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.731257538416	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.154429138814	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.922820875259	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.878676776834	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.299992361609	I've done it.
0.0	0.604826395382	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.624454497009	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.0851675061979	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.457826369899	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.279824628584	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.669449703369	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.391359128667	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.18497413324	You bet they do.
0.0	0.269729976375	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.421311175468	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.40782507414	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.641939626058	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.278789553302	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.597161815323	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
1.0	0.494585221127	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.328954163349	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.338520373316	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.369205095635	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.609497812709	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.564840270338	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.200311821693	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.524304291335	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.542636234479	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.2486725774	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.263686781174	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.214554121935	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.365539182687	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.437544861116	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.270467338791	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.0353220498088	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.507811905183	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.148665294457	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.762864928347	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.692509681252	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
1.0	0.285422470823	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.170682013116	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.296715185004	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.210649288449	Thank you.
0.0	0.12953328743	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.200860022842	I want security.
0.0	0.447766954328	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.395322198726	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.266662333227	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.170694008346	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.

0.0	0.230151150976	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.345782273285	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.

0.0	0.402923755725	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.405214174443	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.190481339193	Wait for what?
0.0	0.487048723395	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.100810277163	And I want to just suggest to you.

0.0	0.5	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.109921271554	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.0617125477137	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.372977466301	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.296065866525	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.259301903926	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.666930369961	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.362228687951	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.593392551342	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.290917393926	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.481910921823	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.612543881327	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.506375224334	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.46790234049	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.432234826804	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.236904135639	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.292119076924	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.338632469625	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.586577932462	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.273923713603	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.308744407635	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.

0.0	0.885497703483	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.417443462054	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.275713271741	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.

0.0	0.429407064075	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.120599540917	But...
0.0	0.14140228341	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.517236412304	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.891366716816	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.590701208999	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.356104042289	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.

0.0	0.355221026391	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.244516113969	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.394784094228	I changed that.
0.0	0.508326819692	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.371473877667	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.433387340208	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.291803856595	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.243347060553	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.243854466674	Ever.
0.0	0.441599235291	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.

0.0	0.287117918482	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.434303540091	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.32082779424	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.407306565537	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.241434030996	No.
0.0	0.390486304024	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.

0.0	0.472918749233	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.239779464913	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.873158186628	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.26755709224	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.310965891551	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.561372329826	That's right, three pages.

0.0	0.336658864027	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.

0.0	0.205054485123	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.187505875383	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.210649288449	Thank you.
0.0	0.31733406717	That's not true.
0.0	0.250664099146	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.267050876026	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.0746203184851	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.0543252396569	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.590188140935	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.188263563491	I believe we are on the path to doing that.

0.0	0.183921238822	Just want to get that out there, just saying.

0.0	0.232132380356	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.163015502829	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.237627230341	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.604647437602	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.296654634659	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.611278564079	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.273153382861	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.235957238408	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.231555291496	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.714220577246	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.609548702763	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.297471094012	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.198190287423	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.335014500681	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.261248319607	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.195844737401	So...
0.0	0.670466555848	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.431299322534	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.35327060831	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.395120687972	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.302041992983	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.604570624967	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.374693405156	I have no idea.
0.0	0.24986449377	We don't win.
0.0	0.334750953027	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.463723803	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.264631050684	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.428544033103	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.884717372514	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.566484942726	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.42185704874	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.66518120129	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.482289286927	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.5160214552	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.367263917552	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.134114657187	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.168823048826	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.567738973796	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.792611114794	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.280906110823	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.448165855631	It's driving up stock prices.
1.0	0.295037193815	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.598000559763	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
1.0	0.596412767628	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.510106607919	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.447868272302	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.321866383535	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.38007536999	Do we still have standards?
1.0	0.404803432002	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.197296392184	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.885527773766	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.363970442996	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.40389755598	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.538769169037	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.366136918608	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.605019582836	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.226775841418	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
1.0	0.573790352385	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.196901181039	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.551833906106	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.0989138580821	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.140357548953	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.880943355765	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
1.0	0.976568291072	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.

0.0	0.210649288449	Thank you.
1.0	0.701472136049	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.13638250276	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.234722691728	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.627848521804	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.256422223448	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.

0.0	0.590856108144	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.593939827613	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.328302562307	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.872137499125	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.114272766175	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.62907509473	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.23281362725	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.797198043782	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.669504560293	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.141234545835	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.134620676351	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.5	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.381409009856	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.312998829746	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.363689051192	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.353865969381	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.238334211505	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.

0.0	0.588318064888	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
1.0	0.807257629265	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.277439503306	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.271476570726	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.

0.0	0.485230280453	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.61880590155	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0632233517204	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.318973089646	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.464596119553	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.303703529386	My background is different.

0.0	0.763381312604	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.

0.0	0.335918094376	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.57928743965	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.22163606805	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.751414942153	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.3588861058	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.

0.0	0.26274653249	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.410292676877	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.342647132536	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
1.0	0.172707237958	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.677053480858	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.564358865528	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.358182443048	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.5	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.

0.0	0.376716449453	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.593573956682	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.279728024312	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.21019753721	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.128177308776	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.712725382863	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.166587223015	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.547664122185	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.397186134272	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.370567144409	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.244622627048	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.362076352769	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.208832300577	(inaudible).
0.0	0.489386290942	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.200182870203	OK?
0.0	0.645118025837	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.347506053559	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.352986278622	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.350278962452	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.794777760976	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.208202180214	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.339307217282	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.663219592979	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.816353414636	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.577219580009	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.227307500091	I can do that.
0.0	0.186586636659	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.529143330317	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.65820427071	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.430800154683	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.107072937544	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.300529717758	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.15369763837	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.176224896162	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.795465108152	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.822848593007	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.55558355333	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.194735531192	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.329952203703	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.183652235964	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.293630373958	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.115506470427	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
1.0	0.521109995079	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.270907845419	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.263530728199	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.756618670132	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.643910754749	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.203459700011	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.175424620397	I would change them.
0.0	0.243599129155	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.363441996209	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
1.0	0.853020170413	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.101020593699	I think you're --
0.0	0.5	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.354764193078	It's not that complicated actually.
1.0	0.838742287285	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.684204479699	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.61993376753	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.813485649048	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
1.0	0.766172959554	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.312211704411	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.5	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.184778047908	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.412626438713	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.630607826097	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.410547196031	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.919064756777	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.257739409083	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.262215081781	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.545656018602	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.34334503571	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.978500407899	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.391004790892	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.400463632407	Folks, we've got to wake up.
1.0	0.958035643716	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.0874994947074	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.449623160345	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.17290645414	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.5	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.233920902333	OK, good.
0.0	0.299311828028	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.31576417362	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.385910215569	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.292368224114	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.426541299578	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.845744144051	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.143597291366	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.433989025674	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.367289132679	So you know what?
0.0	0.187448926549	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.198555235807	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.587767709215	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.23722354292	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.117289402909	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.529874892206	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.532025419415	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.41152631843	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.519471457063	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.15367145177	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.168174638428	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.490945396747	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.167124494823	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.247322222178	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.303021800608	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
1.0	0.983113268714	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.332082531656	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.237564970878	We do.
0.0	0.5	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.204137706405	It's their money.
0.0	0.304236508163	And you know what?
0.0	0.460008392938	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.429541656137	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.716353954607	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.5	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.512585446788	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.220238758775	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.0905169648982	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.130553762324	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.65728284905	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.517935864023	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.762027219992	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.283189436867	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.108389414311	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.669930260254	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.205103445169	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.873745122246	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.221802844145	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.363071794391	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.170771925807	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.122622863876	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.241365595801	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.345928109173	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.436357449409	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.766999811618	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.124463965896	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.657910568535	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.259537031579	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.73888467995	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.298319163197	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.512180822226	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.558268464275	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.136594778066	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.547198372503	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.212362181236	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.176773992501	...Chris...
0.0	0.192250185496	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.147879450986	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.643142924245	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.523404634134	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.390319356723	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.288018573416	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.442764189743	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.677474701661	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.147198762298	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.143518675655	And our economy was growing like crazy.
1.0	0.761121038558	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.265013707596	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.327731160078	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.113140326692	No, it's true.
0.0	0.5	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.159555239414	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.528676119926	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.5	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.673168248516	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.21646371635	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.286209393064	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.120599540917	And...
0.0	0.328070053524	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.5	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.575272937058	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.327970875527	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.589050188479	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.534981069184	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.343456491682	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.345681199434	White people?
0.0	0.13667182947	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.059624465799	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.125513903111	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0903294215918	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.617283775507	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.462083634516	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.456134676058	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.321426210526	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.236003152094	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.208338175328	...
0.0	0.505846825745	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.52950080821	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.370865510442	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.313011447652	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.34711727205	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.640788194306	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.157818559637	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.382011121369	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.47752018125	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.142546279443	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.777171431107	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.189803974485	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.431444824419	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.350698933501	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
1.0	0.457987300575	Very few children.
0.0	0.370684293889	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.386926174009	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.52965614231	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.430396107489	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.592147523151	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.512359564055	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.753186663187	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.214107311637	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.229027859135	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.372502536543	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.134651785437	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.217221462184	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.336068701631	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.286632242502	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.311422105921	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.720505747217	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.531239639738	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0657863789823	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.76162745455	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.0487381290662	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.516410267667	He was on the board.
0.0	0.217866563843	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.304630979895	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.331804427272	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.773847446704	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.898835124648	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.697123369127	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.220713352362	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.243868407924	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.297091325121	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.178276900609	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.310828304254	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.247918378835	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.452134807924	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.28312492292	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.300910346238	That's not right.
0.0	0.615368848003	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.272786063088	You're right.
0.0	0.595131582771	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.235507233912	No, no.
0.0	0.717803722945	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.594682459743	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.34631852488	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.671662899714	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.16392833924	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.506875842773	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.304328472609	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.0376530992615	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.463538610652	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.1768912688	But I would add this.
0.0	0.20903189759	This will end.
0.0	0.517579077835	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.712338854903	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.353282532159	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.297867825095	That's right.
0.0	0.81053450387	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.798033173448	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.208833379913	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.548904403072	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.797985190423	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.87564461172	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.422316376075	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.3906768897	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.824193671769	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.431539817623	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.215167802121	And so do I.
0.0	0.0438669653873	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.344620012977	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.113250615723	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.219476079751	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.668656887503	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.728517029897	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.175714218635	...Thank you.
0.0	0.178806016756	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.28606526853	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.749582100266	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.374337488797	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.124413896068	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.227011148538	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
1.0	0.351539904571	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.248056124121	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.335467913608	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.154506032466	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.428397019469	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.197609073134	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.193485946455	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.206852727956	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.147007720304	That's my view.
0.0	0.289277926363	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.711547888603	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
1.0	0.843739351525	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.693851845555	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.613258752934	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.416389140221	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.700748956681	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.272797900321	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.306764166518	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.332484994568	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.152191248838	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.0744600975512	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.567524617683	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.247682167041	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.317352802365	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.243838740363	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.5	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.351363653261	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.43476307544	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.658731786997	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.444889891795	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.463989796936	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.599173682522	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.489572676448	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.397853442613	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.5	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
1.0	0.615614383018	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.481090886185	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.343964228036	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.858018944508	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.3401755955	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.431852209955	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.311570596342	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.632755146306	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.389365716549	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.598009637492	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.183040426692	What should we do?
0.0	0.58278432012	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.23390262159	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.433544233506	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.188525089075	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.249552041006	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.343900678153	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.200182870203	OK.
0.0	0.381051216521	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.239415740165	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.156946966174	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.483829996385	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.433735588116	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.846769467718	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.678665174138	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.200182870203	OK?
0.0	0.216146466553	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.389333646739	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.374120379528	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.138439369628	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.179292871279	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.175430716023	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.387709944755	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.462280902861	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.212263777668	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.793004152544	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.291375927559	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.378616802079	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.176065441714	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.433298989358	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.304236508163	And you know what?
0.0	0.351896939715	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.333219595696	I never said that.
0.0	0.398468140336	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.646870142543	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.406819482902	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.273903387241	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.560350440208	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.0156793758553	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.341460563082	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.362357831765	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.80515024539	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.396772366183	A brief response.
0.0	0.52556782606	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.481225502206	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.372956619833	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.519817001913	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.307723184419	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.462613404673	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.230116586671	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.735053380167	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.723152140808	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.254983153574	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.428618936208	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.426402565413	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.295594254232	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.455756604109	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.408188029371	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.158908784792	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.415040482777	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.242078845263	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.205761188987	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.215138022149	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.451640466159	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.129654603437	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.210649288449	Thank you.
0.0	0.102836016161	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.392836169602	I was not at all.
0.0	0.286831734085	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.274698568403	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.523659198612	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.157094044993	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.19246052372	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.444134413634	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.622987928208	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.452525987229	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.34062841963	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.532313318879	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.242853254554	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.507317807272	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.367296307042	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.628307919412	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.129425917544	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.146815774434	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.0960802744984	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.231804355195	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.0797123145996	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.271898082905	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.653352589382	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.413039144287	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.427031536697	I said no.
0.0	0.835699152626	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.306018864895	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.632267480023	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.659103397839	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.49485495299	You've got to bring people together.

0.0	0.428127053187	The world has changed.
0.0	0.320381532808	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.474825235869	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.21966854009	I promise.
0.0	0.372662238422	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.675349175251	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.210649288449	Thank you.
0.0	0.608555833729	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.237810174249	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.337005412262	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.

0.0	0.560548581366	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.443033082447	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.295295874927	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.161939898243	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.233032436772	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.508475466879	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.329011317165	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.243070940852	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.40033473038	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.299182223578	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.520660203326	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.151055022724	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.186709780864	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
1.0	0.780131009479	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.582044996473	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.311252370877	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.242267570412	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.231210572581	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.539327439928	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.952951287038	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.241132982243	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.605965461899	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.463104350808	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.809377738226	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.692178624815	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.22460791204	We don't need that.
0.0	0.47088359147	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.297538631402	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.74259483886	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.359469749547	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.265218007653	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.110728492727	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.535603427066	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.554457914155	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.140756144878	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.361383086613	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.099624967508	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.188503399593	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.448769211735	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.362535986254	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.451969947134	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.976850027408	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.511046205926	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.520899908952	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.678359608807	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.166667687703	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.262115484118	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.573230135217	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.442670656829	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.66100736061	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.557683875797	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.573764053401	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.539871176582	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.0865939474889	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.230341190564	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.250991644578	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.209238126315	See?
0.0	0.396993928965	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.531055768666	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.109489435401	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.5	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.806847945416	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.178429589597	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.71884403386	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.31165210221	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.210649288449	Thank you.
0.0	0.115697834468	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.331534061916	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.397232485045	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.594937326488	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.432054696556	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.434462131244	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.311891368863	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
1.0	0.61987399746	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.74588967907	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.329800585245	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.695697572654	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.362673550895	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.230183931909	You do the arithmetic.
1.0	0.127979888459	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.480902454507	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.463697625788	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.380463559499	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.472047512673	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.179832261221	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.185258100124	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.604581337106	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.78532483253	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.216791180076	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.375224325529	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.274457635288	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.5	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.435297306707	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.225423799451	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.14827296361	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.469466858155	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.34112106293	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.468366746216	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.43424939942	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.0521199609859	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.5	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.274554299884	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.28730883217	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.188664495116	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.590178349353	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.391164351551	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.127199851144	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.463586748538	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.608890813646	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.456519506359	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.422704149075	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.457587363842	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.368316681196	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.358623672029	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.587225715731	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.0948532752288	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.140866042196	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.571598812325	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.176773992501	...John...
0.0	0.0402645777571	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.219563096382	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.429184239799	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.386052615496	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.337635156244	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.201157456689	We need security.
0.0	0.166815462629	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
1.0	0.862063512086	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.0827689822829	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.399924001633	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.389777040482	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.0869646592423	And here's why.
0.0	0.328111344756	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.241268619191	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.412401463494	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.563989621043	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.319357024276	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.294407783535	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.384151709118	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.714133204028	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.436979438246	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.483222875128	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.430558745699	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.717276326846	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.416383023355	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.188710616331	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.362044318924	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.172488137406	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.255456469664	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.388969189853	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.317903595324	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.158604441282	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.488552938546	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.0684437519981	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.285017776881	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.825303643745	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.

0.0	0.208171171388	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.366922412811	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.226329230395	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.430303838621	I didn't inherit any money.

0.0	0.792509227066	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.

0.0	0.683721305203	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.258289420022	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.218045030642	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.214598053575	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.5	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.41312590124	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.118564609808	...No, sir...
0.0	0.224946603068	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.371203242196	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.427105681977	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.0865710950854	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.

0.0	0.648241957616	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.512958999958	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.268138147752	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.604720958188	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.372575070256	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).

0.0	0.265757535387	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.214705133533	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.797150044676	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.528835123463	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.31529779589	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.438145422741	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.317114825721	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.687432847753	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.442549935601	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.368721261625	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.225803971747	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.270204543279	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.457578197609	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.566373426597	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.644625614867	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.31897816841	Well, I did.
0.0	0.286540129621	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.827366630179	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.288300847055	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.659995875364	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.118449827842	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.163801761295	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.159227103133	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.302046965021	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.705596175657	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.574872121578	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.192310859633	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.222434384006	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.653162200448	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.081347668787	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.462234980723	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
1.0	0.302966160608	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.346022104742	That is our government today.
0.0	0.186401695308	No -- no...
0.0	0.517127545209	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.202001534699	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.244181150397	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.368742986568	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.228356253769	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.892397456513	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.341008479802	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.909109319034	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.256712678619	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.442762908954	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.202398320756	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.118702085172	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.755267545065	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.354991335701	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
1.0	0.368853952462	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.128924274204	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.299654386866	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.203720220277	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.411306018733	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.317974174531	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.232536733973	Let's talk about our campaigns.
1.0	0.776091071993	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.380677531187	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.19365599242	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.648699964093	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.2946724767	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.252872892663	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.448874127876	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.357410661542	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.362585000254	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.662025441432	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.247388416856	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.193730104384	These...
0.0	0.295870805295	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.487944869797	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.475059166378	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.241434030996	No.
0.0	0.413388942191	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.199722755577	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.704966182139	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.294505732421	I've laid out...
0.0	0.669188273919	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.304326588626	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.562345883945	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.192725256649	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.203562152052	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.266703944621	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.410236431174	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.369195541829	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.165871755419	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.280812933007	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.281472611084	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.216433783046	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.342390519371	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.302503777674	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.370428560452	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.456853410709	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.346910133638	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.286714557504	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.289234683242	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.456799029705	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.66778969935	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.611597279376	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.405936416746	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.728097651695	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.803778443717	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.569997971637	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.243854466674	Absolutely.
0.0	0.180450335976	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.571741919855	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.237895345507	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.17310061552	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.119736304055	That's why I ask for your support for president.
1.0	0.537198914739	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.292812750773	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.22272056471	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.686798982019	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.0843466102192	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.668588987144	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.197107916661	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.257576677507	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.190520440127	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.360402506606	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.528572329945	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.222688934711	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.684542725095	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.179164479695	We need sound money.
0.0	0.236107407244	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.398895677423	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.339628833362	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.128905589374	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.261444446993	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.517713286589	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.0854133983269	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.308483136788	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.232863136594	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.284122204292	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.24504846391	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.257234412788	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.271984184944	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.28700128787	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.493356095245	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.272114084854	...income tax...
0.0	0.380866990582	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
1.0	0.242259392081	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.384050319401	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.436152356533	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.365528901657	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.578710083172	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.124463965896	But if you look at working men and women.
1.0	0.70875025149	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.203249226711	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.242270025524	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.36238139048	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.467566704827	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.0623500552529	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.258130271617	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.386510678825	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.431730999466	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.5106593451	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.0902183966823	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.715559774305	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.471984333015	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.164623078304	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.267626659371	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.100493806349	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.106527176043	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.487605946394	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.707750327277	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.177573962989	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.464012408455	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.

0.0	0.667214197224	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.304236508163	And you know what?
0.0	0.5	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.785346591143	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.744053119292	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.475155048026	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.483487689601	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.628805338426	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.319732162917	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.145997303898	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.200182870203	Yeah.
0.0	0.58092572466	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.425484297296	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.298483730007	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.505834602435	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.156878588093	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.278680084964	He's wrong.
0.0	0.125535622332	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.118946937892	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.40770960635	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.391789332033	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.295064664206	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.11495224604	And why?
0.0	0.866942650015	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.387796399555	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.37173419162	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.436265222956	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.0352348885532	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.38289212165	They're a scam.
0.0	0.466755843969	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.805277816331	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.196095715052	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.737082028253	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.202270176723	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.284592573682	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.243854466674	Right.
0.0	0.205701560902	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.250863203154	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.630136790562	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.512838270964	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.184622593046	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.577115430324	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.367400261225	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.552208742077	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.181339318817	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.183680186837	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.345451162627	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.5	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.676254236972	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.256092623063	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.13871383288	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.872755481489	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.289126584633	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
1.0	0.680684337528	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.196726826429	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.0873178847893	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.668109609564	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
1.0	0.816509399231	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.479266949308	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.262415915149	John?
0.0	0.697552487628	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.159428371986	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.406842572893	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.266369083439	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.243379209594	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.316386546702	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.158730627845	But look...
0.0	0.222054335843	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.584111040231	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.242513660777	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.337495517603	You're simply not.
0.0	0.342801651691	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.401552106472	That's what I said.
0.0	0.217291426286	That's what he is.
0.0	0.226059192024	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.294820250787	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.321968813172	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.34979643741	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.873032035062	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.759557726259	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.397867596304	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.663481713573	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.401001224154	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.175299534425	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.333556278044	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.206502451642	I will do that.
0.0	0.53697780308	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.778048086847	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.5	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.185910544862	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.536655642337	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.718453828367	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.440849990484	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.184768509886	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.263475342042	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.366427109309	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.811214273723	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.402273322308	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.183328155654	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.191438545074	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.523718316552	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.407709208765	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.540021147948	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.219900589871	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.0745495453538	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.593579527944	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.314970336096	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.203825332932	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.109221904357	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.262415915149	Alright.
0.0	0.44581548157	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.208338175328	...
0.0	0.226900626763	No their not.
0.0	0.0767493117687	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.762247043727	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.322888132483	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.371562365973	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.258084276514	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.111218041781	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.21693261619	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.463783585704	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.420287691309	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.248309300387	Illegal.
0.0	0.305615355346	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.175965273926	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.697194318076	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.3235497339	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.134356544162	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.348273297425	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.722420320861	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.592799359428	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.28641326702	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
1.0	0.783301000306	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.515175306834	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.580227903556	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.539398685893	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.190140366212	I have...
0.0	0.731516688842	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.227734969007	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.560377510162	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.650580604955	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.643942728129	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.255585884724	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.697531788584	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.150388376503	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.0602746096778	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.171548848951	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.689845028846	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.360842430361	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.24587145621	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.243989115271	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.134532015347	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.561167339219	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.374714874681	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.149625659606	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.950152371138	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.412649776378	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.101705117108	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.336838890025	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.726854992181	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.111802236465	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.310366577959	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.430707892161	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.186778228657	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.450656099706	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.685100592126	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.538329345936	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.126270649664	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.551669994982	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.257955474473	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.29028490816	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.207727864718	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.626306657555	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.374196171277	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.245428666964	Or that we're just going to be great?

1.0	0.919654394052	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.828819560219	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.633212503	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.854035253807	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.379239995282	I didn't say permanently.
1.0	0.632682752674	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.146777947003	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.871565257419	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.138725755091	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.291253608009	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.154601031584	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.977870964399	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.366673001958	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.279152689684	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.674753846279	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.151369973385	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.

0.0	0.372579292707	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.41550865159	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.632990692504	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.

0.0	0.38450466579	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.235431109177	...Rand is exactly right.

0.0	0.164468638224	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.174472059805	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.

0.0	0.646643814759	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.255758095555	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.299327887825	That's my bill.

0.0	0.285535096725	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.243163051498	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.614684369934	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.227145649014	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.161986857627	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.433112713357	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.477446655574	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.303890908277	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.286370075347	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.434860920121	We were behind where we were today.

0.0	0.416205799016	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.252255599183	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.018039925425	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.227685974417	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.235348711307	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.435471429587	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.21747266227	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.367794969692	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.280790501408	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.280104094826	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.546996608142	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.915588745181	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.293650204514	Big difference.
0.0	0.881330145955	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.397570019405	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.33534799858	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.307312859338	No vision at all.
0.0	0.451682920936	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.089147366612	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.222969488203	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.742215903403	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.760545718998	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.264315249928	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.110578742879	I agree with them.
0.0	0.273353913519	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.287637394325	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.14422731555	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.22460791204	I don't like that.
0.0	0.977894358427	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.574828953546	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.48654058912	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.48316867364	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.5	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.304720960997	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.220688444738	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.679794780021	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.266003486381	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.0898968990817	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.140160723822	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.57173491841	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.621409558727	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.416136459187	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.776482223143	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.24755579907	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.664781247416	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.220252039891	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.204058924319	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.412258244109	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.457129452386	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.809128740273	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.200182870203	Okay.
0.0	0.264540768404	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.16848138671	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.206104254442	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.629647374674	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.220799057146	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.780143242317	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.600915180476	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.52801104046	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.850046524772	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.146040112227	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.679307765409	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.606502688844	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.798119524076	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.593600520526	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.563875000986	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.354690321291	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.5	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.357147036406	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.141642881027	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.521768149813	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.889117486142	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
1.0	0.595722309411	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.23330251754	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.448994306563	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.290417787639	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.59134766243	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.423236371831	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.311635043617	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
1.0	0.914636159966	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.508392761507	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.678163125011	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
1.0	0.515551876257	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.176773992501	...Chris...
0.0	0.379842924897	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.784378905604	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.590142691617	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
1.0	0.359291457131	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.117485631865	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.685769685003	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.345091529507	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.404439724223	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.353141659074	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.580603460414	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.787461670531	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.166397221616	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.537874554053	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.138476258829	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.758046733327	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.428034094507	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.433086300743	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.415312741594	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.306259468266	I want security for this country.
1.0	0.922865411702	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.534719803798	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.366715264606	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.290910910773	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.320380570117	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.455157797486	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.227900390908	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
1.0	0.583158707507	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
1.0	0.633700280329	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.000261085206793	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.239822279504	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.191868073585	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.400926420469	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.335031534905	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.56315888755	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.300465135325	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.661166815513	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.210649288449	Thank you.
0.0	0.423361415622	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.810646700486	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.254269168601	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.365894192525	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.230839668899	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.253810809245	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.6660368627	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
1.0	0.358423876364	That's wrong.
0.0	0.618465672688	Two points.
0.0	0.40668421215	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.798646934918	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
1.0	0.646858077506	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.599895267848	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.844785852223	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.67919531018	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.721883999679	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.378597677041	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.5	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.286298576556	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.330866699994	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.404639625883	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.338288886435	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.160310247605	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.15351271588	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.302123546928	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.368517302832	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.286292378133	We have to do something.
0.0	0.252787794963	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.371514754791	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.143315193143	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.300660178589	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.698443571639	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.697513053152	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.415189535257	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.432064157654	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.575744933869	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.706131002709	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
1.0	0.525119298508	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.34608649226	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.166849034294	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.425832723404	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.400953453043	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.492112302651	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.0881555842007	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.138260803263	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.537703155003	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.608523628818	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
1.0	0.0567751935969	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.317084129244	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.169920957076	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.350251087718	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.243854466674	Dynamically.
0.0	0.299856750856	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.414838869665	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.859229514942	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.59675961506	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.412288584076	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.678510521262	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.310869676289	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.239239040633	I will not do that.
0.0	0.396967056355	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.302200949741	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.300926279901	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.394112618941	Both served.
0.0	0.318410439144	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.535964836296	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.225771036726	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.34620722636	He has never defended...
0.0	0.480365917252	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.206134290449	So you might not.
1.0	0.918253502791	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.212446285576	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.336078117639	Growth is the answer.
1.0	0.936896906773	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.179164479695	We need sound money.
1.0	0.577481948274	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.362667762384	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.433219246699	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.448233354714	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.289422616721	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.5	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
1.0	0.466584227582	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.333501955335	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.242033642862	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.454689543922	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.620210271038	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.250452638304	And we are not England.
0.0	0.155059484227	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.360513615708	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.505327815659	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.108101138089	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.226579829014	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.485372406753	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.647032094996	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.184476711365	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.244487567318	We have no borders.
0.0	0.293564000965	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.333388808863	We are not France.
0.0	0.140660060385	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.457907398403	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.180729806729	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.481393006292	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.542284414436	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.312709226288	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.107831533827	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.222479973671	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.243640304976	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.256318513254	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.272209614435	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.632809105874	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
1.0	0.791806855818	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.275971042351	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.344225259047	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.546257701344	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.290832885304	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.243854466674	Right.
0.0	0.511805288456	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.217764569759	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.507107201573	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.339048130875	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.760767996167	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.298752126156	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.335500621068	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.537051621886	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.115126598008	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.351749941829	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.603568026438	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.172011902648	I like it.
1.0	0.480822472876	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.32049841796	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.186833483269	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.424569249332	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.215542550027	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.323080656736	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.788630887258	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.299442095714	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.291803703323	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.100529742788	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.121309385335	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.976037596676	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.301418663504	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.355552908628	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.368085926435	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.833156440444	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.22047774769	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.0981620696591	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.547595136033	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.458577714011	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.241434030996	No.
0.0	0.269699338265	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.332758972236	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.236264269435	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
1.0	0.341891322825	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.113480941156	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.12856509277	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.122946142997	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.33138176468	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.341330164756	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.211058541251	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.226143801616	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.233512953421	It is a real horror.
1.0	0.901153868312	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.298867552424	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.357575848954	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.520526860451	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.150587725756	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.248836645585	to save a company.
0.0	0.355476186223	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.425777963286	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.355824516305	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.591204580502	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.0314224165464	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.164808922982	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.591135741551	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.839523429341	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
1.0	0.49026771868	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.274834340485	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.216665491079	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.644555564437	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.360228846162	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.465510577698	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.361052242715	That's fine.
0.0	0.685667503911	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.166874819499	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.128070474347	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.215001437106	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.126561917837	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.435559819432	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.139487572057	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.166849034294	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.211882392515	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.416626624632	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.0817871559445	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.398632490197	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.320915123396	You have to lead.
0.0	0.104474754834	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.716401732419	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.158302166282	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.388133788763	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.473539472103	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.359543574907	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.413119874673	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.583709884004	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.168399267089	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.274135455517	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.680366854264	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.147181658901	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.518192782804	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
1.0	0.443334552169	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.274040514136	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.153692797871	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.26450955918	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.116971846385	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.258571896858	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
1.0	0.416747476579	They stole it.
0.0	0.29397391098	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.635508460629	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.300629541928	They're a scam.
0.0	0.368503528373	She was right.
0.0	0.194994261667	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.331018883901	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.200752824852	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.20174625015	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.346737677244	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.200182870203	OK.
0.0	0.619639974018	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.650809656404	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.610661144209	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.662836651011	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.159805705063	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.573268465601	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.5	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.279564807365	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.317792039575	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.382162290447	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.92312029265	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.

0.0	0.740520835035	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.547185468458	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.

0.0	0.275631993407	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.13896424226	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.374579772726	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.584019556024	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.

0.0	0.546234209337	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.

0.0	0.197461787931	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.452835760554	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.321691645913	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.204744372571	And for good cause.
0.0	0.541123280555	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.300910346238	That is not right.
0.0	0.300863699593	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.219035125454	No, it should be repealed.
1.0	0.6476055702	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.447306295477	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.729338766859	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.285078099757	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.68208041624	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.0505768641237	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.449014840217	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.804694498373	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.454947072747	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.477501922321	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.245019265286	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.262995587428	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.536364897634	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.241711513255	That's good.
0.0	0.333266710175	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.830443273033	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.233265872075	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.0989959231501	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.292071315663	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.277298403299	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.

0.0	0.811084914291	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.310828700238	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.143066335488	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.363518573264	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.728996265853	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.119469225343	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.304303599315	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.175403621465	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.399591306646	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.397170615771	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.169094898946	I'd consider it.
1.0	0.690744772797	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
1.0	0.827978232964	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.303998797068	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.403980445753	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.230527393005	The number of women --
0.0	0.164838312059	You looking at me?
0.0	0.735837094727	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.510843308475	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.658571974277	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
1.0	0.168212992611	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.221242060117	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.477181886796	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.339124839488	I will be that new leader.
1.0	0.286686080498	This president is undermining our military.
1.0	0.82756447781	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.280340491959	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.527941881718	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.271911703206	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.733029162941	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.650025043538	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.270974841878	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.195938820519	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.395336134871	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.553899024359	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.241674190622	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.106275712669	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.317699492389	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.298637449193	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
1.0	0.878904910194	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.488641325738	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.269265525586	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.304640581605	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.27356200254	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.550515927278	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.569702313033	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.5	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.348701434918	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.772419415851	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.5	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.214280906505	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.322278808491	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.147725176113	You just want to...
0.0	0.316724199589	On welfare.
0.0	0.32964377345	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.43162529882	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.769490429674	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.641670554126	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.181111836566	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.576042973665	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.362860888979	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.238421259963	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.925502286223	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.168927663635	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.67878268387	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.380763550003	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.25418157009	No, John.
0.0	0.204266231393	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.490296304784	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.297456813734	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.872219843418	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
1.0	0.361433573265	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.320761695339	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.852783244106	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.195340425225	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.257593393291	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.397701912474	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.155685641447	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.195329139586	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.33341019453	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.758829967046	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.722137407422	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.810863264141	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.277562699883	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.204717883076	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.328965672761	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.528809120456	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.711148666373	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.200182870203	Yes.
0.0	0.491556418121	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.353938582583	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.181562662473	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.267167884897	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.594211735687	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.333171436546	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.716410493435	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.131183663796	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.587990630805	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.558200012617	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.262415915149	John.
0.0	0.34361406772	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.339433427526	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.366625502955	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.210985213033	You know why?
0.0	0.677160695929	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.228349724943	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.0709768692339	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.560278636187	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.244165747114	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.334912276038	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.548965535015	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.622342148945	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.432222460572	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.283620609321	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.0163954070454	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.268426792631	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?

0.0	0.5	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.675017213515	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.22125826872	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.236818206629	It never happens.
0.0	0.742215903403	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.605661268339	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.425787834161	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.644267164184	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.277503970097	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.126065640553	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.650590331326	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.375035491283	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.214726545778	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.343380410715	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.774378232352	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.297904204334	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.906535816904	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.123038824852	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.592095184801	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.243854466674	Absolutely.
0.0	0.597259607225	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.407203164131	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.279723223692	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.445086950026	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.660970192647	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.5	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.337387638708	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
1.0	0.797461415032	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.166723707691	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.537434712529	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.162943027103	It feels different.
0.0	0.460621490343	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.699605642916	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.205054485123	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.268084181819	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.354238076638	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.39380869024	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.774297117381	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.235371391014	You're welcome.
0.0	0.379731203934	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.483687367409	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.1956599082	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.702573286728	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.358550409612	I was the architect.
0.0	0.427663869539	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.49077157336	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.234511107059	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.406080636492	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.553955140918	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.304872842234	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.772479129608	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.154349718729	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.661849805205	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.420714043923	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.463085077769	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.0948532752288	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0585516286164	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
1.0	0.404656613609	They were wrong.
0.0	0.288986509358	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.262662478725	I win.
0.0	0.885374439255	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.291364793077	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.561414328071	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.389704409531	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.329584509415	You did.
0.0	0.146399796083	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.391789878124	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.0258960130845	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
1.0	0.311113703461	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.081933059942	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.0610811435057	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.359096554227	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.212366924775	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.161929436599	Why?
0.0	0.437319764036	Just for the record.
0.0	0.258788606176	The answer is no.
0.0	0.395519490844	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.732751727179	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.208949996294	He's wrong.
0.0	0.525111141714	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.344500391804	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.308462017491	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.262595484778	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.283495742651	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.387947720127	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.751180525811	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.0718856468183	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.178217239529	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.239104160023	And, we said no.
0.0	0.599938514956	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.308258956935	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.830830059806	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.443978130963	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.388133788763	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.35045898167	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.536604743425	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.413659165533	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.554663502389	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.148230868508	I would just say that...
0.0	0.308075244609	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.5	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.336804285114	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.36956903914	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.139554860139	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.357715726877	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.247197459416	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.383753459605	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.5	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.293915302299	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.30933169745	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
1.0	0.729996137937	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.518278433344	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.364523934563	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.28128370825	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.294249267905	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
1.0	0.361039792269	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.360862133737	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.292288352824	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.368369520541	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.286550201048	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.653139786732	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.121585225581	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.463485051084	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.538569483266	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.225781736003	My point is this.
