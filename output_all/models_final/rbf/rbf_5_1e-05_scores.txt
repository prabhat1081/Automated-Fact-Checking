0.0	0.488738693163	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.515237190037	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.411883875515	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.403151357962	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.44791528152	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.519159889287	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.404124341855	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.416977267963	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.404551834847	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.520099738742	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.5	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.470426150832	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.439374094964	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.760369161936	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.407976793078	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.506591833974	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.51019393183	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.438475851994	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.423844360659	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.391208394979	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.624924753734	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.40752703633	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.507189705453	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.494831913496	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.439466437548	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.421889053139	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.53537088027	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.389360843171	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.535867974748	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.380727920058	No.
1.0	0.546257457119	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.472835566108	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.562938801967	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.533739133122	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.52263674019	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.442915502138	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.411001393648	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.540546332971	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.551900687219	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.576529326744	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.4138619303	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.586234679822	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.484470291068	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.526780835583	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.650293373525	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.721858081725	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.473327295399	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.392787001455	You really can't.
0.0	0.71037570597	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.521336289761	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.412257072256	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.464173307412	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.41558657656	But here's the real key.
1.0	0.576292048838	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.539948792479	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.449239609366	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.390180636509	Divide that out.
0.0	0.771705068204	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.613365066347	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.423552517574	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.474876705188	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.40082797245	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.584825417007	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.490349887029	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.527299773687	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.573159371195	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.655657033577	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.654160725645	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.406689917214	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.423525104942	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.5	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.41352701475	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.560829714222	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.645350041348	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.737159932652	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.452070916325	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.405900728549	In addition to that...
0.0	0.5	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
1.0	0.50665114371	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.45461041084	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.712430976052	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.517664216424	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.53162753031	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.451500281377	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.415965652871	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.431325504259	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.420018793993	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.552769275425	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.473073427515	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
1.0	0.401794636695	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.489987155634	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.568248913592	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.388910471815	We're running.
0.0	0.581687254875	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.392966053355	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.664470078021	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.59725671078	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.451597871768	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.448141405759	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.419696416142	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.402915874465	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.441956337921	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.494372972667	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.404664165615	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.380193559233	Yes.
0.0	0.397116284829	I can't do it.
0.0	0.455460018888	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.482558568314	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.745267343165	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.557022655578	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.489854005922	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.692073564492	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.407656840143	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.417348974969	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.536893337589	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.392611637115	And God bless America.
0.0	0.407435322074	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.737598330563	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.460191841171	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.473896835438	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.472523182583	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.585903414383	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.538450038745	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.429108879619	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.540817869755	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.600077078105	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.469320957324	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.535990433591	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.410236794146	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.407813424371	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.589385589234	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.539992245708	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.781381712243	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.544516129383	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.52317727761	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.472614825997	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.38342622622	You do.
0.0	0.455433668968	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.609039894866	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.524601120275	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.481165313711	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.46503124916	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.465087019004	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.509153666808	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.420933278013	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.449491360265	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.410594805425	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.401879741512	We have to obey the laws.
1.0	0.5	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.400054611769	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.387650792513	And guess what?
0.0	0.667420971413	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.394649971286	We actually did it.
0.0	0.532773884521	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.452786118718	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.491057016912	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.402210281153	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.390373915748	It never happens.
0.0	0.669042831256	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
1.0	0.607542755694	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.451031548439	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.45752070927	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.460347397208	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.472876017706	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.474617128374	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.39430317868	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.457426304641	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.491377303993	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.415504272898	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.39666859711	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.42755169239	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.479437406805	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.393308862603	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.388428731965	You know that.
0.0	0.404134649907	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.604351319359	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.482803788279	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.436216549834	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.609883488724	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.467537513223	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.540715874732	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.411573372143	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.384304713623	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.42647032031	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.428571130381	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.403288358893	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.419267942901	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.473249801678	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.584169059282	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.683767670876	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.5	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.398186731025	That's not right.
0.0	0.453097428127	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.432705539252	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.389590756581	You get together.
0.0	0.452972795288	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.42087158409	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.582185121789	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.423171023136	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.4515116519	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.408268492688	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.555901791807	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.404323097096	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.690382211096	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.509142782734	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.423207250759	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.406922023865	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.43891213302	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.402134194534	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.506767125804	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.481442905828	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.423035667687	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.422900395856	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.724359003768	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.440179984933	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.427842966206	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.42084039615	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.447788045788	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.443787991903	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.428387084089	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.586188745508	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.514551030073	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.475800264847	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.545008184119	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.711136522803	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.544293514834	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.51991804171	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.454997633376	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.477975357238	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
1.0	0.464425921196	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.524203218246	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.470702078914	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.472929665002	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.828566581146	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
1.0	0.645443763911	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.472616504592	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.491168657403	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.444331568225	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.456752657278	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
1.0	0.562578588639	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.703061703062	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.418737613974	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.583094666412	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.471071117385	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.5	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.434106558909	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.412310840005	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.431974474386	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.428423883487	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.556208590283	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.478707314841	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.429108227651	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.587213343385	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
1.0	0.648290104021	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.600639512295	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.686604812693	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.518970422046	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.396860072933	How great is that?
0.0	0.603760761012	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.539780730962	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.405441034033	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.396677464085	He hit oil.
0.0	0.557372550406	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.489826512511	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.621936942264	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.457313289351	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.56995451099	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.40524768421	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.42372319251	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.507343074339	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.541754995182	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.38039470558	Right.
0.0	0.600534484994	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.444365079551	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.395539170087	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.544604036094	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.445486601533	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.395000339336	This is 2016.
0.0	0.414399851233	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.670090302734	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.45109814844	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.429679296982	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.417351288857	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.54015358634	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.686122220237	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.486747753675	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.463417230106	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.397868996461	She said the truth.
0.0	0.508984818438	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.437023775663	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.488782999427	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.416117244933	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.414516655105	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.43714529655	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.423239610937	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.445128050113	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.447861694942	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.540932462536	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.425911913022	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.417338951362	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.405726019847	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.507057219729	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.458667524254	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.416275001914	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.428208700898	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.485631419358	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.573468912483	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.634244097109	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.467465578788	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.551949551554	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.490623956563	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.547503927268	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.550637280321	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.539255592368	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.460278486437	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.478890418811	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.415376453288	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.520744386096	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.5	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.380193559233	Yes.
0.0	0.433775659355	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.490580990205	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.405001693389	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.521559733984	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.709862781455	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.463864934821	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.390957980568	in particular.
0.0	0.473734803791	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.651873815083	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.386388169451	You know why?
0.0	0.429660488624	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.474874536156	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.426184379743	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.512060574346	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.481792655702	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.438981827078	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.400629218423	That's for sure.
0.0	0.5	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.474827225334	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.513808208638	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.492599031721	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.541966148295	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.465400263798	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.564898598889	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.380727920058	No.
0.0	0.423930106737	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.492261805789	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.408678757246	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.427974593068	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.452223054298	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.5	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.549821593286	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.432646557648	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.439169382203	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.477506251099	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.439245320352	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.419587478098	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.395190857469	Think about that.
0.0	0.577121788742	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
1.0	0.571822048969	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.407025972232	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.444899196269	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.438647733215	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.380727920058	No.
0.0	0.525135004518	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.391501452534	And you know what?
0.0	0.673996327807	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.505284818334	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.569699912261	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.5	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.429297491859	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.591630491155	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.580508271654	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.513252166018	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.732010523045	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.468495495325	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.383199359926	Creativity.
0.0	0.431968621621	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.473643986243	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.523834075646	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.490886268922	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.491253405364	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.438745780775	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.405462490923	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.454348451407	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.438588222639	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.468108721121	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.388938767808	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.573621998563	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.614501069056	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.407875428618	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.459895407855	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.42934769146	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.403997630222	I'm aware of that.
1.0	0.603231228712	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.397627876873	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.470387429383	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.410248990421	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.424772261786	I didn't find it offensive at all.
1.0	0.566560830333	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.416515555426	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.422905100821	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.381679560454	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.443666386836	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.464682943662	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.426137750218	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.387935049913	Check it out.
0.0	0.429016814117	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.391730794012	Came out great.
0.0	0.441470978409	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.476541736309	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.393073773483	That never works.
0.0	0.618631032332	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.441417889479	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.468220489307	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.39272694684	About Medicare?
0.0	0.452981414803	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.700732612007	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.409026265945	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.410205701723	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.556203025945	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.399186752166	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.507553312354	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.49328362802	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.481787685442	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.595859914885	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.419822517885	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.455095699522	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.399063324145	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.44255594385	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.420559644764	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.465001015689	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.5	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.435806934921	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.396145717335	Our next president...
0.0	0.43301624126	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.536408765757	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.527220236586	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.616016978745	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.432005398455	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.5	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.487608970494	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.425406618528	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.393728833633	Why is that?
0.0	0.446962706631	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.601381384099	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.453935035815	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.649261114516	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.493643530038	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
1.0	0.545831185698	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.516945195725	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.524864734865	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.471003218422	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.47260011196	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.391994480014	I don't care.
0.0	0.5	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.506978884482	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.434953335244	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.533678309078	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.514627321032	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.479224092044	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.428888869064	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.476732269175	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.459564174054	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.550092486089	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.580459364733	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.619259076364	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.423144210938	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.588642579512	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.452417639906	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.616674802586	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.405390577621	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.419287442179	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.482970065209	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.567497040544	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.542153000363	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.412142180234	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.449524562379	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.557391903452	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.754619340575	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.434471012528	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.49441563153	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
1.0	0.644635266842	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.518424568379	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.395977636492	How do I know this?
0.0	0.437880420446	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.422987762205	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.456803507142	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.60713872554	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.469203345469	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.605955362289	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.457073825634	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.377417812484	I understand.
0.0	0.460879915249	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.529130822297	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.380727920058	No.
1.0	0.415752181535	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.409331504835	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.416774185575	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.438122604686	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.416890722278	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.670917707185	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.645720748666	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.566451109551	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.412938064415	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.471062448582	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.582917445521	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.487731422267	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.590454865731	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.389300983801	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.438684375507	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
1.0	0.64500325514	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.65998599785	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.394683199661	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.533315488536	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.447102559089	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.461507342718	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.56834697481	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.432960535374	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.419685236945	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.612031372452	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.521350052755	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.440042507591	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.578761897379	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.416234302943	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.483212816554	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.424906568544	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.408703003547	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.479559446295	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.494584135794	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.402151147431	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.430453792293	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.47251162988	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.623858155012	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.492306005357	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.425951878862	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.406775758188	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.708167156008	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.490163310476	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.437771277124	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.455335455656	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.477138124283	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.451748086842	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.429906017541	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.44564274046	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.652504637793	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.388558725963	Well, sure.
0.0	0.476975811891	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.575413129919	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.531547590169	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.5	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.565230411387	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.5	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.422093094174	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.44712446975	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.572445998251	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.438988189245	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.437411580689	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.541043384571	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.492930749731	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.671286301149	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.439959428501	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.395153184557	I got that.
0.0	0.470771296951	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.397866315101	It's a joke.
0.0	0.424785638904	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.432160730875	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.534383300752	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.394065517529	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.441919941023	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.432571243546	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.385283388112	I like that.
0.0	0.508577628526	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.404318425557	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.612631024337	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.451801941559	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.695348271402	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.586469123167	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.507773495571	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.416806253245	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.45427641278	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.594175966614	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.454770525532	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.383955026335	Not bad.
0.0	0.552024071049	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.619176607993	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.57112267637	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.535683628418	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.540292732701	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.474809923053	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.426585216639	They're sick of politics as usual.
1.0	0.751223228161	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.624535099432	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.397978220712	You don't have to.
0.0	0.855301433962	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.448697046325	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.405610857187	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.417109469457	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.529640223478	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
1.0	0.559639997626	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.438122035819	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.480221692665	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.536546060666	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.395553641483	You know why three?
0.0	0.401536196331	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.418126262856	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.415183670161	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.532034024542	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.510601334025	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.485518314631	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.505878235511	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.506276639694	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.512462431016	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.380193559233	Yes.
0.0	0.46882856765	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.387198498912	It was.
0.0	0.62510067004	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.41162706638	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.529160283744	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.639170013814	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.403851871363	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.516859008282	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.686802655572	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.414736732333	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.668635176625	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.646776853743	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.581018032066	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.412687275059	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.395240460749	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.54077824559	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.400269995152	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.414779124346	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.42627452418	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.393070305835	I'll say this.
0.0	0.537805758811	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.420351523243	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.462984969014	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.520758621766	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.619330580347	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.403693288441	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.51769311942	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.738436772131	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.609995155891	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.682139072164	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.39335390242	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.457356816362	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.717351932057	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.405495181014	But I was born here.
0.0	0.426443837293	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.456010175406	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.401080223323	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.630991056765	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.672981358325	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.432270808096	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.482129698298	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.568349104593	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.401179334175	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.606088683048	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.384201153268	It is.
0.0	0.566920691017	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.726059756275	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.473228239483	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.421348971881	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.530007816409	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.404068291665	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.473924570241	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.39224424605	We were wrong.
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.430929990458	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.473633432237	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.480558427803	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.492380348381	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.530065699125	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.435345244894	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.656474085741	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.480465196581	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.397116284829	We can't do it.
0.0	0.393191412355	I think he is right.
0.0	0.831853039653	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.413809308143	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.660934227966	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.436858160794	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.514190497258	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.535533920372	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.536434950598	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.423066559087	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.468710184792	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
1.0	0.601891445488	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.422957546229	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.779765650252	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.586967019267	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.507793196923	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.5	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.432786071053	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.399147824976	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.485633322511	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.406868825597	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.438791288841	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.391501452534	But you know what?
0.0	0.441972789049	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
1.0	0.409031511916	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.559944267475	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.420692821215	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.386414934724	It's true.
0.0	0.388392745271	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.656291135012	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.417409530622	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.485485986149	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.426008881823	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.585300792036	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.459147566499	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.450071642163	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.5	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.441930301426	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.403291370954	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.508198284751	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.446458420948	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.620877266178	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.568274308741	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.52417807963	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.407702596236	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.40965875064	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.418050000172	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.5	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.486072260079	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.4084741529	He is a good man.
0.0	0.398912906982	That has not been...
0.0	0.432155673366	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.619114788251	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.460042150369	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.427055722966	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.585543505989	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.457007239293	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.393861088955	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.436699641224	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.615315092045	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.666177849537	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.407785364202	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.5	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.596503843144	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.639143311016	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.460186632387	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.464297286346	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.522740063438	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.437995188488	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.509047623939	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.475345846472	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.639097439506	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.511637869754	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.421748534153	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.528545832502	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.404067990147	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.561054304083	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.520905145856	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.400687328183	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.52030996123	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.782261843308	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.428035983159	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.483163599629	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.461200474987	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.46426526283	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.464463870334	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.548607943507	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.450756591657	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.572834165008	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.420266261374	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.474530318694	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.535652229372	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.483399488038	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.397983758422	That will change everything.
0.0	0.561547237056	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.406848482603	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.391227959006	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.613248073334	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.696142359663	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.5	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.401463782589	I never said that.
0.0	0.468247260066	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.612049044273	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.417558973073	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.440405853091	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.458788298202	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.398502029384	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.746222539836	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.506601545826	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.395395522247	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.396249273801	That's fine.
0.0	0.623117251699	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.492780732961	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.616350346541	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.531117475097	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.418215875229	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.566598693276	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.5	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.37418898133	...
0.0	0.394193452538	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.40783631702	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.523065104219	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.597825836848	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.426608021738	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.433767872377	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.702988247828	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.445045675482	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.389683652007	They cause dishonesty.
1.0	0.5693178804	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.440354707924	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.483993743124	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.38687463796	You find me...
0.0	0.628574919802	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.468065303773	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.433863666345	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.40586454073	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.5	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.619425699454	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.586385661698	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.430060589021	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.567963439608	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.5	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.432784188823	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.456580406551	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.455104074087	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.669063490443	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.555087772356	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.486751947244	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.508091830295	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.595877246466	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.490891450157	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.549133311772	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.38342622622	I do.
0.0	0.534303297801	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.432411614769	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.4559782029	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.406760845364	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.473941923106	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.433336763735	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.411363398894	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.456834279353	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.462239450156	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.689728848849	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.426168633007	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.397329974654	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.5	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.403297403197	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.474532971256	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.50523676612	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.442366456917	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.488999457116	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.473159739141	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.426726142767	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.463206722672	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.42401514161	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.416654711699	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.425908086491	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.551267065454	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.41917238543	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.471562509442	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.542781549399	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.411935487651	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.491383589656	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.464915408072	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.477647741315	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.5	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.513368828833	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.546876257782	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.385701841655	That is...
0.0	0.402600426118	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.506922650741	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.410893968124	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.477780811644	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.456914058647	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.446979373651	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.399474739859	We're not doing it.
1.0	0.47905225173	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.522457108807	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.469340831753	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.40055170843	Good at email.
0.0	0.47313668972	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.545089264996	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.519706080108	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.528196740478	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.558006422392	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.411419866309	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.407035555665	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.572315996122	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.717858619916	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.615444928147	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.543731769526	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.430998610151	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.411973126343	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.813466678575	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.5174994964	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.5	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.392928279274	Think about it.
0.0	0.380727920058	No.
0.0	0.37418898133	...
0.0	0.491828601244	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.740009747239	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.419198420608	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.428343472666	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.410532250136	He got lucky with fracking.
1.0	0.472114541911	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.414997661774	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.430039944407	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.648172703772	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.528979564636	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.436903525105	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.664708206049	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.396661931029	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.402800043055	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.397301214183	I know every one.
0.0	0.403750686726	That's the difference.
0.0	0.643201532003	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.5	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.391501452534	And you know what?
0.0	0.483470837212	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.463026319509	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.418190878602	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.415647383745	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.748689295219	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.406817450042	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.626820734557	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.411237516406	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.554098569894	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.601369222834	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.510056482555	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.647136947454	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.535233467903	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.394657653562	I've done it.
0.0	0.487795099869	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.44450198166	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.518715724557	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.4913354839	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.63436685873	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.562462231344	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.403837821679	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.392312066806	You bet they do.
0.0	0.400007772336	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.448045972545	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.608510858931	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.607372337106	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.407267066788	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.562718471312	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
1.0	0.479550336993	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.403655081876	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.438013649497	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.404564938482	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.533834158699	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.479728097938	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.440923693299	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.426218099492	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.437412971391	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.490151263468	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.559047531251	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.676266358521	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.406000304275	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.50867222238	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.50699829118	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.675727573668	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.419863571549	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.680244692253	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.643592164531	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.540715874732	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
1.0	0.75064061403	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.452412049331	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.432603473868	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.490990313144	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.385978042634	I want security.
0.0	0.461869077971	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.419891724164	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.558933615465	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.450596897254	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.603857162429	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.445743867539	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.490235839537	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.558473905852	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.437791817912	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.570837694321	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.

0.0	0.75644596404	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.695972371004	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.708949744235	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.

0.0	0.589154774052	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.422707790147	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.39454510349	Wait for what?
0.0	0.5	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.

0.0	0.397708278808	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.570468223572	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.442192199507	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.57094920051	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.400962189498	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.417163752595	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.642137904273	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.535931727524	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.416000867534	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.552830699857	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.421098138052	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.528451656739	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.553553126967	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.415190722921	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.444320697267	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.490514024179	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.756239480356	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.41716721878	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.447423481457	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.602600001134	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.43263675144	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.49499923733	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.565378862727	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.475510779458	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.459907957546	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.455588755065	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.437197262595	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.42395645915	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.378514512533	But...
0.0	0.463577862548	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.417711159513	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.546747166206	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.475561613182	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.460400505575	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.4032636569	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.409683372637	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.46776974029	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.480705197544	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.395283975204	I changed that.
0.0	0.472036138211	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.489988796838	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.539495681007	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.40292846706	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.582171355343	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.38039470558	Ever.
0.0	0.51750095327	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.438609616884	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.513709063674	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.

0.0	0.4269478531	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.467602577627	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.5	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.380745209599	Neil...
0.0	0.567876238279	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.439238926955	That's not the America that I've ever known.

0.0	0.517794339039	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.399994543799	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.528463730024	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.5	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.418594131285	That's how you solve the problem.

0.0	0.529638308902	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.517804413526	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.449248851113	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.439069608518	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.482254055352	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.380727920058	No.

0.0	0.630214762265	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.5691787707	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.403609021531	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.586396539525	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.417862904307	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.565379598283	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.475028492779	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.422804798995	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.388392745271	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.398464790148	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.39623197742	That's not true.
0.0	0.431934267102	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.39511308672	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.543183916391	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.594088609204	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.407477898502	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.435636702953	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.384507605354	I love China.
0.0	0.444422594744	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.387856545039	He undermines it.
0.0	0.431390047935	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.427093711132	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.421278718918	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.409089973055	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.491715071015	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.426039863576	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.769857323665	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.416229755388	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.510980619485	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.454026682346	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.394822780986	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.433289631033	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.492161855202	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.467075296078	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.399010476766	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.460108437421	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.535171890586	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.42569264983	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.379671000678	So...
0.0	0.491378089996	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.429034736409	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.461467656544	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.612465864566	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.518758876462	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.479574030645	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.398619517565	I have no idea.
0.0	0.392746709935	We don't win.
0.0	0.711786500341	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.466133759024	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.443364624151	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.421427182254	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.534417787733	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.489905924299	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.457824990336	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.505791240922	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.653459102487	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.594808864526	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.47503430706	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.52812941445	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.413985593793	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.439046362454	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.510966654228	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.493746310571	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.417109469457	It's driving up stock prices.
1.0	0.402479087407	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.732629011381	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
1.0	0.452483329431	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.443342542298	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.473065387425	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.411173231842	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.400576221252	Do we still have standards?
1.0	0.431252406795	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.644816111391	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.586002167754	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.444654910983	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.674398899126	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.475420156506	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.391538059895	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.647075833276	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.51228384917	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
1.0	0.475425882625	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.443022771126	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.703001140891	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.439668319544	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.636495099356	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.553927016037	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
1.0	0.573947348434	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.400173725854	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.424418626156	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.553813602989	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.537245659609	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
1.0	0.604889132238	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.607270194669	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.441313971599	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.522739924973	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.40705970337	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.528525843364	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.411881197137	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.505107547843	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.450660755555	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.543065092437	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.455256900226	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.487826804759	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.53116146655	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.635807059412	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.428115555473	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.553663490581	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.440228187983	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.5	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.515990717805	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.688855091092	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.41003529112	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.629431965577	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.48651914026	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.435986318759	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.601161472987	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.397429770411	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.455199071864	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.594143897372	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.583917689273	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
1.0	0.463527799799	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.438183389778	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.490658816413	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.5	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.541232023218	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.617803560378	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.579316592404	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.530158885497	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.483287582635	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.55496754013	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.50978641883	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.448673702449	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.401686124736	My background is different.
0.0	0.403012073215	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.390240722615	I would change them.
0.0	0.435866907727	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.51876857938	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.521116360126	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.484004742015	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
1.0	0.55495549161	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.559024857423	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.41825805295	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.618460766111	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.

0.0	0.465333749641	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.399147824976	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.594611000257	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.417995114505	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.490390982214	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.473612153608	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.706395769775	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.480232570228	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
1.0	0.591268874578	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.5	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.

0.0	0.52612155724	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.460782820811	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.491568512172	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.602792354422	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
1.0	0.430397686368	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.465857776654	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.538032573375	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.423200148777	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.631284504711	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.

0.0	0.392928279274	Think about it.
0.0	0.439382944938	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.468062334014	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.461074862023	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.409449802451	Now, you've got Europe.

0.0	0.558163961499	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.430024203972	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.486688110601	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.

0.0	0.70107343907	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.401722456017	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.60719723119	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.

0.0	0.533438420926	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.401522875885	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.421391662374	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.391800181897	OK, good.
0.0	0.494334364243	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.404631211549	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.54734764857	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.43254607642	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.441433494652	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.742474951882	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.516133394541	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.739514600041	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.39443345855	So you know what?
0.0	0.413427436757	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.75266270991	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.520476874251	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.438938680377	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.441585676169	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.431348845139	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.493536623809	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.535159051292	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.450542895231	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.550836138145	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.606965405148	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.436877587135	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.509412458581	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.395779859124	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.546166364415	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
1.0	0.608476979334	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.45018844578	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.38342622622	We do.
0.0	0.513800256796	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.399600412483	It's their money.
0.0	0.391501452534	And you know what?
0.0	0.729111620086	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.467158191616	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.462983734126	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.530062134714	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.51124325303	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.404722772657	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.442582198971	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.5	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.5	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.665669626225	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.694559399245	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.431543467846	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.537202352903	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.5	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.486631576982	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.625677734327	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.583977188226	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.443594345347	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.491587462281	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.39498266917	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.427303184025	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.493179901775	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.537973507946	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.505727785047	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.431619503825	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.757908001991	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.463249923746	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.

0.0	0.441849283489	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.448499175264	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.486437104502	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.392492957462	You want to fix Medicare?

0.0	0.461067483365	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.385675753914	...Chris...
0.0	0.587018303125	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.528551476687	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.507108015957	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.459301732145	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.418280576884	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.710166189009	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.424658271114	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.54309983111	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.515643559071	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.423014653177	And our economy was growing like crazy.
1.0	0.48645587575	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.405188367728	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.506588998536	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.398341207963	No, it's true.
0.0	0.441966223514	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.571931529636	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.451567310793	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.526939339977	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.446966552184	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.611670369132	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.

0.0	0.430817266102	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.654880626405	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.469914167694	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.551864421512	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.38975147435	White people?
0.0	0.429022902203	First of all, yes, we've stolen.

0.0	0.620555142484	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.452786598842	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.412746089889	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.57131823649	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.5	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.516419304854	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.468387589588	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.600114862481	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.455873252295	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.436455781825	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.507856063721	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.527729286453	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.742127178497	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.415734209016	He was on the board.
0.0	0.407383440933	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.455967892451	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.421042400226	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.525436843793	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.563454684798	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.447996371439	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.468008148142	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.400999277199	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.416139630413	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.445295165441	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.489121485499	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.438026425626	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.404719078749	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.5	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.398186731025	That's not right.
0.0	0.631791447864	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.389590756581	You're right.
0.0	0.48975666165	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.392596216193	No, no.
0.0	0.683864239046	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.

0.0	0.414142890333	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.526077224756	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.534051279945	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.60937604031	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.402905459291	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.643175346388	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.411958462577	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.397669811149	But I would add this.
0.0	0.388907800503	This will end.
0.0	0.640633237322	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.54576501486	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.48973549552	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.395142331282	That's right.
0.0	0.474373709523	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.689422606208	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.392399309076	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.441512017672	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.577177254181	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.661062276134	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.514635478918	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.445767812092	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.463521478144	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.5	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.391196098535	And so do I.
0.0	0.41955202398	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.447669580076	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.572519851317	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.509967964694	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.531352963896	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.5	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.386608071798	...Thank you.
0.0	0.524559842944	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.5	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.576016552591	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.5	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.421790449575	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.471954854111	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
1.0	0.486230972747	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.396903722991	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.418523351373	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.467483536639	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.440006695302	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.389305247051	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.43682876638	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.557690682039	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.398194780012	That's my view.
0.0	0.446939508568	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.689776878722	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
1.0	0.62144647719	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.444637944295	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.557782449782	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.478143584679	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.558456303924	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.42836591275	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.563723676319	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.400674012694	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.425332343605	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.437837958665	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.52444705883	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.415096207214	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.42235691524	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.40756359379	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.610388386472	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.612326248333	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.434049541605	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.450387937728	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.429067118045	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.472511555924	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.648132465373	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.473627135563	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.492994726764	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.404745875803	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
1.0	0.5	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.707833506762	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.493469592647	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.513224108189	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.527642168366	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.425312863066	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.438574037794	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.485710713556	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.452778729555	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.578018503819	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.391937354793	What should we do?
0.0	0.442430316136	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.563848066205	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.52565743744	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.451378715446	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.392467554115	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.44477045115	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.380193559233	OK.
0.0	0.457065103063	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.410334208004	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.399797385628	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.582415597454	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.754782694964	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.493517175008	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.518818696725	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.380193559233	OK?
0.0	0.485525899696	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.398089700914	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.416494420309	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.456850649264	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.627261406235	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.451198676387	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.425660370982	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.463417740467	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.423750979349	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.481083711597	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.44635040054	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.41118886537	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.457457932076	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.521321941651	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.391501452534	And you know what?
0.0	0.401668928298	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.401463782589	I never said that.
0.0	0.44902994292	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.426426662895	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.5	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.398880927163	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.409052496985	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.823080160302	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.559541359535	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.446506257992	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.624006031483	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.398613203554	A brief response.
0.0	0.5	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.553388667882	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.420856349785	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.601255874155	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.430182344601	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.514842283734	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.457215717174	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.515774902753	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.548820644615	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.396544442776	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.548043296922	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.458011741066	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.5	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.58260704504	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.393374692094	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.603066914743	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.540116544776	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.436802091255	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.564656119186	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.71904864179	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.448437469144	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.396037231617	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.541384982214	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.411524418921	I was not at all.
0.0	0.411007863179	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.389258902928	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.461358087235	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.418268039147	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.411403788295	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.626626464652	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.583973776428	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.550384151215	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.403053467156	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.661488762725	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.424724698141	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.475306550411	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.418297772063	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.433358933222	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.452501138273	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.679943505194	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.409265264776	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.769493036406	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.701960964778	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.422618762908	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.517855329543	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.475000580967	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.393753635926	I said no.
0.0	0.542600475907	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.806578539016	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.565390021525	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.482492111945	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.414472308633	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.412269707563	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.404638375374	The world has changed.
0.0	0.420083205366	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.659479896797	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.383345587825	I promise.
0.0	0.5	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.5	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.475034594831	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.490212189422	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.5	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.

0.0	0.435013709022	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.64960445366	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.411679782117	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.636172523575	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.407589168457	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.436083687295	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.527391517082	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.5	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.584000662998	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.422044792918	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.423779151874	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.418758466474	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.445731314841	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
1.0	0.671914362125	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.518020710249	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.419081082531	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.409899298484	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.429481804961	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.5	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.705123582785	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.437001043833	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.480941332433	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.539380503346	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.610934759924	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.537262916607	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.393228837285	We don't need that.
0.0	0.5	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.701165803771	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.465174751392	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.448838518041	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.423307934427	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.571795736368	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.426778375975	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.494482444471	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.47880251435	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.438848252159	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.396510452951	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.403164607111	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.442657042167	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.645434881453	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.425174913513	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.577577208716	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.585472521892	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.494049419682	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.584635244485	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.468861640046	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.5	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.450989837635	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.509392254676	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.478647673969	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.436212180239	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.517643335318	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.571426941739	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.471171463794	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.571253751933	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.441866723565	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.377453501744	See?
0.0	0.645367328815	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.589281076603	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.437722355507	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.629590799275	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.483264078311	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.421934030136	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.505019248808	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.396006659499	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.43348512925	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.41109364896	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.402334024813	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.411079837985	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.544276142827	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.458075935008	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.488276824258	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
1.0	0.453392057721	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.601301032406	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.67757503969	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.633143182679	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.484573600086	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.39992060541	You do the arithmetic.
1.0	0.774583481151	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.5594552737	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.473399112122	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.449425513227	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.436811571396	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.63473696727	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.420029331735	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.657333267444	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.531856229705	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.414424769296	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.490560398861	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.433438112474	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.417086873015	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.4348105545	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.454314233269	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.647916723759	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.612997289479	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.5	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.596420035616	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.459970190114	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.665913474161	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.541420975916	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.398746816259	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.668791326866	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.569038309575	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.727114232384	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.412391029188	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.515154155926	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.453119851153	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.485202073181	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.487396160726	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.492031360105	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.471598165516	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.418512121594	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.50548250442	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.479517734198	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.434352326817	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.407741620175	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.473977877062	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.385675753914	...John...
0.0	0.480097727782	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.454197626625	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.444504594659	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.5	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.476096625247	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.386453058857	We need security.
0.0	0.558665058975	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
1.0	0.479899719413	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.564205480148	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.407017469341	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.433384819302	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.397285274429	And here's why.
0.0	0.539361995849	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.420333684864	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.469474649526	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.719901749976	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.455201656031	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.572782665915	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.464655773568	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.5	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.435414009354	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.505000684686	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.513625655969	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.578450917335	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.618276052867	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.401679161255	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.458805103979	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.463541408081	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.639342069779	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.439274688686	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.462501355923	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.508298318551	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.434481300697	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.74547132561	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.420635458038	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.5320214176	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.537643198789	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.392766080489	How about this?
0.0	0.475748348727	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.430808788061	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.435308194634	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.464442032328	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.389854656657	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.738552388103	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.424077241428	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.414007764418	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.551860056501	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.465442953706	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.

0.0	0.531285378318	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.488625233054	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.418884285993	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.465111722156	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.436312124045	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.411552684236	Let's talk about our campaigns.
1.0	0.687328417575	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.486466251718	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.687295482609	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.560238869163	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.526871361156	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.403746552523	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.512983457373	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.417915730012	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.609431846729	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.52668519266	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.477871457742	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.380003796596	These...
0.0	0.415377101877	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.5	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.674663321599	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.380727920058	No.
0.0	0.658846444221	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.40779575084	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.528171988523	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.395822838144	I've laid out...
0.0	0.511073136725	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.392376819154	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.611897818819	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.417506210349	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.521646752434	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.419868789063	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.402695938751	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.398639054489	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.439279497768	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.407100402634	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.44509935284	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.616364176857	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.440243363907	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.427991011517	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.437784423294	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.584095553097	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.453683715658	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.445370975922	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.412030888725	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.426486753573	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.531223094688	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.48348233663	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.460281259398	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.472694462866	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.523343756387	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.533248286286	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.38039470558	Absolutely.
0.0	0.5	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.434683694253	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.412537488002	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.417023784022	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.446247042716	That's why I ask for your support for president.
1.0	0.416753656743	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.562853723863	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.625166762177	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.545056487828	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.456571264272	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.621944446732	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.479767161711	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.417409813286	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.49336118007	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.420998878381	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.527252688132	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.551132023857	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.639857818832	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.392841195422	We need sound money.
0.0	0.409988400845	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.491992690354	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.419943823931	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.427180789818	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.510597441016	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.438321178627	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.572428689264	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.546593915253	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.44494714923	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.404717885241	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.600587062739	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.544938497713	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.467708757795	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.481714323956	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.465314919224	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.399628406932	...income tax...
0.0	0.51237723317	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
1.0	0.634311282186	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.43873657451	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.426345026158	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.40044605645	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.58457538097	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.431619503825	But if you look at working men and women.
1.0	0.542877369394	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.431199477614	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.399474739859	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.429539065427	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.526038905954	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.475443297039	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.52843047186	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.418140076932	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.415603480409	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.42732280779	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.706692875633	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.509690723451	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.458468242079	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.421662791249	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.413621698563	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.42618223108	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.483298182979	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.467291686265	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.620673914458	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.434534116295	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.475117877119	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.450118498056	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.468263195342	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.446268030855	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.471459223746	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.572765892693	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.581546421215	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.591949937891	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.534278434112	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.422911073279	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.45978899002	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.535349023635	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.602241283281	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.394108337784	I love this country.
0.0	0.404868920158	In all due respect...
0.0	0.449836588742	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.485809978998	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
1.0	0.409057384394	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.403277378212	I get to respond, right?

1.0	0.487555382826	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.563100309737	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.726888551152	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.43068417194	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.611538797923	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.457900896253	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.491417475052	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.417722317964	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.538674222388	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.37418898133	...
0.0	0.546038906565	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.450158552831	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.46790692149	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.441830371102	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.554330161882	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.454155667191	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.413619577066	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.736691904468	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.393401038102	I didn't.
0.0	0.398128316169	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.437733768546	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.53266718815	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.480121072716	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.401770246412	This country is changing.
0.0	0.487346441562	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.45914314278	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.594147385661	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.446657084791	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.436405299943	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.474898223578	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.490971382314	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.469515725366	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.479137650571	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.477912696045	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.573518891037	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.437221499576	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.488451468899	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.619962940433	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.428569794888	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.425695314696	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.532417914347	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.625688086337	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.393228837285	They don't like that.
0.0	0.448567949297	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.390002702302	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.415208776764	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.416063745005	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.403431240165	She voted for it.
0.0	0.433926559823	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.445876996833	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.409590343476	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.473333534225	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.423161854244	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.437975573605	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.664082310572	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.433932318897	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.590623448954	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.403624648632	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.432646557648	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.414518833514	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.538968965152	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.514046682085	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.398738209752	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.414610434228	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.474677334052	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.471392149253	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.547074033635	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
1.0	0.446176507626	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.481397151302	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.585903414383	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.487888331579	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.431138849073	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.434517009853	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.471170617039	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.480391393086	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.596354538006	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.456562272725	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.40051356536	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.405667651992	They're off to China.
0.0	0.570605592041	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.521173081002	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.398472757991	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.413122513262	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.412832253778	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.627805663128	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.449116223411	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.627969548598	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.492027968068	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.477035918214	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.574462337898	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.452087809182	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.38342622622	I have.
0.0	0.614014146074	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.730358553418	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.483848408104	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.476334975563	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.566621469893	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.388356043941	We're running.
0.0	0.4763732951	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.557355244513	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.430200885048	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.62177119727	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.456269119827	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.442888399927	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.611674485064	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.524203218246	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.595172111953	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.490714268608	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.456877350462	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.493056320837	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.564727800242	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.477065821868	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.530783629357	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
1.0	0.702349350686	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.409662136635	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.467482604579	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.440150571314	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.400443206981	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.424414848923	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.490476041652	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.477171566811	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.454064107469	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.530385871068	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.598753340662	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.409385628792	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.472406391323	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.474498719722	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.5	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.40785355889	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.400763511348	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.554210648723	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.427806288776	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.383570244219	I can.
0.0	0.455206748442	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.461207956882	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.391011575806	You can have him.
0.0	0.436865936386	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.5	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.573039996636	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.514202652247	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.46037147856	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.427126048073	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.418617674012	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.380193559233	Yeah.
0.0	0.46592088487	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
1.0	0.56779529602	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.561054386047	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.421522100285	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.412523016598	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.474873871291	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.526048448012	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.442553942545	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.482902798236	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.415939713959	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.409766424108	Eleven points, to be exact.
1.0	0.535586101427	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.515774360838	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.409175934251	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.576269679081	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.401815074889	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.519019733711	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.458868620911	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.623426860934	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.395153084512	That's what we need.
0.0	0.438575220744	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.421910866573	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.489750612816	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
1.0	0.449865520122	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.560910971725	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.521847503708	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.510423050864	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.587713906968	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.584814329028	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.40876249925	So we need new leadership -- yes.
1.0	0.478789991528	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.513038338644	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.426365741683	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.602685900741	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.531707945097	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.40104430116	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.471793176056	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.756996916399	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.527233967905	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.391501452534	And you know what?
0.0	0.493505862751	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.654008007208	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.646810542107	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.458426590476	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.483543357956	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.534339713406	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.567270693861	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.49342796437	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.380193559233	Yeah.
0.0	0.480509955493	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.532709346249	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.4578446888	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.489785080905	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.583856808313	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.389380087244	He's wrong.
0.0	0.484175043151	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.413876142708	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.407433002313	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.465666406263	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.401846422952	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.38506465965	And why?
0.0	0.470397665767	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.571915803024	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.428772447462	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.479270554811	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.711764664277	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.400272876788	They're a scam.
0.0	0.608226626019	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.475050175047	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.580530306999	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.623033686833	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.470701022852	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.442437686333	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.38039470558	Right.
0.0	0.427788032365	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.462653286277	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.520379424284	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.412987620812	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.42869315297	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.51562389319	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.472066507116	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.519069008446	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.619899832595	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.406315667896	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.422319068173	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.491294767853	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.474345750901	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.405604919451	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.397226915654	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.545831185698	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.648482894439	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
1.0	0.542377395043	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.399333377248	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.542865945229	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.5	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
1.0	0.588896143924	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.39452699964	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.381470214122	John?
0.0	0.5	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.391987825215	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.463616448231	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.410932623855	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.414385930877	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.474186804413	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.3867818803	But look...
0.0	0.45630587763	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.50718079777	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.41199308575	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.395511146747	You're simply not.
0.0	0.474340516967	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.405535713689	That's what I said.
0.0	0.402437301319	That's what he is.
0.0	0.399734902646	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.412754488639	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.450853799137	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.434275408969	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.579260761984	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.494741004307	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.526874674786	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.545938967282	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.568508713927	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.426048150276	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.415424796249	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.393070305835	I will do that.
0.0	0.705701918897	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.718418231431	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.435245992216	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.402165443745	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.452234569885	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.483769569006	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.442149171622	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.39962063299	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.406517030653	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.452280591686	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.562440315747	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.419633684002	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.416572551533	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.41744373201	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.55147397524	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.795817881562	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.525474526249	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.407292779542	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.59619461311	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.457951841864	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.514872863169	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.472432780266	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.480222587969	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.381470214122	Alright.
0.0	0.422016108641	The guns don't pull the trigger.

0.0	0.392920281615	No their not.
0.0	0.445072709165	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.442441496977	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.393184735811	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.5645533785	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.505497200927	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.453511192009	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.451997908661	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.5	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.42158009668	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.380068966865	Illegal.
0.0	0.508975775489	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.699480779581	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.612617135695	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.735001686769	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.40404014496	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.436444547431	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.490526878217	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.50584020177	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.485040179542	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
1.0	0.606105209593	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.576884184303	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.431417183714	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.473116151355	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.382698533604	I have...
0.0	0.475109445145	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.411752394642	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.44755088163	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.536236782715	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.710151271868	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.436767503412	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.451237148556	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.406635210944	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.434846467166	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.678998455555	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.634418197291	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.531595795459	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.402636624356	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.480449845421	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.445984847473	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.726195825807	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.424524049634	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.577337397856	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.531058995075	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.

0.0	0.451173877708	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.527151029024	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.533939168327	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.585964608324	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.408326133139	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.632177061924	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.

0.0	0.663877027078	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.703463183246	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.519588001406	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.451600672064	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.

0.0	0.480696380545	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.

0.0	0.5	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.

0.0	0.414521891221	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.571515480706	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.483660563706	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.466495662925	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.402367055876	That's my bill.
0.0	0.57512858081	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.465674691729	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
1.0	0.459538844478	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.443943767586	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.45353975756	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.53779078408	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.645004928325	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.523234059789	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.5	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.477026371345	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.398445035594	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.575407159481	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.423745591481	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.4642799317	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.478992325393	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.463249321422	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.409462855502	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.408152863849	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.805913104335	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.472437198051	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.407823994035	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.702497176993	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.402002405603	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.527697192322	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.468899144599	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.512366962334	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.614329200586	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.68282957203	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.389652367748	Big difference.
0.0	0.5	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.663336712449	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.412134909146	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.407696846243	No vision at all.
0.0	0.532270937263	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.406938174392	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.522237711208	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.544838434835	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.732293723288	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.406238413421	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.395344509732	I agree with them.
0.0	0.414519613121	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.407208468881	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.411484563117	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.393228837285	I don't like that.
0.0	0.524912568612	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.512642064512	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.463065354051	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.428677783802	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.398269428492	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.537961050777	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.43151124778	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.526395217444	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.400674354781	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.678517490428	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.715525812399	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.5	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.434919669101	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.473081181229	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.704104268453	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.5	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.709173296551	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.397779183638	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.422704904376	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.604666733229	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.476861407188	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.440192825819	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.380193559233	Okay.
0.0	0.527367533665	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.41872971942	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.414319817341	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.769855877537	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.422629466032	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.515783854874	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.462110383026	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.445519620536	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.751662724031	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.416375226963	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.444313251081	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.457848586107	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.60755583698	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.5	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.635974841091	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.424499043128	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.474471116304	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.463013892845	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.445520813786	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.428527078027	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.568223914512	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
1.0	0.590352082692	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.402376067818	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.44421151691	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.433267498701	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.430674271863	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.459595823698	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.570052582828	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
1.0	0.597578503246	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.5	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.592751103913	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
1.0	0.467123503991	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.385675753914	...Chris...
0.0	0.40694934491	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.528355868743	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.548679749554	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
1.0	0.429848445234	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.450607154168	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.532290368318	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.552490708964	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.587848433874	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.5	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.607880643193	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.576054659881	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.480409431943	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.449381410176	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.49002795943	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.51582238167	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.445319298568	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.528483690011	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.469235923929	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.414789933213	I want security for this country.
1.0	0.637664409201	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.441041333316	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.449883818575	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.526802437737	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.565352401988	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.430562191406	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.448960474238	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
1.0	0.43734034274	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
1.0	0.420351476194	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.860586248633	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.429540477586	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.402711510932	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.466650855117	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.429301013642	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.668613922291	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.44242227128	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.526468894389	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.381679560454	Thank you.
0.0	0.483875941316	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.5	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.442199988989	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.416802642238	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.493669209462	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.413039352713	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.48854755301	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
1.0	0.391628523051	That's wrong.
0.0	0.394337728	Two points.
0.0	0.416998171473	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.5	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
1.0	0.485045838038	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.47665502691	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.613552440418	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.529083716155	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.456506776611	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.436808691203	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.59611491842	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.430482317462	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.620354272241	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.516551768647	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.490325176987	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.413483873887	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.464007118359	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.403705862202	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.439285387737	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.400859297431	We have to do something.
0.0	0.5	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.464365791149	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.432642674025	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.453266561916	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.445426463345	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.545161292716	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.454398738736	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.568379785902	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.509164659552	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.560719849188	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
1.0	0.462300183036	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.414175816872	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.46454385755	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.572271418107	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.580688397901	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.416058430893	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.389271974821	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.427256083884	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.656604064115	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.458329900261	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
1.0	0.770744790716	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.423911811476	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.647358659644	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.736226856808	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.38039470558	Dynamically.
0.0	0.394733824535	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.688917184323	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.419194906199	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.518950754169	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.454077540398	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.5	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.508402444482	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.399303820375	I will not do that.
0.0	0.459854616862	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.408854617671	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.401941953367	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.38939074975	Both served.
0.0	0.519337610481	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.472554289971	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.475412903603	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.396740250551	He has never defended...
0.0	0.61519410837	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.397013848535	So you might not.
1.0	0.545629929427	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.50544435815	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.405751257386	Growth is the answer.
1.0	0.588114980884	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.392841195422	We need sound money.
1.0	0.449797967562	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.530452135841	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.438298122083	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.431520908545	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.47601300422	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.479470314429	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
1.0	0.42989603607	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.5	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.704973203528	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.425886898618	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.51237774638	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.40197436388	And we are not England.
0.0	0.507703772995	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.5	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.689129495286	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.630985211445	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.401364405865	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.494900724713	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.5	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.534055143846	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.397813446613	We have no borders.
0.0	0.701043140772	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.396905906496	We are not France.
0.0	0.575007121631	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.449878325452	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.441135938502	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.458191552344	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.418301957582	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.511323539258	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.512175734656	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.455838654016	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.460329239874	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.4705416457	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.468581203198	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.464971154771	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
1.0	0.520927060653	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.434904632834	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.42660733002	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.408488353356	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.403082330867	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.38039470558	Right.
0.0	0.528823233287	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.436801488281	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.584089937903	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.43604184799	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.58895320105	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.676594882372	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.465889994704	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.442010274531	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.610589072389	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.44172451842	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.480484584268	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.38166496608	I like it.
1.0	0.446952712346	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.467564261701	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.409806934245	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.635751803907	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.526113667953	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.517557368916	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.591978473863	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.486397520991	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.428874194438	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.489222914423	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.5	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.4835404637	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.429268272353	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.689818626448	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.478308690668	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.590670693451	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.420027647396	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.69283936299	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.470910568067	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.419249666342	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.380727920058	No.
0.0	0.435043680802	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.45844415659	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.477701174867	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
1.0	0.392492068837	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.695695622008	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.659073645833	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.46880457574	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.406397286227	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.418952318854	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.427842263487	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.406452289462	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.404511502094	It is a real horror.
1.0	0.573004454012	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.575992408171	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.405042136709	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.468697826033	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.423597381738	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.399641602936	to save a company.
0.0	0.466998519356	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.449518494611	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.41072161585	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.52511062757	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.450293915007	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.494450585966	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.728016643425	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.613788175289	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
1.0	0.436996422206	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.428594050071	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.415284557435	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.521024386576	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.407175393796	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.428481107666	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.396249273801	That's fine.
0.0	0.643481886317	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.399619758791	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.399030080171	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.394091512249	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.461116477453	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.457330620919	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.399730264805	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.46454385755	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.589578852973	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.4862693514	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.706336961949	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.46776020056	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.392202260518	You have to lead.
0.0	0.480912362026	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.764400782846	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.391571490546	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.394498729234	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.483499678105	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.437636431227	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.410087119818	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.450879156039	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.456499973083	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.395891031017	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.581007743758	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.438570102029	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.616118339177	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
1.0	0.408609702915	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.431628984487	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.482789136508	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.626273865765	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.544099980359	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.429436604731	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
1.0	0.391266566658	They stole it.
0.0	0.42484090271	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.549794848459	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.400206962982	They're a scam.
0.0	0.393401038102	She was right.
0.0	0.418864234276	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.410434377884	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.687919549228	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.488660234281	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.458396238802	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.380193559233	OK.
0.0	0.481889007942	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.668225275326	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.5	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.628259771099	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.540934984123	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.472384049935	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.404745875803	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.407286631778	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.413503737948	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.403774639248	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.667590384387	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.492588450906	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.443636820478	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.575319932193	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.562188007776	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.505114724624	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.560617947628	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.434686694399	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.426485875856	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.487684617649	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.505640085782	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.425153610735	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.387935049913	Check it out.
0.0	0.409201645965	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.379671000678	Again...
0.0	0.380745209599	Maria...
0.0	0.443066551155	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
1.0	0.5	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.452124793342	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.479069533851	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.41685813581	We will win on everything we do.

0.0	0.780584017141	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.411506271459	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.420215637632	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.436946303023	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.

0.0	0.524559842944	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.63117748597	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.416995133153	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.43447174451	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.402360492564	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.553598958071	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.

0.0	0.48463233819	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.

0.0	0.435631559291	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.398186731025	That is not right.

0.0	0.61961625407	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.462010718425	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.594400337834	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.46958131011	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.5	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.428539977045	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.523212690936	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.423491722511	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.470291451512	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.48930791019	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.391818353658	That's good.

0.0	0.625795447192	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.41906308424	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.77545584061	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.

0.0	0.584664158416	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.493129477939	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.599611966165	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.41264184504	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.424799911257	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.494983407938	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.441048058595	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.484686186951	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.387981164914	I'd consider it.
1.0	0.698020492144	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
1.0	0.5	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.444505743114	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.633060491927	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.409889343425	The number of women --
0.0	0.398899008264	You looking at me?
0.0	0.579477084626	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.406875188631	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.5	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
1.0	0.5	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.435927508371	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.463042585424	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.410763820921	I will be that new leader.
1.0	0.417855201858	This president is undermining our military.
1.0	0.645882138579	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.41913628255	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.543746861059	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.395315355976	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.446568065669	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.510125205406	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.509232594147	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.478890418811	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.478811073804	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.416924284724	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.5	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.683762147094	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.516244770016	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.514025187003	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
1.0	0.444342573989	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.478665794755	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.522367629025	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.566079057791	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.413635673953	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.450633757627	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.585400806264	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.583586770278	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.457404051757	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.5	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.440621678928	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.556293671957	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.458378862635	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.387470378608	You just want to...
0.0	0.394168746566	On welfare.
0.0	0.627227777716	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.453675531975	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.475866147133	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.486779281588	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.414581246139	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.441331875917	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.42717135015	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.401279127593	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.509129332565	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.5	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.461614871111	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.407684695511	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.393357002379	No, John.
0.0	0.629130043282	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.447880118258	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.470881454951	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.666979311157	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
1.0	0.748645423249	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.5	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.688272787188	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.580173896176	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.436591752154	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.49448393619	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.574472610692	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.51089011468	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.594057258466	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.411937459869	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.5	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.48633598879	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.402915874465	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.586192692838	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.524780144463	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.428121511652	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.508207184275	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.380193559233	Yes.
0.0	0.5	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.5	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.468094513568	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.458825393922	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.588906358135	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.4054962588	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.71453492195	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.524960378354	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.49110023208	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.455686803335	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.381470214122	John.
0.0	0.589802347585	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.5	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.440013202295	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.386388169451	You know why?
0.0	0.622052841708	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.481332390224	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.715022799196	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.666733468773	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.512546530211	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.460738393828	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.430183815218	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.760651682167	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.389813220307	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.51681598877	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.664804861368	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.44763415336	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.482925862057	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.473808571431	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.531343696044	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.480036533904	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.467365368899	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.473133808938	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.397978276295	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.399344322685	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.5	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.505966028469	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.44509935599	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.459279093862	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.591375012688	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.507282007456	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.417660471292	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.516278796452	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.479316762114	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
1.0	0.449663786493	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.442424757918	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.458468242079	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.5	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.443063756695	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
1.0	0.462420449639	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.471446551589	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.492125031909	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.

0.0	0.41827231249	Well, the deal was done.
1.0	0.458425965328	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.618407829959	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.408867084536	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.766386534611	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.451750661876	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.

0.0	0.5654257288	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.66202492136	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.

0.0	0.433844207899	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.431740914959	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.390373915748	It never happens.
0.0	0.544838434835	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.451918708943	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.424470961598	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.487377329214	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.41162607828	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.425778746927	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.434210475542	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.409389178098	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.442575728255	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.42766406673	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.559958479879	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.473861849253	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.474198319727	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.

0.0	0.38039470558	Absolutely.
0.0	0.686145034875	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.6044609201	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.562032556488	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.426051519633	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.542884731239	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.49051148386	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.451007751153	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
1.0	0.477066766729	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.395449153996	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.543616316041	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.38684930475	It feels different.
0.0	0.491917609312	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.450402221609	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.388392745271	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.516210811746	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.529167847866	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.536105207811	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.490329329126	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.386238469051	You're welcome.
0.0	0.451890891733	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.626212330654	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.684832793985	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.547994608679	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.403945362843	I was the architect.
0.0	0.431227757666	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.546366318097	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.510505990657	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.406868825597	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.480771267907	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.638776473955	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.539755425005	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.41710923571	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.651364768745	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.46995532609	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.527950641494	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.434352326817	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.67676641122	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
1.0	0.392359787517	They were wrong.
0.0	0.4755099395	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.383376567291	I win.
0.0	0.606333132478	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.392023742046	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.5	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.53309904033	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.387198498912	You did.
0.0	0.415756912246	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.458165926505	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.652200108728	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
1.0	0.511884689588	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.466168061288	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.567281219739	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.526847929286	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.533720300742	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.38009155525	Why?
0.0	0.409116129224	Just for the record.
0.0	0.403156578469	The answer is no.
0.0	0.474021069321	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.517756155118	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.389222319236	He's wrong.
0.0	0.416156016585	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.491157848572	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.590426828724	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.428839721748	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.524545278172	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.472479459514	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.447975541565	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.404312552974	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.457224558623	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.404252756459	And, we said no.
0.0	0.510011550693	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.435345244894	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.491106007283	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.472668219003	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.394498729234	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.457379442961	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.440233171938	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.425110839511	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.469027516535	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.399174208948	I would just say that...
0.0	0.750115842292	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.450117916418	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.441703109076	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.485906630538	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.468578894482	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.410117387979	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.505574631304	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.403910256755	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.470569379569	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.41795041017	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.453384095215	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
1.0	0.560740408938	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.485216275995	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.415952050768	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.403419401435	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.537893000456	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
1.0	0.63700137619	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.47951464496	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.450899923957	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.570094990577	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.548441654182	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.592088581188	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.449919260394	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.719040862884	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.544121495478	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.401166800674	My point is this.
0.0	0.406992611661	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.411738063808	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.422935958452	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.416328852484	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.594058069434	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.419930714228	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.391501452534	And you know what?
1.0	0.5	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.545199700779	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.436516565033	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.453881416947	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.431048162718	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.676423296586	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.439939504277	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.419868789063	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.427844392557	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.38714695013	He does great.
0.0	0.427750448122	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.51296218983	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
