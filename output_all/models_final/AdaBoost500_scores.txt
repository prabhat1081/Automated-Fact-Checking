0.0	0.499221091266	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.49995575459	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.485141949535	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.496906933587	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.499086018999	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.479363931854	But...
0.0	0.498015401652	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.50231726274	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.483960106582	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.493718497043	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.498721186826	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.501058420497	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.49922426186	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.497699491451	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.499739439161	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.480142847203	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.481098150131	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.497906884132	I have...
0.0	0.49565240971	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.499091544631	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.498592027779	I promise.
0.0	0.499513369908	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.497589786981	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.501630006579	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.499683976857	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.517547581699	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.502097559755	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
1.0	0.500510963432	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.49988932912	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.486145827213	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.498654362405	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.497926509795	I understand.
0.0	0.498221819294	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.497795010448	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.4979965686	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.498417255205	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.498959101672	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.500489934094	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.501878273579	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.496811983604	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.498753976824	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.481352982629	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.49785014218	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.480310823042	So...
0.0	0.499410871729	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
1.0	0.505796911242	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.497692588142	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.503536870813	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.499266120057	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.497860779718	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.498479403087	I'll say this.
0.0	0.485285819381	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.498553904475	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.497304257987	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.504467316075	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.482663625255	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.498833362609	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.500617356325	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.50003350234	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.485116129966	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.498006095973	It is.
0.0	0.500975395037	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.49670925948	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.500362874604	He hit oil.
0.0	0.501681484452	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.501026811246	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.511415278971	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.50557737864	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.500483423971	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.500301499872	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.495685587156	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.498803550196	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.499073153496	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.500276463335	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.499553630942	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.459835044105	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.502319729394	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.497296327755	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.496138710998	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.479789977912	OK?
0.0	0.481622238126	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.496442999273	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.497867551851	No -- no...
0.0	0.500938882609	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.501182476838	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.501123310922	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.499738494196	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.515164448585	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.483314653944	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.499439397415	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.499444527623	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.499308803695	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.499200257211	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.49670152985	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.49912474172	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.497272062779	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.50216132482	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.498683098111	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.503395426156	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.50059664416	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.479414885169	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.499440415358	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.499462520653	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.498560953694	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.499829697703	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.502273018664	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.50031750321	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.499544542775	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.517798144984	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.498587917388	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.498884737438	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.50012350596	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.501941853633	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.502756652074	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.499653061472	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.498946363315	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.480126287068	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.503946606204	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.508777585609	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.480636160977	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.52037222655	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.500618330095	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.499223386297	Think about it.
0.0	0.480668207087	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.503650133111	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.507256586738	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.500099441613	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.500843187826	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.501707460513	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
1.0	0.487860063124	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.479789977912	Yeah.
0.0	0.499015803654	But I would add this.
1.0	0.503354477613	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
1.0	0.520576373352	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.497613039666	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.495772278565	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.501954526536	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.52497817922	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.498822508866	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.499160811018	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
1.0	0.500627051749	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.498358659109	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.501838869256	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.480492476248	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
1.0	0.528543715736	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.506703433488	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.499363784848	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.499228685435	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.483250720573	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.49864547966	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.502262274679	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.477418473261	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.498075782101	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.497308566139	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.501268754437	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.496932565504	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.500569876328	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.511002494563	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.500469376893	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.488768339345	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.481897853453	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.498489295291	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.501476398164	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.470497424214	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.492282536209	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.499725334343	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.501715568147	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.500051484786	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.52367981847	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.500152728575	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.488126423706	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.499307206484	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.497919664368	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.503748944568	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.499982155635	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.502082320392	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.497915078653	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.498098848061	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.479894155894	...
0.0	0.498842171424	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.498595735183	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.498152140676	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.499196363288	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.502866523117	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.49950706138	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.498322856877	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.499226969898	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.496410936524	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.496674188454	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.500644207705	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.499632937343	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.497762477402	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.499069523896	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.497090098971	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.501261966572	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.4962908046	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.496020010167	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.499019763306	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.49930748614	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.499969725668	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.50027835026	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.49959243793	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.505123010735	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.481007410668	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.49933836977	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.500474042995	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.500470283984	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.506065034619	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.50464757705	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.498511894642	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.498480993323	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.491986338906	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.504671535123	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.497542849574	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.481386245891	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.499211056068	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.49556970059	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.49960219177	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.499673171995	Maria, let me clear something up here.
1.0	0.518650341828	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.49920369398	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.499683512531	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.479363931854	And...
0.0	0.500064294817	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.499178760161	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.50138525956	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.484938839	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
1.0	0.503511656113	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.500228180675	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.503122435284	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.500586878522	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.499947284179	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.482636665511	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.497072494766	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.501801500372	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.499677353206	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.504482086804	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.498814429892	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.493794313075	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.482688341136	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.498749449365	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.517591303974	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.499977424226	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.499607311602	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.486448201314	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.519678600618	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.497125988166	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.506709412184	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.498396587539	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.499838730334	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.49990755837	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.500688937469	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.509572406339	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.496713155361	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.499887789396	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.499827224086	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.480688046224	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
1.0	0.49992002663	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.498801063508	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.50004410369	Both served.
0.0	0.501355721332	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.500324365485	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.495417489599	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.499684120402	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.479553905538	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.483252474775	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.49818165451	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.504498286451	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.501626109506	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.486713638895	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.499230888102	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.498946240933	He does great.
0.0	0.498973844283	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.500704711873	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.506186335447	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.500065066008	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.507562897287	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.500982555089	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.498397037777	I love China.
0.0	0.497802833585	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.499652617327	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.501962757188	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.496905680429	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.499519290247	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.498076668604	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.491115024336	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.499033760411	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.499827204964	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.499660296714	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.498244842531	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.498242908436	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.499226525101	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.498124472735	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.480458056886	Illegal.
0.0	0.500200441528	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.502684794364	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.505406788294	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.498010713649	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.475278478148	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.498025367348	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.499223725963	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.503374242542	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.503441583505	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.500335377586	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.498569517459	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.499485024896	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.500031957061	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.502582943261	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.491792261587	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.49992483439	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.498740790747	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.484129842592	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.498244899338	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.501046377278	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
1.0	0.502458369604	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.498500279912	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.495815455612	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.481301144823	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.499386499474	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.499485930398	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.495030244995	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.507356393359	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.477569820884	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.500326026315	They cause dishonesty.
1.0	0.50500637805	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.508599232507	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.500239179192	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.499475763055	Here's a fact.
1.0	0.496158806492	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.498620570122	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.499072944272	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.499210229686	How about this?
0.0	0.478913037596	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.499540747546	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.498874159126	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.492298899207	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.499067771162	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.498918413825	So you know what?
0.0	0.499007042228	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.489964672205	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.499165735726	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.49817623703	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.499612639025	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.500634951404	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.504755586945	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.499641384024	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.498732415593	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.499247730869	That's the difference.
0.0	0.499341042836	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.499271821859	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.500873153216	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.496765655613	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.499055346199	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.473857725415	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.49954863009	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.51007402399	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.500213253426	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.498772141789	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.498566285557	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.498229467385	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.521313335797	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.497611819819	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.499893673864	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.500587623078	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.497590966466	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.501642531876	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.499493660472	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.496016918421	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.496838904279	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.497656558807	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.500967827182	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.498047526974	I would just say that...
0.0	0.499253010215	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.500658562047	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.49957562999	That's not true.
0.0	0.482556827194	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.498973522898	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.494914870531	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.500932030331	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.499294272858	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.498955888239	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.49719813405	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.498950059055	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.502069135857	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.500577024952	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.503780521506	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.501591928656	We put in place child care support.

0.0	0.480874760964	Ever.
0.0	0.497161979275	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.502376780467	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.498387312056	And you know what?
0.0	0.49815709205	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.508559941494	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.503492551879	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
1.0	0.499018767441	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.486385532415	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.500046335416	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.500323904979	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.494463230473	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.501002903857	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.498899933692	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.500552146031	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.498345097328	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.495848344424	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.497732289132	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.49876013085	I will not do that.
0.0	0.498929190758	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
1.0	0.501599681296	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.498043239001	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.499911020393	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.492639373271	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.477795863018	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.495947920585	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.498217594443	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.486543756379	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.499402467035	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.500648940174	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1.0	0.499909688972	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.499054344575	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.499720470607	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.497588007892	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.480331002063	John.
0.0	0.496484986987	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.501847177792	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.497751115864	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.499419001343	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.499377327169	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.499230083498	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.500326072586	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
1.0	0.50072326701	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.499391361894	His family certainly believes that.
1.0	0.498721354026	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.499598922076	She was right.
0.0	0.497726430805	And why?
0.0	0.500181248387	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.496769321157	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.497545974778	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.498866234398	That's not right.
0.0	0.500486578566	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.520774823752	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.500594830482	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.500847266872	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.511060362147	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.498964423193	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.495671456304	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.503802666949	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.500542843269	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.498075934091	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.480458056886	No.
0.0	0.49546552308	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.510033721928	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.482954327063	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.498349043358	That's right.
0.0	0.499132609737	The economy was really booming.
1.0	0.517600559669	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.502637957766	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.499082671768	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.499427698647	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.498162264367	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.486359638062	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.499079276492	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.498740548276	That has not been...
0.0	0.500991799862	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.496863127201	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.500598250669	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.507990030637	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.497406523011	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.482573167958	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.500360870268	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.494416099064	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.498822197639	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.492081406058	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.499469710932	The problem is we never get it done.
1.0	0.501558161913	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.481585261449	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.508097194636	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.499867410706	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.499888021563	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.501527664929	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.481703654061	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.501622355756	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.502423973197	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.500009391466	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.500985669962	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.510812404578	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.496896393344	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.495555501428	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.482125958074	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.500884460904	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.499424369249	You're right.
0.0	0.502958217385	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.517072351733	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.50067514255	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
1.0	0.50107367651	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.504500865997	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.499337146858	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.497731275171	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.500708211984	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.500197414993	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.500177377832	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.483059765591	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.500401524416	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.479466602334	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.498435226803	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.497403885824	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.505226796419	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.502144246098	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.498114333284	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.502399361057	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.500220154964	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.500494269384	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.498755563027	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.500195695719	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.498248475137	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.500012604073	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.499891835747	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.49930906273	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.500785951931	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.499225855543	Our next president...
0.0	0.498895123341	I've laid out...
0.0	0.50031708894	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.498894765468	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.501168083417	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.499346708277	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.501741406863	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.494486357861	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.500892902176	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.501071909356	Just for the record.
0.0	0.498854542423	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.499698948349	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.498302699074	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.508700352507	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.499184136485	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.495247072021	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.499758933473	He's wrong.
0.0	0.497516691541	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.480874760964	Right.
0.0	0.500762455273	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.49961852674	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.499364585341	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.499875347636	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.467672884901	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.499164916416	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.493020229139	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.498700671019	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.50321064255	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.499908946381	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.499465944117	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.501411335856	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.498621608023	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.501256761962	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.499147064404	That's fine.
0.0	0.495875873488	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.494015958389	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.499403501449	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.498738123888	...before I go.
0.0	0.500544249745	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.498578143639	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.500679272521	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.500852735184	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.500150524319	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.499950632086	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.497893551395	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.499174852455	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.49971892055	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.501922483096	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.498965367617	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.495813341471	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.505602146879	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.499444429263	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.499386618028	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.497639468877	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.499240243232	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.500103938225	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.507424438686	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.501801130901	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.500540083862	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.499893075321	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.498404872801	That's what he is.
0.0	0.498304935684	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.497450193717	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.499038052808	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.50713174065	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
1.0	0.50074005927	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.49999550517	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.498711869753	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.4814795426	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.496122681642	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.496639442272	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.521524284162	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.485251480297	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.501034496883	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.498329513859	We need sound money.
0.0	0.500426223094	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.479065304672	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.497748988659	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.500064395214	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.500057196916	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.498049833822	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.516821721668	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.497299562972	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.498125067748	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.500244629325	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.494991231535	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.499664409042	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.485859566331	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.499810296871	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.499993200828	A brief response.
0.0	0.498740248283	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.502565181686	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.498646217078	You did.
0.0	0.49844032321	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.497070344396	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.487901206757	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.499048780026	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.48865130645	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.49886960808	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.504584211657	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
1.0	0.499197939796	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.499522966484	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.4997965567	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.497726169456	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.497488800549	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
1.0	0.496383577863	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.500203855295	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.496571571617	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.48604241882	It feels different.
0.0	0.501178185751	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.487167575018	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.499233762889	I never said that.
0.0	0.498004633143	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.498327331826	Why is that?
0.0	0.499696176303	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.500018795424	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.496177731265	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.50120835852	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.500876908968	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.498895676415	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.487628652595	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.498497401693	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.501275975617	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.479789977912	OK?
0.0	0.498538588392	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.499506497184	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.500042328424	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.500034527392	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.51756845637	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.499718365425	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.499485441046	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.499054344575	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.50105094879	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.499962739611	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.504401579913	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.498089871943	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.498424960528	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.501382317793	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.503574770802	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.4993357406	Well, sure.
0.0	0.499379552988	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.498859673098	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.500834884767	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.50756582596	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.498592249783	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.497843684735	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.498747210374	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.49796369289	You just want to...
0.0	0.499195210359	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.497654550976	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.500200780876	I love this country.
0.0	0.499464787039	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.49863347273	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.500679517753	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.496798155921	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.500137702951	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.499905530364	Two points.
0.0	0.49938860626	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.480914881294	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.498783639716	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.49967499657	I changed that.
0.0	0.498900192475	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.499840192969	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.503936322927	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.513128471155	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.506152984803	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.497432817288	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.499438182588	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.499747888427	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.498321881121	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.503776856672	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.498298106059	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.501915125878	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.498899065595	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.493142472075	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.50230470903	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.51095273237	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
1.0	0.497506521533	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.50018025317	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
1.0	0.498198328626	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.50034791189	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.498962512655	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.480458056886	No.
0.0	0.502076647298	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.499210068356	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.484133646715	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.500400677164	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.500392735944	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.498743697393	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.502511861911	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.500032001665	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.486173855437	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.500259105753	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.500490660022	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.494125479264	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.504658584233	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.499007042228	Check it out.
0.0	0.499872433343	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.499582435454	They were wrong.
0.0	0.500033858428	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.499843987472	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.494229662925	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.510892182265	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
1.0	0.502523084381	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.495865540676	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.497028372641	No vision at all.
0.0	0.496010436411	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.500147232103	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.501116557201	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.500150245545	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.500243747692	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.502615298974	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.4979588229	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.497988311633	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.49970588338	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.498560607018	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.499136163192	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.51365940896	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.50307429071	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.500229311839	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.499955870095	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.497328444234	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.498020427182	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.499940036725	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.488662734713	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.49627302536	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.498939517498	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.500063176097	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.500646475649	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.500974168296	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.501080672466	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.500112850339	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.497335776288	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.499281266333	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
1.0	0.49484027712	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.50156366752	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.504595395265	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.499024583147	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.499594286622	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.502266228656	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.499169114564	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.499805606411	On welfare.
0.0	0.500212502637	I have no idea.
0.0	0.490636253146	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.50095986135	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.498787350766	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.497580042494	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.49818703323	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.502256223893	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.503324724355	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.491855926775	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.503853449988	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.49924281964	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.502175546274	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.523218927458	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.499305860071	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.495937206465	I want security.
0.0	0.498648742014	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.486827590457	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.480807731841	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.499722765152	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.49846580636	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.500569969009	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.500028471677	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.499252534625	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.

0.0	0.503221195528	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.499405137157	This is a bad deal.

0.0	0.49826685055	My point is this.
0.0	0.498425109438	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.494720143586	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.

0.0	0.499332032597	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.479235688421	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.507458412259	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.498360601456	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.

0.0	0.5021992111	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.520005601535	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.496694889329	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.499921862044	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.

0.0	0.499405893192	No, the new planes.

0.0	0.487593649796	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.501135157894	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.503170290557	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.499598922076	I didn't.
0.0	0.499708762601	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.50979319059	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.504525990578	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.498785621982	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.498744866587	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.498442911042	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.501751079556	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.501743217938	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.496388936161	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.49921278982	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
1.0	0.500517763948	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.498556329219	We have to do something.
0.0	0.49969390849	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.492243476661	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.503335290825	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.500390258979	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.499583431965	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.499016550905	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.492521924131	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.499219562534	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.499927143914	Number one, you have people in this country that...

0.0	0.500603145737	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.499753405225	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.507945930786	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.49622060478	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.501883645082	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.499822632157	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.476187747287	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.499246918363	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.499355395496	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.502227117274	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.499270047171	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.500440735756	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.501189282756	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.481016478043	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.500088796062	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.504586619234	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.497688163195	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.500090873888	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.

0.0	0.505357846263	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.499077369058	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.500439074237	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.495013825101	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.502854135242	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.499698731517	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.503027785127	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.

0.0	0.500255339324	They're absolutely false.

0.0	0.500867837166	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.

0.0	0.499840550011	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.493052517141	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.493179527641	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.516082099655	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.482692409009	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.498107228779	...income tax...
0.0	0.499694211758	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.517709569186	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.499368377911	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.482702663083	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.474407815616	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.499753125833	You bet they do.
0.0	0.499262790187	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
1.0	0.499018592556	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.503249110879	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.500001155868	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.497908576651	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.499558642275	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.51059323336	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.

0.0	0.499369192229	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.499747545891	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.498613006936	She said the truth.
0.0	0.496747659351	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.501020643663	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.524682628565	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.498685942879	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.499644347034	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.

0.0	0.505813850995	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.48204950017	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.498280780556	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.500296961384	We're running.
0.0	0.495232482652	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
1.0	0.50283428794	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.5311892748	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.496304155533	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.501710238644	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.497453951594	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.500312331632	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.493656714786	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.

0.0	0.501248549329	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.498316244969	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.499489869288	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.499567869293	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.497479053634	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.497745435417	And here's why.
0.0	0.497673561674	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.500028683221	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.487506753776	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.495573439558	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.504855946346	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
1.0	0.501564813317	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.497544965739	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.500802319533	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.498273471167	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.481760864719	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.499597867094	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.500500876357	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.487187607582	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.496686413005	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.480331002063	Alright.
0.0	0.499462737095	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.497681387263	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.481843667776	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.502188921198	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.502927279663	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.498875265911	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.500054976197	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.499829957842	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.502170557182	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
1.0	0.499084309685	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.501256801304	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.483391301924	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.500667998024	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.498879792326	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.500269689458	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.499752763112	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.498806768165	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.499298991764	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.499776280222	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.499690409211	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.50109980114	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.501065131175	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.498680985788	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.502301101334	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.499780119596	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.504631966637	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.49795841024	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.503952431395	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.489536450572	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.50064106861	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.498232489135	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.496219839839	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.509218712191	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.499775209482	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.499495290636	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.499880174926	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.497634097076	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.499857642293	We can't do it.
0.0	0.500841190126	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.499240364055	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.500117368854	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.49819541458	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.505575383819	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.497955078783	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.499126194139	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.512813501545	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.500923403293	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.499444769152	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.498937127978	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.487298924436	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.50331584195	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.491330344414	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.499654279907	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.511405148068	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.507263464488	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.498683222442	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.493032589854	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.498817101201	I would change them.
0.0	0.501468443079	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.500024306153	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.498472724418	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.500360874436	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.498865225824	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.500109952212	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.49940762834	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.500945538312	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.501047257915	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
1.0	0.499704296091	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.500975882984	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.497666886749	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.501049342663	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.498484112639	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
1.0	0.49884036569	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.495366389367	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.507774699412	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.479789977912	Yeah.
0.0	0.497351516233	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.49871103491	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.501327054743	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.499828893948	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.500503074902	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.514253480274	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.496103497122	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.499529401256	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.499529993225	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.499073100455	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.507138319245	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.500176132019	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.499678668621	I was not at all.
1.0	0.498280281213	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.48307885153	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.494709047262	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.49924606844	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.499619944879	I'm ready.
0.0	0.504723711264	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.498738123888	...Thank you.
0.0	0.501472307873	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.49970232196	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.482603930853	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.497937358307	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.500242146616	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.491803861008	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.497801276422	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.499233762889	I never said that.
0.0	0.506206000943	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.489935094624	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.503672684159	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.497911818065	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.499562000002	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.499512600367	He is a good man.
0.0	0.517786721101	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.506311251658	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.506481630679	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.495160746065	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.494757113916	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.49883933868	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
1.0	0.501620189379	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.500296930821	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.479894155894	...
0.0	0.500508823865	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.50186091886	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.499040930704	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.505805727797	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.

0.0	0.501916487761	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.500816944853	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.498619864682	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.498276512084	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.

0.0	0.499884531172	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.49680468692	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.

0.0	0.500301023346	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.500265603213	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.499508942153	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.496321834351	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.501591991246	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.506439191316	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.49823441151	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.50357968271	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.500993980903	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.498129871317	Well, yes, indeed.

0.0	0.500099747513	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.497362680146	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.494726972259	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.50036864837	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
1.0	0.498887531676	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.503003620299	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.499307711861	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.49824881113	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.50128423718	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.480982215109	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.496590434099	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.498895126821	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.504569112258	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.

0.0	0.501046687819	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.494116096026	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.499973661508	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.498037845156	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.500314887516	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.499754178349	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
1.0	0.504147010155	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.478067472411	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.498870472671	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.501328978752	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
1.0	0.509896795623	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.51723079833	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.498972562532	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.511639856998	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.499151041624	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.516845207912	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.499223839026	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.497860387211	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.

0.0	0.501567955579	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.497773049859	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.501287565802	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.518447154556	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.499264438889	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.516898589197	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.506143962471	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.498428125394	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.499187673064	We cannot be the world's policeman.
1.0	0.510368397187	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.50114800419	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.499688507027	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.517829614665	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.500885000559	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.497839059382	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.496720285176	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.497972240761	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.498763673398	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.494223401034	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...

0.0	0.50203392381	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.496736321326	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.500135027297	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.498881104431	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.499146338652	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.497121520288	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.499603902615	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.496901187695	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.495099110646	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.494556716913	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.498950809889	OK, good.
0.0	0.499237122814	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.498186507928	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.496907432838	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.500488186362	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.493651216421	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.506603950091	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.489191887698	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.495594135343	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.505467196119	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.497943538653	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.501541219602	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.500431171198	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.495211999783	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.50032385463	You have to lead.
0.0	0.480874760964	Right.
0.0	0.49919373259	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.498347580166	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.499564251853	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.499889546801	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.49993534639	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.501860592678	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.50168894707	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.500621895034	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.493053678118	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.481718283036	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.499928323668	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.493382540602	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.499342631418	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.499982834406	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.500304684937	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.510947697911	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.49915437024	That is important.
0.0	0.485007573438	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.500105433385	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.500812795447	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.500458699704	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.501062983102	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
1.0	0.503632239723	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.497359321524	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.4988694394	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.50224119101	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.497841443525	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.501757854482	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.518219138789	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.497079833469	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.498546624382	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.498664329307	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.498910665893	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.498036578428	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.498813210771	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.504923381449	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.501433651585	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.499130908526	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.498803066628	I would change them.
0.0	0.501524465707	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.498007288071	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.500201810006	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.502055432151	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.497411779768	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.498971468995	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.499977650541	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.497760565091	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.497773909398	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.498466484385	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.499609952353	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.500424482739	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.494370918624	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.50115481123	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.50381377875	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.499765055357	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.497722318889	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.501178647529	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.500059616798	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.500595386453	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.501084196627	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.498489859674	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.499755956315	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.499595146878	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.49922181259	No their not.
0.0	0.487019443981	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.498951099368	They're a scam.
0.0	0.477014874053	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.499434881357	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.499177505174	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.479789977912	Okay.
0.0	0.500855367277	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.499466563564	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.500780500194	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.496118992971	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.500249231244	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.497537516007	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.499808685252	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.498275999106	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.498606571701	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.499388479189	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.499353582143	I've done it.
0.0	0.498371829238	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.496415031839	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.479887118979	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.481511727858	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.498789299245	I can do that.
1.0	0.495594510497	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.498060416202	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.499195362075	We were wrong.
0.0	0.499424369249	You're right.
1.0	0.504151289411	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.483398973272	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.510397251655	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.496042065877	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.502208747386	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.50095775077	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.499805022172	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.499514430007	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.499154970671	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.500082303451	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.500435016037	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.497505146271	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.514733757071	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.494458603727	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.500107801371	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.499099424966	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.500892874099	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.498851357573	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.499561683969	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.497679007653	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.498319534452	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.501143089636	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
1.0	0.495505102967	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.493665480008	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.500799622005	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.501454073538	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.499598922076	Well, I did.
0.0	0.480766495246	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.499981580018	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.499681870074	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.501010065445	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.498326292345	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.496726259499	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.500732276411	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.500479151209	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.499267862502	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.495287084602	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.498092048196	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.51829657595	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.497617731381	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.497650400559	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.486587332207	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.502857501013	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.486932404323	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.499181594649	No, you did.
0.0	0.501265590596	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.499857876238	Yeah, they are unhinged.
1.0	0.501021462947	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.50298372404	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.491210609266	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.4993988229	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.49862941812	And we are not England.
0.0	0.501912791868	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.499433326927	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.503799538286	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.493300698805	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.500679619313	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.506367995532	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.483955673069	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.502176436672	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.499649214271	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.50063070668	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.499327333778	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.499612782013	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.506845155378	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.500206721952	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.500730082363	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.499490706183	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.500565488653	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.499529798602	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.498567677928	How do I know this?
0.0	0.51190962262	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.500693836316	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.483232116735	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.498732168015	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.497253720724	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.498605192022	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.517917594604	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.502438929585	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.504446573955	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.502918853696	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.499695891534	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.5007308664	You count on it.
0.0	0.501618819963	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.501330148834	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.503196202344	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.499184710628	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.502760559589	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.498387312056	And you know what?
0.0	0.499354402841	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.500050654093	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.500021211276	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.483377536524	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.494245018915	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.501259545072	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.498045134796	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.50441748447	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.498515484804	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.491741975089	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.47911848542	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.498100409409	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.497669266837	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.499728447089	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.497794709272	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.496784110805	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.499562332778	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.483993100916	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.499173186126	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.480458056886	See?
0.0	0.502766907743	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.499064308059	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.50083677845	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.499862860765	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.509981635699	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.499403501362	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.488835782754	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.499019866748	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.500422200172	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.505180127232	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.499173779973	But we stuck to our message.
1.0	0.509659422034	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.503424056999	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.496593678994	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.4977929853	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.499445497593	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.498238760598	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.502460268806	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.49906120538	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.497363245034	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.499348407228	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.500238648781	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.498658811005	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.5025046183	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.499083108369	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.497083059947	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.501082500519	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.499528468294	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.503480094213	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.502180384898	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.499518702666	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.499759939812	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.50072575908	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.499338757205	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.49926492154	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.499516532746	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.480513624797	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.477866513583	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.500518786294	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.498471665535	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.503165659269	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.497251613433	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.500700445997	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.501642899966	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.479691905611	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.499144259635	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.501524911224	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.500790536768	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.485582305581	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.498926322124	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.498226752522	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.498380724735	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.496363527931	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.501764966675	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.499664859334	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
1.0	0.50141744933	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.500651599426	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.517322215066	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.486830024571	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.497764650428	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.498983565344	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.498939556985	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.500494180803	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.500690409382	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.493386176778	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.500232343605	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.500063281746	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.500713550829	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.480874760964	Dynamically.
0.0	0.499544726011	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.482241053272	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.501878056167	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.499050965994	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.501217475851	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.50013233458	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
1.0	0.49991971163	That's wrong.
0.0	0.517553319701	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.498858112117	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.502146711744	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.501019641174	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.49906120538	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.479789977912	Yes.
0.0	0.499054662866	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.506012155548	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.500545893018	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.499276145165	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.516900660781	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.499997954189	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.502737670289	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.498182562586	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.499594876366	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.501907082388	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.504180584063	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.493137507075	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.508917224559	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.482738447913	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.481848822293	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.50077909211	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.496703967999	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.500622145699	Well, let us level with the American people.
1.0	0.501970509891	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.49860074668	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.498908360022	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.480458056886	No.
1.0	0.492925189032	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.498986478218	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.501005065216	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.501192871806	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.499569375149	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.498908456001	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.500108549521	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.500621895034	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.496698559578	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.496849907388	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.507316715871	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.500761146138	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.501710561922	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.498353429435	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.499737524766	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.499642558325	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.47686439911	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.497615368748	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.498931219781	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.498732332369	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.495178462666	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.498936891124	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.502452208213	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.498546287018	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.488063294053	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.498170726876	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.499913401988	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.500912034858	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.493753209508	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.501165459379	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.498372780084	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.504806964992	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.49336031243	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.50045249528	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.499135112395	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.501239452203	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.498979446659	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.49813427466	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.499522929457	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.497979311135	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.498411899712	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.499491383953	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.499570282835	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.502197309344	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.479523260651	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
1.0	0.501023924975	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.499007374555	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.497134874833	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.498902245376	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.496612250666	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.5073951016	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.499253045715	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.4979588229	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.49834254526	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.501021718878	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.482025972008	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.501066406842	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.504241836469	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.496742887896	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.498772348767	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.500592371996	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.501494591022	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.499533298452	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.49990943733	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.499946387656	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.497211044583	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.498789299245	You can have him.
0.0	0.50064409397	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.499964005399	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.499448717445	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.498317281792	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.498373414211	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.494396315	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.500049446762	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.499179802144	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.499707738556	The world has changed.
0.0	0.499418784488	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.498448661545	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.498893812157	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.49787790064	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.501227889687	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.501071199018	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.501837525435	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.499940231114	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.497857495563	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.499007566428	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.500305848716	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.500247289382	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.501390565283	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.500630145301	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.493114581889	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.501853271804	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.498246723485	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.501077946687	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.501632738839	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.497618731448	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.498452489935	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.528047035563	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.501247504761	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.49907155948	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.499527197318	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.498469977553	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.4973769787	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.482341968675	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.499936003632	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.499552907828	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.501829789173	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.496207464669	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.499311590603	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.479789977912	Yes.
0.0	0.499107960118	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.493502636194	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.496371449276	Big difference.
0.0	0.498749855284	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.499953822146	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.500416954713	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.500486209343	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.498669338817	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.49964982179	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.500411846964	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.499418930515	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.499923817763	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.503894795804	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.498387312056	And you know what?
0.0	0.499829565241	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.501819709662	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.498420218469	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.479789977912	OK.
0.0	0.49752619411	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.49963765699	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.499444429263	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.517996709491	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.496652132299	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.4982358068	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.500035538892	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.502379529409	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.518294606771	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.49961249286	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.498358018186	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.484024529467	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.498868030526	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.498698686973	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.498698686973	We don't need that.
0.0	0.495703536453	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.499861518336	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.501380492498	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.498681263833	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.499601773299	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.502619751353	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.498329513859	We need sound money.
0.0	0.500662788351	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.499223043966	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.479898967099	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.500279085583	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.497154690727	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.483790327687	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.500728620003	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
1.0	0.501186991557	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.498870475892	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.497119687083	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.497653330956	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.498387312056	And you know what?
0.0	0.499485737097	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.499906135465	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.503221199523	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.507834590912	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.502652517513	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.503619801192	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.499043208586	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.49701171599	...John...
0.0	0.496003102425	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.500078310718	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.501016839221	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.49891774392	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.488110313445	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.519472372195	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.500543728534	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.499061391645	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.499054344575	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.485282409003	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.481329315744	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.507071325924	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.499021400185	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.498314679816	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.500120218353	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.505959669371	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.500459133919	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.497144406682	Maria, I'd just like to say...
1.0	0.498132822094	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.497462863862	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.482780566552	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.499510293361	We actually did it.
0.0	0.496864222203	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.500815876024	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.495960336801	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.484194100192	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.496534542508	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.499838128321	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.518744313961	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.477068002477	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.503228048487	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.499147064404	That's fine.
0.0	0.486029987186	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.499533309965	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.499134408979	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.482772570746	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.500990317893	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.499574600294	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.499719285302	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.500396017949	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.498769177988	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.520676941891	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.502624247051	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.497937468836	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.496839610609	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.500132098819	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.524807075635	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.498404971382	And so do I.
0.0	0.497550335182	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.478494274539	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.497517897122	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.503886902884	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.498032776719	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.475268931024	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.475574166287	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.498139794147	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.516692137199	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.482770953548	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.497317882493	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
1.0	0.502072219359	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.487614553423	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.497514723681	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.498580980387	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.49976597994	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.515987680245	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.50125821342	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.500407932532	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.507827490851	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.498420080079	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.500092992532	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
1.0	0.501188287022	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.50152899276	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.506473666892	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.497270785882	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.482517801479	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.499101331437	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.499499008284	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.499600512064	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.511489969201	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.501496936948	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.499647435976	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.484075189668	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.497325972705	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.497941745907	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.482901356077	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
1.0	0.500468752074	Very few children.
0.0	0.503813060282	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.498053088479	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.487672458565	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.499897065638	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.497674457279	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
1.0	0.501314583177	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.499442356228	I agree with them.
0.0	0.50140406962	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.496457066084	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.497592310222	You looking at me?
0.0	0.499541963687	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.496663201501	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.

0.0	0.498221896577	I think the times are much more serious.
1.0	0.500466889486	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.499855117342	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.

0.0	0.510248982971	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.498564448994	In addition to that...

1.0	0.500565571818	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.498253923829	I can.
0.0	0.481603433725	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.50318476571	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.

0.0	0.500918538211	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.497529562228	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.501278402466	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.499233762889	I never said that.
0.0	0.500906244965	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.500186001868	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.500763333468	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.496803154268	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.484404931794	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.499334477035	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.500838415375	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.499273003834	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.498376310999	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.497231226208	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.50040595061	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.47664658334	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.498167739707	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.501304636529	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.49729425556	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.482246293178	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.497361171277	I think you're --
0.0	0.498706118306	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
1.0	0.520045368615	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.505308050383	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.499864981877	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.498174530867	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.500632280388	He was on the board.

0.0	0.498542464411	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.

0.0	0.498611026751	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.499264584962	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.

0.0	0.485974809038	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.498662294418	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.499188916311	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.500148069375	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.529368695183	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.499285228919	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.499904631975	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.497087148827	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.498320891158	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.499994775385	I know every one.
0.0	0.498800330118	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.498601087887	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.499845734173	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.500023209469	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.482396641923	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.499947426137	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.500205220799	You find me...
0.0	0.498710060784	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.494533809207	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.501041825643	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.49989002031	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.496215332997	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.493492160988	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.499697202844	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.495919201746	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.49817803756	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.501482718249	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.480458056886	No.
0.0	0.488204847091	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.497176331332	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.500397202501	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.505159486123	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.475947972958	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.501123857239	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
1.0	0.49596097572	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.500785893326	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.498904749652	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.498278597936	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.494821509547	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.499462324034	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.498440096816	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.496360710508	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.500652674325	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.499843961527	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.499439942227	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.49932168336	But I was born here.
0.0	0.500050707656	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.499113337975	In all due respect...
0.0	0.498703681914	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.486048779095	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.490310044168	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.478382087103	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.503577455924	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.499232377084	We have no borders.
0.0	0.498919794493	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.499869550698	I win.
0.0	0.499119515714	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.499841923766	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.498404777532	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.497977818261	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.500852647838	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.499411566141	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.500916275918	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.502256476385	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.49920212595	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.499626757601	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.50149434207	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.499811550963	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.501719813254	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
1.0	0.501956558956	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.499059734561	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.497928622461	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.501293215264	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.500987695718	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.500821781528	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.500070264322	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.500226012488	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.500516746283	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.498866234398	That's not right.
1.0	0.507827621405	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.498564027403	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.498942427105	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.507659588517	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.500722889804	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.499371395556	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.50119054427	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.516818466621	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.499609774568	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.500661893664	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.50099044846	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.499223386297	Think about that.
0.0	0.508418833507	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.481853568336	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.499381952059	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.497114609249	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.48657610206	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.498693416329	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.496432069643	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.499653258843	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.498117629111	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.501739785015	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.503057726009	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.503003322723	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.481701370417	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.500977714301	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.499555783088	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.496124835474	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.499139649386	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.498225076234	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.499223386297	Think about it.
0.0	0.499515384681	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.498727669519	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.498964394952	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.499616281499	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.486718596392	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.49680115884	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.499184469279	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.499624534734	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.498596384718	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.499239563713	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.499580738376	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.499600126552	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.499438503657	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.499148232263	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.501033537577	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.499176673415	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.513573221898	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.496727817739	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.508880458103	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.512789432498	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.505805750923	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.503164406561	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
1.0	0.500286338213	I never filed for bankruptcy.

0.0	0.498785798555	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.496846699664	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.501556695701	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
1.0	0.50035223098	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.500523562316	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.498958795128	It goes away.
0.0	0.504741219919	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.505673961862	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.498653224557	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.498351199358	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.504576644906	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.499615695676	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.50045145307	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.498292672215	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.496942239834	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.500329055068	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.501938270758	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.499049554036	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.499309744397	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.499196410345	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.491808468138	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.500274757186	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.498392877658	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.498372023277	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.498669184658	That's for sure.
0.0	0.50020537933	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.514999239233	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.500180595859	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.498901928638	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.496942898998	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.498810291606	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.500829709254	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.500046656486	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.498432541982	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.497862157386	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.499385922081	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.499722276604	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.50133633032	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.498378582251	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.498350167692	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.499173158965	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.4990352014	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.502167825093	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.481864784874	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.479894155894	...
0.0	0.500217202954	They're a scam.
0.0	0.497215057269	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.50048038868	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
1.0	0.500723403772	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.498972531751	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.482931559453	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.498075934091	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.496850993159	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.501533743729	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.501425520025	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.505409313904	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.494394495601	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.482285579787	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.499199399391	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
1.0	0.524604754274	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.

0.0	0.499853744116	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.500768039131	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.494265783471	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.499940195482	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.497364252565	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.501438356001	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.481773422301	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.499497778716	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.501185682553	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.480357366561	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.498282353538	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.500032879477	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.481683138678	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.496974933197	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.495129182577	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.498918413825	You're welcome.
0.0	0.498383037627	They know.
0.0	0.497251332164	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.50168757529	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.49619198434	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.50062108188	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.499610908042	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.501090558814	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.506605924367	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.486115115439	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.501566854327	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.480486066581	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.498318597052	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.496586229557	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.500253143854	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.500777041388	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.500668100069	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.47802170127	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.500845812623	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.499262579582	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.500015804317	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.499625247083	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.499404732647	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.497900369788	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.500405073227	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.501925650677	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.511360613736	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.504051986624	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.494984773737	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.498704275073	You know why?
0.0	0.499512600367	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.498681392382	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.497715939348	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
1.0	0.500526820668	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.498841428766	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.504829783935	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.498479403087	I will do that.
0.0	0.498811043404	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.500306256034	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.498844207618	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.500470891703	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
1.0	0.499095788507	In the past he has called him weak.
1.0	0.502737649829	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.500000420279	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.500843414306	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.498142897295	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.49972935222	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.499893465257	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.485804727925	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.498513894458	And, we said no.
0.0	0.498359404518	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.481554148477	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.498650809812	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.506906124132	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.500134940445	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.485670484317	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.500617895318	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.502834708138	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.498319295877	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.502427180869	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.499788474712	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.499468293126	We don't win.
0.0	0.498701974306	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.486593464506	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.497575946016	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.497385075402	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.495161066722	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
1.0	0.496213429412	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.500578427455	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.499505825272	Not bad.
1.0	0.500079202414	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.497091681378	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.509506176165	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.501659512278	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.498988909142	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.481792318034	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.49885254448	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.501835084274	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.511478706516	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.497899219064	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.499568973704	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.497956916189	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.499424369249	We haven't.
0.0	0.502941143287	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.498797146321	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.499872416825	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.500011117681	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.499562264598	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.499966486201	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.479894155894	...
0.0	0.479801593239	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.499493726343	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.502252786295	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.476908447195	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.502067111163	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.502692877529	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.499506846744	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.505769488564	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.495874763365	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.49699558863	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.500207235733	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.498024662488	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.499842053716	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
1.0	0.501315441343	It looked like very few women.
1.0	0.504183012063	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.498627088965	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.516819260916	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.499217963181	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.485362268369	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.504663437505	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.477835497025	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.498367321682	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.497704747215	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.501049794201	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.500590374333	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.498809795385	That will change everything.
0.0	0.498900832672	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.484696257627	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.498370653052	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.483064940502	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.498201837362	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.484489112195	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.503378291604	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.498760066733	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.501016285358	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.501478358017	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.499787330305	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.500472508285	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.499250047951	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.503030153532	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.4986117151	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.49817967167	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.498707132581	Nobody can deny them.
1.0	0.500956196817	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.496993739038	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.499971460722	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.50344344524	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.499560436201	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.500451130232	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.499602653649	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.499338430195	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.499874268575	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.493269206384	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.512227965759	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.497739403817	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.498760717	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.499010280013	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.49500824161	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.499409684515	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.498743987407	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.499467229194	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.499887207011	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.499592679031	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.482772042252	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.500396836037	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.50028705656	(inaudible).
0.0	0.498891768945	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.500830514572	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.48685885198	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.49627080525	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.505213798436	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.499708568423	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.498672948465	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.501190222156	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.479789977912	OK?
0.0	0.498502687579	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.479621945653	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.51467219974	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.499065194143	Well, thank you very much.
1.0	0.502216471368	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.50143919137	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.499114134063	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.497722552515	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.507448919061	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.496210940559	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.498958428807	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.498920923015	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.499297401051	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.500021431226	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.498811116246	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.500161981131	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.498958795128	It never happens.
0.0	0.499874873258	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.500489857746	That never works.
0.0	0.501479640382	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.502904433819	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.49855717065	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.49948494967	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.499999843235	My name was mentioned here.
1.0	0.50592473266	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.506688956095	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.500663610463	I'm tested.
0.0	0.500329566964	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.499983181209	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.493808248613	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.502349245338	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.497333848307	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.498467947496	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.500712560363	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.500446744286	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.500819880888	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.50050672861	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.498745289145	They're off to China.
0.0	0.497626711231	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.499804424708	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.48196467585	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.484610637436	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.504233395961	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.498025342961	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.49615864851	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.497704284506	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.490681961567	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.482490644651	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.501095568658	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.476383562542	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.498692671789	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.50170004744	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.50928893729	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.498277665721	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.498958795128	It never happens.
0.0	0.49918568018	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.50068907473	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.497424305672	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.486670840613	I was the architect.
0.0	0.496290845475	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.515709729304	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.49836844839	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.500255255693	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.500104080291	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.499383853054	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.497589105104	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.501612913917	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.498199138622	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.499674109431	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.498635222454	That is our government today.
0.0	0.498987166198	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.493885143054	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.501019701523	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.479789977912	OK?
0.0	0.501489075263	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.49917984967	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.49968932128	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.497441318869	That is...
0.0	0.500934007924	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.498121154699	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.499763517453	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.508380437559	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
1.0	0.486678382835	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.507317836826	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.499539711923	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.499538712958	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.498792956402	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.498704275073	You know why?
0.0	0.500060464234	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.499199142732	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.49695317374	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.502992817716	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.499451070741	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.498229947403	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.497490345339	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.499127024144	to save a company.
0.0	0.49949630376	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.504924758742	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.49713476868	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.497998308179	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.48206984939	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.498604825467	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.498416657679	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.495788857568	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.499007042228	Check it out.
0.0	0.502149550938	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.496932700989	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.498742575283	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.505105466177	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.500433135543	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.520944425477	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.500371883415	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.4985290173	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.497492155145	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.499199441284	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.499827512661	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.49701171599	...Chris...
0.0	0.517889112931	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.49927623835	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.494239465463	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.499811458375	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.500057954362	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.496742887896	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.499369743128	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.483361682831	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.499305860071	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.498836316525	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.500141061009	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
1.0	0.504220768135	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.500869978984	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.511003274641	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
1.0	0.506321254159	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.499962634773	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.498788785869	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.499200269498	No, no.
0.0	0.486455052054	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.502368875541	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.49687565692	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.499078411171	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.499160947305	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
1.0	0.497704840072	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.498184609488	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.498476898965	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.496283688953	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.502867714502	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."

0.0	0.498646713052	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.

0.0	0.500495536568	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.50045199152	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.500844802943	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.502039263685	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.498387312056	And you know what?
0.0	0.506029469888	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
1.0	0.50727834029	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.496736321326	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.498321302573	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.500855358549	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.500376110503	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.498431899656	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.499258698669	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.488201552438	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
1.0	0.49985669316	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.499152509358	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.

1.0	0.500811895212	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.480134626969	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.499549957298	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
1.0	0.505363059895	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.499372627854	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.501168680629	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.500078310718	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.504438436253	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.502831657231	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.498321172417	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.500100712515	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.499690189082	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.497303486766	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.497304641033	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.500084138179	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.478366863555	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.499397022926	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.500887357455	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.499794923297	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.502771276067	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.486224268495	The answer is no.
0.0	0.503272540133	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.502006603938	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.499462324034	What have you got now?
0.0	0.499010980204	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.498918413825	You know that.
0.0	0.49921698426	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.498855589266	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.498752130313	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.500190474658	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.50022713342	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.500878417726	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.496940390254	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.50123814891	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.499777026938	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.511120759129	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.482674249509	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.499852696447	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.478943113142	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.479347441555	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.498768080143	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.498691041119	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.499246820187	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.495988217761	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.497254769331	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.498999343694	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.497222488511	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.502609336532	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.498075934091	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.495598126454	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.509439823083	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.498778060372	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.487546648868	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.500309343367	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.503393738893	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.499510091388	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.4985549527	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.480968745146	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.503962937747	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.495823245796	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.500117208199	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.486113156338	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.499815338191	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.500283632759	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.501190268284	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.496530191927	I have no illusion.
1.0	0.499835117646	They were wrong.
0.0	0.498357547246	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.501817669659	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.500834240786	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.500559573612	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.504977317592	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.512660332208	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.495708281878	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.481479352953	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.498970919804	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.500100582152	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.498433868592	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.497258514902	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.478568465438	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.499411668152	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.486997985025	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.500431288497	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.49989295363	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.504730036414	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.499292108266	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.50361016844	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.5001580573	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
1.0	0.499749098415	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.476202803789	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.493350718573	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.494247238307	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.490189680399	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.499294388165	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.500129918886	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.500339188513	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.500418906002	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.500033530802	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.487036184975	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.481519547029	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.500088603896	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.500203359685	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.499801566141	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.495596478626	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.500203241318	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.500933636251	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.501394723616	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.498928468606	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.497769838633	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.500712657716	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.503796627798	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.50549066627	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.498944508111	That's my bill.
0.0	0.498888990675	Say again?
0.0	0.499281659577	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.483409170246	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.500033692796	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.500654585697	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.500149086819	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.500800877347	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.500939649488	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.500595229417	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.496482224892	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.493001463113	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.497233015133	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.499042934826	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.503022365445	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.500287471891	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.500320132706	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?

0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.497416292168	Now, we're going to blame the people.
1.0	0.508490561345	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.500694578801	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.49211065264	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.516992885765	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.480358343192	Creativity.
0.0	0.500775468092	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.

0.0	0.497565968079	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.501303727667	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.496945448194	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.498470424171	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.495079879086	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.499380309999	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.500342964885	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.480133218903	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.498298161502	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.498458667483	How great is that?
0.0	0.496701852228	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.499126645097	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.480099656817	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.485521205405	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.49601744424	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.502113528037	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.498115691661	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.499292086064	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.50288012929	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.501073105387	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.498342806305	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.481605972204	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.498270354703	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.508560028527	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.501775356798	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.496103542332	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.498103890618	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.4962028856	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.498710060784	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.507539791616	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.49923242783	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.501977913238	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.499774307638	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.496963374347	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.501040446683	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.494735021365	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.498834452749	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.496354602088	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.498915367081	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.495821755229	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.499209663693	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.499357799207	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.497787437114	We can't do this unilaterally.
1.0	0.503945135531	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.498884036589	And for good cause.
0.0	0.498104309353	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.509526842522	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.501004082116	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.505183579365	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.507139084228	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.498459012173	It's their money.
0.0	0.520044946338	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.500445543918	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.504246871058	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.497213478329	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.500070893198	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.499386137622	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.500671606324	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.493209896534	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.496598015207	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.499155764295	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.492301041244	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.500796565448	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.498934638581	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.499635840639	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.499746812435	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.498614050457	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.500517013276	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.495483574725	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.498610207816	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.485835826755	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.497697619038	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.506424256371	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.499163761911	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.501538357281	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.520251232994	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.499905056531	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.500170453877	I totally get that.
0.0	0.500489921837	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.499932965399	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.502084814828	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.498326292345	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.501612257276	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.484778978102	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.48260824084	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.515400180256	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.498642564893	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.503017468979	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.499135419759	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.502161432889	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.500542869914	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.497837823394	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.496666179925	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.499985705847	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.50016377601	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.493482458211	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.499581675668	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.501466376259	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.498097098982	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.502151002535	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.503900666924	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.504650024076	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.

0.0	0.498560759028	About Medicare?
0.0	0.481701153832	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.500603955046	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.497570558021	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.500415616834	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.458456746964	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.482910034368	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.499711763185	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.495254859113	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
1.0	0.50760053731	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.499810022208	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.499033763412	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.480650205422	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.495718500898	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.495728504604	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.49910489833	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
1.0	0.500089976525	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.500489690364	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.499585436511	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.495787204026	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.496246244198	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.500670142254	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.497380941924	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.499087272968	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.491357992085	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.484346201288	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.49707292965	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.49769755792	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.499231066601	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.50071666002	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.497003601639	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.501982052976	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.496285192077	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.499351239419	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.499195655584	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.500972772597	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.498365139856	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.485345010903	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.501247702396	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.479691796769	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.500356943702	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.496079310229	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.501859256654	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.498862100412	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.500265779692	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.499869449968	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.497864934471	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.499198922341	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.501398416887	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.4979597931	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.497939157724	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.497099731255	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.498217120678	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.501506581974	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.501607238011	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.500916221657	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.49925098244	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.49845443017	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.479546843322	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.484077641945	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.518196342869	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.49998350431	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.495275215594	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.49956991188	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.500485821129	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.500193699012	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.499994394758	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.480808150847	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.499485723352	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.499017314404	And God bless America.
0.0	0.498706981665	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.500929667285	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.482337349909	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.496324116152	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.502095754662	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.498513409402	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.498179686621	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.500116755226	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.510065234007	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.500503859982	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.498465167594	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.481181474056	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.500198258835	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.506082102563	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.498784667103	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.4993044706	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.497905243961	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.499003359882	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
1.0	0.499411147063	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.500128650509	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.499418668914	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.499937726227	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.499667435643	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.498769959459	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.500499384179	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.509013735034	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.49563419348	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.501083427668	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.500203052503	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.498331529076	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.479116198844	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.500540186673	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.499114464959	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.494367600642	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.480310823042	Again...
0.0	0.498037845156	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
1.0	0.516042508681	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.503550754384	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.498042916002	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.500817622685	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.501907691571	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.498095154493	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.500130823975	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.505253646319	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.501147497329	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.498961962064	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.495968967817	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.499396278933	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.495282939648	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.501600442309	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.500007737453	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.502172328281	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.499846128764	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.499719543046	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
1.0	0.501401455947	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.498152780405	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.497913193481	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.497183367832	But look...
0.0	0.499068573363	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.499223110532	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.48719940747	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.495428403846	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.498490130447	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.499629621743	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.478410357213	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.497742080302	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.480874760964	Absolutely.
0.0	0.499895476366	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.499336309773	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.507793317531	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.498471665535	We do.
0.0	0.500534338803	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.500032510194	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.480874760964	Right.
0.0	0.498519775727	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.501714085522	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.499670541391	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.499499554354	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.498986332619	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.492716321506	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.487747270166	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.501248300665	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.499856226708	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.482901200192	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.500557781946	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.49870039423	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.503915488587	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.500116819398	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.500201530726	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.501099851754	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.498471665535	Thank you.
0.0	0.50113913726	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.494678646408	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.498652103052	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.504384460624	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.500708918459	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.496238037245	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.49743651547	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.500352014539	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.498425899081	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.498011908965	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.497701411296	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.501121866926	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.499737624066	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.500257396726	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.500272170464	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.499830005312	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.502571508758	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.503961354193	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.49911883016	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.480458056886	No.
0.0	0.499836085949	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.501404227888	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.501578157624	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.501500395241	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.497881769253	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.50091978428	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.503721592742	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.502687289135	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.499195270583	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.500839288287	I don't care.
0.0	0.504955548103	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.

0.0	0.51599782811	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.501619706728	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.510006256014	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.501063957345	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.498460338568	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.498696738663	What should we do?

0.0	0.499281505677	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.499579496987	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.

0.0	0.493593466816	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.50753525294	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.513887327416	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.497667692506	And I want to make this our government.

0.0	0.49700845237	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.499658724846	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.

0.0	0.498850430257	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.498402344554	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
1.0	0.502634242984	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.499195210359	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.502206994396	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.498392634531	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.500830214689	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.499518702666	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.496017509998	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.498360976586	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.498052671471	I want to take care of women.

0.0	0.498082905244	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.498387312056	But you know what?
0.0	0.499955650193	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.501221703029	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.478254840073	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.499379618087	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.500587143969	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.500206862473	Of course not.
0.0	0.481795721525	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.503497209827	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.497667109883	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.499018059572	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.500249004956	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.50032272086	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.502054164791	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.481479729846	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.503165353871	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.485034963268	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.499079339991	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.49591639506	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.495640184398	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.500437973678	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.498760438416	It's true.
0.0	0.500566646411	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.478492851118	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.499087736744	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.510066816214	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.500253259007	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.499668320013	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.500042087297	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.479587053502	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.516191096822	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.498696804488	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.504964653921	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.505043830112	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.479767112487	Maria...
0.0	0.498350744613	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.499112800322	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.497377885588	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.502281534658	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.495735685281	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.499745039875	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.50513680726	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.503090456398	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.483208745265	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.518758502873	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.499590404708	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.499874724527	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.50000197137	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.496447882333	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.500336522342	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.482826889654	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.501138762847	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.497037417611	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.511923133168	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.496973594607	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.502028725728	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.504305497863	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.497706655265	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.497584174277	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.499494014473	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.500294559456	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.498807520037	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.500007111706	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.500912733713	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.495899136449	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.498529769063	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.479894155894	...
0.0	0.498815613131	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.524604754274	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.499223386297	Wait for what?
0.0	0.500571482707	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.480874760964	Absolutely.
0.0	0.499682930713	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.503793141144	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.466286920832	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.499089762018	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.498863959904	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.500571083516	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.499747287894	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.502952218501	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.501977785854	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.502652138849	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.49497463785	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.496879790973	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.501914730659	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.500858385792	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.500655028637	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.499126215502	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.49751749476	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.499167331876	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.485003737624	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.498849981919	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.5013756074	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.498471665535	I do.
0.0	0.495549373819	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.499710244777	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.500365303426	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.498231264765	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.501305424611	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.498184908033	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.493538970165	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.497790131854	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.498237474536	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.49828022435	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.498098298975	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.497458852998	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.483966670511	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.500546260345	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.499027442079	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.482504935936	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.491282645358	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.499215302432	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.497954517244	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.499397064201	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.496327748293	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.500054688052	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.480533115532	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.501633892735	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
1.0	0.50176201189	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.499560242882	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.500123800934	You really can't.
0.0	0.498501204517	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.501681498158	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.496600257741	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.498908669027	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.501015456682	We would still have racism holding people back.
