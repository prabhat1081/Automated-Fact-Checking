1.0	0.263278407363	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.853426008697	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.00506693298628	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.166064883656	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.0975601114755	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.160550507078	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.778956455341	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.184592495244	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.718018709424	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.158586732877	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.857544403401	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.0967389409279	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.141226102988	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.131802006204	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.0583612091537	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.925232507396	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.869914707094	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.844389148969	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.0860079423729	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.898660066527	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.822863019458	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.231068106337	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.0578380070596	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
1.0	0.831277753565	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.113721629133	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.105917824894	I will do that.
0.0	0.727335351979	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.409508847409	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.792182481793	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	3.03881504156e-06	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.00176419081058	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.830126495359	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.488592946174	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.834503078718	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.897059621337	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.097130929499	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.815426003308	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.0839952147255	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.767998999277	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.153240645834	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.722268216326	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.00176419081058	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.0930823361989	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.747358974334	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.232182624864	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.123307917249	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.284822026964	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.0772308616257	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.856030387054	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
1.0	0.24408702413	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.715096318678	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.0921956432343	It never happens.
0.0	0.0713863841166	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.147919389257	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.969279327296	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.885919621743	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.578049037785	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.93070280373	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.171971944078	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.31829675043	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.197845299326	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.921757283386	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.0818239749577	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.760998637744	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.00176419081058	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.0683515625459	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
1.0	0.899206474826	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.066857160856	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.83763038388	I never said that.
0.0	0.075909775097	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.0196084226754	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.800689660945	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.957417002888	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.0924973330884	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.114564600714	You do.
0.0	0.119473284891	That's right.
0.0	0.84171400988	That's all I'm saying.
1.0	0.182534881653	Median wages have stagnated.
1.0	0.921644566774	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.693222512325	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.102341510214	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.0797558702573	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.0572393842764	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.121894622066	And, we said no.
0.0	0.249117468743	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.060977384606	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.125738488495	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.184005322345	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.417267691315	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.145937048729	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.109443761986	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.845738997558	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.0675205313531	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.901742693792	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.787428312719	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.110576056338	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.104482857972	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.8600825457	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.105933490582	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.863779730046	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.0719388025757	Becky --
0.0	0.179313701942	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.663180540134	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.850438453959	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.00176419081058	There are lids on people's aspirations.
1.0	0.340850852078	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.918134037501	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.0905811157296	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.063255114475	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.803549254548	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.815612948799	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.870006714524	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.82412022829	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.169059677664	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.84279932446	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.734814872182	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.927771830779	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.0726694190934	So I have voiced criticisms.
1.0	0.959707759253	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
1.0	0.864881494421	They stole it.
0.0	0.758205082898	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.181392218735	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.846963677485	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.818758588287	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.645828650454	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.0918635820384	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.0686689706752	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.879102116385	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.141436904937	And you know what?
0.0	6.36443263665e-08	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.855846505046	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.182334780269	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.845505099058	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.0943588208473	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.0852995627767	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.880211194554	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.0906591011068	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.0774873828628	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.100104096441	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.169046624783	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.144009682628	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.819691383517	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.0775479656727	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.740639649048	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.0884889391273	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.947888896351	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
1.0	0.890506340538	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.861769055545	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.0611952266425	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.114564600714	I do.
0.0	0.00176419081058	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.225524020936	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.109546838818	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.835630736567	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	1.72930782091e-05	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.142388309416	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.0881693635837	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
1.0	0.803582722549	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.106018349303	I don't like that.
0.0	0.936973832024	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.0696991866412	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.712795713538	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.731591598484	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.12842310297	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.837531464012	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.0967389409279	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.107910041651	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.138342246999	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.149073836938	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.209691848247	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.834607417989	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.913629875826	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.0758454709889	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.836890526122	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.118286643625	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.846772251886	Of course not.
0.0	0.0577770536273	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.252479625957	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.79871958689	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
1.0	0.820522418286	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.924835661458	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.764359221228	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.0800691965847	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.888350365008	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.0964051941395	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.89198937688	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.908391090023	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.155546670832	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.817199913367	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.691876785816	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.

0.0	0.0806684750389	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.

0.0	0.0916174698533	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.905817333268	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.140288225073	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.09017610248	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.

0.0	0.117197656599	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.832841986434	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.110532583379	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.0427207520281	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.745877958133	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.133356178259	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.11812288514	No, he doesn't.

0.0	0.954055345027	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.807053762442	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.145290973765	OK, good.
0.0	0.939701234738	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.

0.0	0.72556684059	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.

0.0	0.9212880171	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.0730054211895	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.

0.0	0.111699280287	Let me just -- let me respond.
1.0	9.20986844186e-15	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
1.0	0.828671018847	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.114684034291	No.
0.0	0.00176419081058	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.0665808033605	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.0929448568187	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.314251778896	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.088282664197	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.0826997682351	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.0043888464026	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.79929527857	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.88796675846	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
1.0	0.937153491241	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.133250769672	And for good cause.
0.0	0.825828774203	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.156022810868	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.116361731899	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
1.0	0.752948727401	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.828133737311	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.781591517079	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.0598736814289	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.0868335428479	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0590979476442	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.939220451171	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.315447314258	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.212297016156	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
1.0	0.110741671932	They were wrong.
0.0	0.855580476212	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.074510901497	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.19395936845	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.0862964968368	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.0823222249889	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.0545734072165	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.821502449878	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.107143754487	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.0677437736464	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.0718205513406	...John...
0.0	0.872607546657	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.836303153522	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.219350304169	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.908786695422	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.00362742041373	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.825128623988	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
1.0	0.967163348827	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.82473048206	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.852583790831	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.0100751940619	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.852782431496	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.834309569459	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.00176419081058	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.0277603588601	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.114694231603	This will end.
0.0	0.85751081863	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.570058729991	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.12319086067	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.138466061428	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
1.0	0.915345441065	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.0640583784342	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.100354664741	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.177235479695	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.164218166026	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
1.0	0.871123253997	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.787653121048	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.102422857584	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.0875213283872	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.0791274094432	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.836588199163	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.828572100473	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.819366561364	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.156607261506	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.927464730605	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.168294698441	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.916628134049	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.751727296392	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
1.0	0.914345771679	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.960719218245	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.220728319842	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.249023679386	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.099114963006	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.135583312583	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.842556592641	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.743041149962	Why didn't they call?
1.0	0.821922092558	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.740313138733	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.142974698806	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.00176419081058	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.11235227562	John.
0.0	0.0735305313744	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.0615438638383	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.133479128588	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.733993451995	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.982599652816	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.103677896354	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.106617741285	Thank you.
0.0	0.837177222946	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.0862525362479	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
1.0	0.828790349409	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.851670053642	They were wrong.
0.0	0.124199075457	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.672215836425	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.0728563244141	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.153617802097	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.175539839516	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.0774594408044	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.872618729948	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.128901295906	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.191345693588	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.915430854384	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.850782218917	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.761895873618	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.146114283266	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.112710252911	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.00196856768723	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.0831184274759	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.0735634912344	He's wrong.
0.0	0.0548275995032	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.892991509732	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.152296318058	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.135426578724	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.103516325538	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.199329685976	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	1.16915140887e-28	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.0852928355053	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.118259368035	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.00239180163479	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.0953609412704	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.00176419081058	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.832219955399	Good at email.
0.0	0.148896521903	We need sound money.
0.0	0.245827170529	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.0647557070853	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.0831928775741	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.310450698644	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.00176419081058	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.743928761548	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.120243626394	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.00176419081058	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.73095363968	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.924332907082	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.0735064433967	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.74253354952	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.0982291573028	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.0699041359141	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.753622403303	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.125880457129	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.111055796095	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.0755025017535	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.0851401463743	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.102116538991	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.112855327117	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.094978894765	Right.
0.0	0.129325901315	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.144385708163	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	1.01837512643e-11	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.100974156411	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.116944167041	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.145426757987	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.837412826811	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.164803775961	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.0619380072116	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.0669883753324	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.0879810497662	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.117290424364	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	5.60057349175e-06	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.898379638422	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.118363707514	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.913145440824	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.112696720633	And I want to make this our government.
1.0	0.00176419081058	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.182202002039	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.00176419081058	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.752966476254	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.126441387995	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.0943306010575	Yeah.
0.0	0.0929527935225	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.105222843073	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.893187575041	Credibility counts.
1.0	0.826003329524	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.107534267272	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.0251433117545	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.106018349303	They don't like that.
0.0	0.114549475868	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.177994351265	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.16044036634	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	5.42481614491e-05	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.974936110153	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.880198309393	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.114331571829	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.084785799129	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.121265727609	I would change them.
0.0	0.894452862391	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
1.0	0.964641599513	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.0329694391978	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
1.0	0.710232938425	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.0728949701372	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.814415079278	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.120315858374	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.752524702998	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.0166206724886	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.358817929127	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.925578475077	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.0703440740207	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.22584760463	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.760369253247	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.904752061303	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.0855992112648	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.0872039619311	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.101799591575	You're right.
0.0	0.865652681534	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.107944054614	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.954605289381	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.118717017703	They're a scam.
0.0	0.0134797689068	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.156084362765	That's fine.
0.0	0.101317150357	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.783926006473	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.147210505402	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.131682050056	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.0948795550458	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
1.0	0.895030049867	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.0640583784342	We have a country of laws.
1.0	1.47968369111e-08	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.805791271473	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
1.0	0.799331881828	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.207355509171	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.899108026949	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.121260740155	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.0669791367884	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.851029559103	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.106072811147	See?
0.0	0.00176419081058	And here's why.
0.0	0.0743649965785	I think you're --
0.0	0.102354640507	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.816438372692	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.801917443594	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.0850148183063	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.829570580754	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.859842546107	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.933488556001	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.744748168816	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.161916427497	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.0605961833339	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.0788708017299	No -- no...
0.0	0.0711442918076	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.827896658662	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.867059466735	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.0885407791607	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.0883794786912	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.0748871614866	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.772731561209	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.228937516137	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.10349513649	That's what he is.
0.0	0.817962776983	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.173173320776	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.0761848157	We were wrong.
0.0	0.213497230367	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.103769272321	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.821316674882	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.09111003479	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.0864260160114	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
1.0	0.859006554407	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.0926861907397	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.0661418476584	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.0946208029036	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.0746206498252	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.0814036172322	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.161323699849	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.888543534293	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.0780524042129	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.129951024271	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.0686948919075	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.436535907369	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.0993094540147	You're welcome.
0.0	0.703937105088	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.0878016688004	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.77958455989	Well, a couple of things.
1.0	0.0756236455338	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.0916145719716	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.0874392897957	But this is nothing new.
0.0	1.02399272495e-14	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.121169032873	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.831169921327	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.733904465824	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.0692604761236	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.0610001232182	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.126594713876	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.102462482525	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.160662553716	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.13340564291	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.925387516301	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.16762109265	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.827124165547	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.00556959146715	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.0815834052554	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.879477681823	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.298212412894	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.897896492057	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.912917529956	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.076736613303	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.818447327086	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.114684034291	No.
0.0	0.104375033414	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.11055368553	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.807726328396	Progressives don't believe that.
1.0	0.800097334365	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.108317156694	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.00258976543179	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.106606218735	You count on it.
1.0	0.943636843088	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.080584870301	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.114684034291	No.
0.0	0.167759374686	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.100957973997	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.100452046839	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	1.28783436727e-09	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.000403610514042	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.00419644236908	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.0249446244576	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.128326368234	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.0446499602538	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.100351954085	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
1.0	0.7175495558	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.862097152021	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.685524558701	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.858492584192	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.766798094943	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.0933564989184	I think he is right.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.213828974862	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.141024813685	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.89402697278	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.0559491522243	...
0.0	0.855166121356	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.

0.0	0.82804583403	My point is this.

0.0	0.190519553573	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.200228812631	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.

0.0	0.141445622662	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.0816587028342	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.0943306010575	Yes.
0.0	0.00176419081058	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.110041964383	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.855525257574	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.842876237137	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.

0.0	0.0142521809948	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.175864966426	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.275254814327	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.00176419081058	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.0800846805535	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.

0.0	0.734356468233	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.126303517413	I said no.
0.0	0.868874116336	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.0922927439768	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.763860151064	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.0583470515373	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.990660304746	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.89912260697	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.714717965024	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.930284340925	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.00272625473689	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.118045971241	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.0775956689145	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.848023248344	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.822595940626	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.169877717567	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.724762074595	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.216438331087	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	3.8334281686e-13	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.25645730856	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.14212005939	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
1.0	0.972589996644	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.752758467652	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.

1.0	0.987659675606	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.955672578627	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.

0.0	7.78702675102e-05	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.117506976047	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.0819361343283	We're going to cut costs.

0.0	0.400816512893	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.909459659546	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.786881517933	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.155004818637	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.0808407883509	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
1.0	0.80824770342	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.

0.0	0.193930174188	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.00673858004014	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.117756820757	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.00488333405299	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.

0.0	0.815032588463	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.0830304018826	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.171766767706	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.830602504858	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.670314994398	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.207778605483	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.0845400520467	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
1.0	0.967321719102	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
1.0	0.947289584724	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.0995321659414	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.116424608706	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.118514283822	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.744962594413	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.194764439717	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.0946765083668	slot.
0.0	0.755728358437	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.157879688732	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.0798726556445	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.681493332283	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	7.03914697032e-08	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.874282172671	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.126802181893	They're very concerned about it.

0.0	0.895644066436	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.892375879872	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.199403105268	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.119649788161	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.942207609733	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.186499090672	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.212559996053	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.0638248830304	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.124301306756	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.0921956432343	It goes away.
0.0	0.072516087038	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.734297542763	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.0573606092578	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.136652296241	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.

0.0	0.0774307307223	You've got to keep asking.

0.0	0.117002016363	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.00249024908764	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.0879256505598	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.0943519641748	Now, let me just be clear, John.

0.0	2.85470449257e-35	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	1.50220660351e-16	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.

0.0	0.0816088860777	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.0891612568748	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.060806976078	And so do I.
0.0	0.000311722415741	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.889024307144	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.873542723183	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.863665956462	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.765728170794	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.0634971195289	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.133274783755	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.0943306010575	OK?
1.0	0.977312647295	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.844114402193	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.0680751404644	Why is that?
0.0	0.00176419081058	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.850718322116	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.753439740002	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.0677959105167	We're running.
0.0	0.903057864346	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.878368718473	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.0172921890633	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.0916796829913	It's a joke.
0.0	0.250274146454	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.0920579617644	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.120636823791	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	1.99967596242e-24	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.813503888902	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	4.02793140246e-06	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.114564600714	We do.
0.0	0.762754218439	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.196442861149	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.162423986159	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
1.0	0.968017800444	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.0896054353501	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.862503335325	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.0745450967286	How great is that?
0.0	0.146936514347	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.0758787848137	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.191903169363	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.0706612432182	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.0925834519205	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.14445350742	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	3.2614818516e-13	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.905356958925	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.159566432833	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.102410830733	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.786249371223	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.959499780082	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.00176419081058	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.120472052424	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.107541955705	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.121614059712	Here's a fact.
0.0	8.77183538093e-19	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.131844060259	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.155745644558	That's the difference.
0.0	0.746289152225	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.103296572669	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.902533388371	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.00176419081058	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.1599062012	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.102678561313	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.0605731784188	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.0559491522243	...
0.0	0.892805638838	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.11881477001	We can do that in Washington.
1.0	0.917065183074	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.793480102549	No their not.
0.0	0.0857715563395	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.880350083332	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.743089986601	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.873451210117	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.0972046711941	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.146127213494	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	6.75764624763e-29	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.742177322574	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.815983973577	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.894581688211	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.827726592003	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.850565475464	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.931847354691	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.904200424567	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.00176419081058	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.0802922458672	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.1204161545	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.112722346709	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.0750270351744	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.166491029856	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.0949328718199	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.784497567653	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.0660809671577	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.0945660352799	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.101464534412	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.0821786990021	In addition to that...
0.0	0.131304589935	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.0585527369762	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.139627534043	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.108664116443	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.12842310297	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.835669219685	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.905436469096	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.0852124262476	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.271464163951	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.180851578623	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.807610146742	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.702527904677	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.165256331103	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.69993368482	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.127316467873	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.0628507703915	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.00176419081058	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.751972260928	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.0960858111229	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.0883951426803	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.133076327606	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.111475029279	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.121763263347	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.921252617319	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.0752631983475	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.811408333065	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.117598812702	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.0637175035686	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.0924026573619	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.0980292804863	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.863311032797	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.0985550561766	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.00537679952369	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.071986129839	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.897153770626	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.108556999451	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.105886759233	So I'm doing great.

0.0	0.0570741174839	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.0346206798717	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.

0.0	0.00176419081058	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.744699393797	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.899736337795	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.797268189684	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.

1.0	0.141012545592	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	1.4770088361e-09	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.879068334986	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.947958338338	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.

0.0	0.0967389409279	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	9.16800035854e-05	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.892246184399	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.130495601642	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.761081592313	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.761896833146	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.0807410734281	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.869128651274	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.838880370674	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.00176419081058	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.11071845694	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.847814015247	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.072773265454	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.225182486335	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.0587311702476	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.792993617671	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.0585518446701	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.937817577761	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.0225681703024	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.759762519328	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	9.81597829903e-11	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.0840659020859	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.0246531449224	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.136798181633	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.0634186086026	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.793801666964	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.0844731898827	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.106183808285	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.156816618633	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.139080769359	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	4.95645712338e-07	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.779441589829	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.131935161657	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.87341321221	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.0749630930052	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.00176419081058	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.104153769974	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.0965656368663	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.148704220822	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.140296258737	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.0970132345892	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.116518140653	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.0749354942297	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.843627185632	I know every one.
0.0	0.232477464846	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.223412201832	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.0974870486628	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.101216352946	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.0555237989564	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.0689993027351	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.319861447462	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.167358042154	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.100068455335	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.0562648472607	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.114197782418	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.768942451033	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
1.0	0.0988020887137	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.115063964441	It's their money.
0.0	0.167750192013	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.889568743583	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.216714033632	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.00176419081058	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.654030475922	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.0822267730431	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.241704550954	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.0878392025891	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.714399433252	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.0820179531589	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.693089876167	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.183372788586	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.778608373005	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.086245528897	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.890386806108	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.803672781841	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.330128926094	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.106715103331	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.0588337840714	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.711919494574	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.719431282561	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.872626918161	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.138099458965	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.0691962121646	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.779739506576	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.89308302288	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.0651769045982	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.818214056049	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.856396342315	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.103789607602	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.774394956119	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.929916886803	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.160322200306	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.751920347199	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.00176419081058	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.217056314326	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
1.0	0.896748512051	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.776641431954	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.00231181262632	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.195965362693	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.75316048716	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.0729428944845	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
1.0	0.871083530275	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.148513005471	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.652726635449	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.975142136811	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.131838145584	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.884393050973	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.834895105859	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.9055343587	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.982586027873	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.122581334424	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.0815974874337	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	1.07910829178e-05	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.112200053602	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.0930306726419	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.858051694698	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.808387345258	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
1.0	0.890507196633	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.831066745992	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.107275823611	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.0995697880539	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.111820384128	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.0544441120173	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.1010272163	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.781545359205	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
1.0	0.441525791976	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.107441635109	I like that.
0.0	0.74932332371	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.143498360754	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.

0.0	0.141436904937	And you know what?
0.0	1.59941300987e-09	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.738694564833	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.

0.0	0.757627585491	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.104141030509	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.707349360553	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.856475691425	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.00176419081058	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.866069238687	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.679316469151	That has not been...
0.0	0.0776095853212	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.89708516977	But the average person takes out about $350,000.

0.0	0.121287672879	I understand.
0.0	0.0581653847074	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.398581040178	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.847596426704	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.781768239092	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.00176419081058	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.371685698564	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.

0.0	0.107534487757	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.0573873340875	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.0665226274155	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.00329215791244	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	1.01043583579e-41	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.835089981143	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.148896521903	We need sound money.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.158818357246	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.

0.0	0.102763522653	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.121971972645	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.

0.0	0.735221013671	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.288093051238	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.0940515802942	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.81449464721	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.0604738600409	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.929042079286	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.134423573917	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.0541454145832	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.841503403878	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.062252719843	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.0868025946082	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.0900922404471	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.

0.0	0.070512943978	The time to act is now.
1.0	0.943573593717	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.

0.0	0.0559491522243	...
0.0	0.078413008546	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.125961669401	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.0712171791837	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.119905452533	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.

0.0	0.119517767542	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.0898018063659	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.117872163879	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.188873240213	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.946284504184	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.161695603936	The world has changed.
0.0	0.00391533904839	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.0622382143526	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.120662684189	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.835855781498	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.103133233389	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.960657687134	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.177640641542	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.891335324841	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.828734097625	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.0653358090987	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.202955653798	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.0951910709344	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.144396088799	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.00176419081058	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.860226821635	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.106617741285	Thank you.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I've laid out...
0.0	0.111442052493	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.120100657198	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.150006282696	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.0167677054782	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.805250349361	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.330114310308	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.0666391759436	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.068282767597	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.105294527344	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.404516418365	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.757768184948	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.928229453581	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.682073278955	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.107170672208	I can.
0.0	0.804889761653	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.156682135336	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
1.0	0.865302954437	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.0631547645467	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.884496388075	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.0721205463611	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.257731706776	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.854107813608	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.057401962776	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.885381449306	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.862610280907	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.147569796031	I'm ready.
0.0	0.0963696648538	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.00928286837078	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.905388315147	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.0975520245661	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.895846208269	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.833857157143	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.111981937949	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.108266097703	Do we have answer for that?
1.0	0.119520949256	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
1.0	0.0770525841403	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.0898455305977	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.0226551479879	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.907089685803	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.0933658968551	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.783687444543	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.0019254978054	In all due respect...
0.0	0.756559502395	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0118351391962	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.0609414096965	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.837204444958	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	1.40711903139e-08	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.917392694094	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.133658512315	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.0983593533948	Well, sure.
0.0	0.12366943348	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.701097175179	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.0782792366227	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.149320686806	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.724545887126	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.0904360724613	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.10330226853	On welfare.
0.0	0.076781051037	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.770560060467	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.094978894765	Ever.
0.0	0.122621230993	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.81517587841	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.10653476174	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	3.13706855646e-08	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.1668388948	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.70213629516	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.175189015443	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.122056174974	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.740384063966	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.143054710408	No, John.
0.0	0.105569790453	I don't care.
1.0	0.927170255995	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.903814686704	You do legislation.

0.0	0.928293705634	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.16438298839	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.109170454316	We don't win.
0.0	3.91284928964e-41	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.866925610467	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.0760257662434	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.151415995798	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.896018748953	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.

0.0	0.114684034291	No.
0.0	0.104213062848	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.949072637778	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.064325967679	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.0936154237811	Illegal.
0.0	0.141158611611	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.0892832120902	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.00218321339181	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.

0.0	0.10907628719	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.102514449178	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.0892012173388	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...

0.0	0.0828702349615	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.116193193006	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.847066593091	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.0913192648266	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	2.04013183551e-05	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.0913655308091	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.938530111897	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.711327466159	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.109845195693	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.711337302877	Why didn't they call the police?

0.0	0.806178680854	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.

0.0	0.782179822333	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.0728359602489	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.115081292566	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.1928214174	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.885964726537	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.882306827359	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.810063324481	She was right.

0.0	0.62481398408	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.11765686426	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.102317642899	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.181500236824	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.934404836285	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.719882694314	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.122598792344	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.733995266751	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.111606818959	But guess who pushed for that regulation?

0.0	0.13261701942	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.786917847486	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.0860592521769	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.822162118629	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.109776807766	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.0871973112606	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.101049943338	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.927224958698	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.0245002200055	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.11810139619	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.907820986065	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.

0.0	0.801998155612	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.759307634442	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.286373388753	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.0771936807248	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.815451096594	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.0931480929299	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.303102966397	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.851721577471	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.809665340484	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.

0.0	0.79754636955	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.0611308112476	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.

0.0	0.113360739391	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.171368378012	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.953959760996	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.0931462586897	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.860711338963	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.000131581448879	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.0722943558744	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.90879623249	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.800733573756	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
1.0	0.957012377431	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.924347403585	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.112338692918	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.115751304366	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
1.0	0.883970907111	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.908959434221	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.094978894765	Right.
0.0	0.00176419081058	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.847631712846	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.0905255906523	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.895712621457	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.865624243584	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.0769374967385	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.111645899014	About Medicare?
0.0	0.884259771081	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.771315970808	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.00224327271571	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.0932347129186	The answer is no.
0.0	0.83763038388	I never said that.
0.0	0.823798100328	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.643157046925	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.0710733356518	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.0835991256858	That's my view.
0.0	0.104020815046	He was on the board.
0.0	0.0876504263211	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.742468450024	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.0837551006375	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.00176419081058	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.810628261875	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.137041435685	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.118744880185	But we're not gambling.
0.0	2.1686108931e-11	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.0681780757047	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.000623890744816	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.0810839738602	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.

0.0	0.881724893226	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.084456958202	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.0986965460167	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.164892090761	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.114268103414	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.943437965853	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.258211008961	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.190478837506	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.784199565841	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.787612934342	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.840408649022	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.112215299387	to save a company.
0.0	0.975917701633	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.914410559067	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.153902931339	A brief response.
0.0	0.0651554902186	And why?
0.0	0.00176419081058	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.884903115831	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.789473892943	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.267364218498	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.075119665661	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.110519537729	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.0721580908434	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.00423592788491	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.135832254937	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.135125568159	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.0943306010575	Okay.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.1288086669	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.775977040441	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.215394593545	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.0741253791643	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.0766591785173	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.108727572777	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.940209961777	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.933663543278	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.

0.0	0.264894719172	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.

0.0	0.0631168908392	You just want to...
0.0	0.00326385312543	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.920397629895	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.

0.0	0.866814120262	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.188800399104	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.14238923752	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.444273774839	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0752178075445	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.946649920772	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.0849920775728	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.09476373482	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.0945541160335	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.776955830326	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.891532142318	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.840239809702	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.841738623318	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.908359523451	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.139082673158	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.120425379691	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.872986900465	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.882379704141	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.0512195741601	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.0974674861271	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.742412073018	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.00421697745461	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.928068408002	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.

0.0	0.781260467349	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	5.93902016672e-09	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.907982082227	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.136343018968	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.0887343459245	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.887857357709	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.103958688382	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.109815323735	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.106617741285	Thank you.
0.0	0.917446425527	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.734414749417	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.0979830337164	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.0867871573811	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.00176419081058	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.0633686170533	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.114914387522	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.135385231853	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.0671827198033	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.790994473589	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.0878374388229	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.128123736094	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.15286949399	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.0561777681897	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.0859548083117	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.318001583742	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.00679729780818	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.771897794131	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.12972174845	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.103985041448	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.00285389447946	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.185635808014	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.159914192246	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.139344461046	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.110447727898	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.126126933973	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.114893398727	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.942548584199	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.0626148813643	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.16835596154	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.0670435772645	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.0614474045271	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.351210457959	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
1.0	0.716744069675	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.0646761275755	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.00177068153835	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.945965392167	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.91136899863	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.111582682504	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.662383488904	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.815458678198	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.00176419081058	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.13673603549	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.643011342986	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.0944058385993	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.858301703614	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.188132775742	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.0882439034694	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.142242612355	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.878703162981	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.090391180211	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.0919317394212	He's wrong.
0.0	0.0873467362768	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.0714712212926	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.825452963228	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.0661711920265	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	4.60206900399e-09	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.144075802193	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.147971619374	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.799335776991	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.122393237362	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.812356157839	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.72628888249	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.966593920738	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.0743039531861	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.0947438090959	And we are not England.
0.0	0.0571301331243	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.13249665097	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.0792416553212	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.0986357393856	in particular.
0.0	0.930700875729	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.218410901838	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.101869051939	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.00291564189795	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.155672586442	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.759804979179	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.0666206206255	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.880476100999	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.838075108754	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.968788925055	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.114692508375	What should we do?
0.0	0.862858216795	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.908216777045	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.887534319247	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.078092831335	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.137856495297	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.0577293634674	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.111016150541	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.0926260484532	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.942616395684	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.933115317342	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.128926146348	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.0184114972262	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.00176419081058	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.0762907235673	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.800055581845	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.072781325373	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.169115977909	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.912977780682	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.740401359835	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.863272044806	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.0699257749962	He undermines it.
1.0	0.155110431542	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.13684820686	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.0797973245788	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.100864997682	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.810272340658	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.130999222783	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.0683362401674	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.0830263109092	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.00176419081058	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.161560342485	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.0892624076432	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.100496541524	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.841548497546	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.0866879717129	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.992226507585	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.878389839016	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.834473111701	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.211115519334	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.181006647539	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	1.46769240733e-12	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.0943306010575	OK?
0.0	0.943660212633	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.0784346495494	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.0718658430304	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.331195462196	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.729284017155	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.0874923566814	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.145093839011	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.86679587691	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.0680256862417	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.13583422683	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.265757734944	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.00623584444648	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.100699015734	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.946065907232	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.0740738073137	That's good.
0.0	0.837108066534	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.

0.0	0.814743122705	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.

0.0	0.229873618737	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.160825565473	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.00680030405928	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.213085423522	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.748696505287	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.835163391791	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.0699040435487	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.80888524053	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.

0.0	0.784973289685	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.160614209512	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.07949842673	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.862176595321	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.

0.0	0.155525956887	Atlantic City has gone bad.

0.0	0.844883003753	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.130381965991	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.

0.0	0.0898541949209	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.286574425715	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.944514707287	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.0735599186168	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.00589377238148	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.106617741285	Thank you.
0.0	0.094978894765	Absolutely.

0.0	0.662832656196	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.886895057508	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.856676046762	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
1.0	0.216922794626	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.0682516417733	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.106376834714	But the voters are savvier than that.

0.0	0.0687917749705	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.169339076323	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.839831742045	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.106617741285	Thank you.

0.0	0.106796027982	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.0673434973143	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.743424377307	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.00176419081058	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.181662625628	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.126019774987	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
1.0	0.121169330848	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.959179562923	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.856491269083	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.749824569184	We have no borders.
0.0	0.225972164537	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.

0.0	0.110397896901	The other issue is mental health.
1.0	0.975917701633	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
1.0	0.861287255628	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	2.8093394203e-17	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.855908714969	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.

0.0	0.00720041853319	The number of women --
0.0	0.0629394040906	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.9712262253	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.157270159187	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.0829713083659	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
1.0	0.905111343089	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.108414568247	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.890212549425	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
1.0	0.177797851086	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.070919077588	That is...
0.0	0.0617840631741	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.125241649534	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.126412012028	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.

0.0	0.179529256721	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.103387756935	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.

0.0	0.156737884436	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.107769432387	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.710316612929	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.062350006376	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.0582322145014	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.814049196546	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.943209364435	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.197671001128	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.101799591575	You get together.
0.0	0.000789971381518	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.

0.0	0.136530807714	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.281686911325	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.

0.0	0.356539955196	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.0572581322581	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.00176419081058	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.00176419081058	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.420801318772	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.

0.0	0.110001492091	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.020462131679	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.0900928735632	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.497504354356	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.823518022935	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.0722049607302	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.0614902676161	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.713239818764	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.827317514582	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.0742751942061	So I'm going to keep making that case.

0.0	0.141329962151	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.775383368444	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.865392006624	You're simply not.
0.0	0.17361103674	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.166012602823	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.0906725203859	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.11235227562	John?

0.0	0.0630167118532	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.241846793159	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.0856472526293	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.300483975527	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.743237136548	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.834523676975	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.537473956136	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.

0.0	0.0906699298409	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.

0.0	0.114559331783	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.102517955411	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.155346731365	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.00798687868981	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.

0.0	0.421071493566	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.154461318274	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.324452332804	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.0120978301039	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.0550968305831	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.0711403706177	It's not working.
0.0	0.0828732479241	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.118057519262	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.0603895251331	Again...
0.0	0.704943528141	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.0943306010575	OK.
0.0	0.724458799369	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.16615973438	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.113968273712	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.760836745008	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.00494096620213	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.0731605745392	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.736091990224	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.0791843471445	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.861894557266	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.00184966966997	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.851491449634	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.00176419081058	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.0791322783098	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.167071523965	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.84644730905	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.823671319109	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.897532369192	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.853956624034	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.773863037081	This is 2016.
0.0	0.00176419081058	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.00176419081058	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.720318039706	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.196615718724	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.0818207974001	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.00176419081058	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.119195552331	That's not true.
0.0	0.108915240624	Creativity.
0.0	0.103588155088	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.947441120983	We put in place child care support.
1.0	0.770736570048	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.902054290229	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.00176419081058	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	3.33242206378e-23	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.0629427943792	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.102671254524	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.172896880254	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.0925964534701	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.86346316176	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.0123058319439	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.868945009629	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.154925311416	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.0603895251331	So...
0.0	0.880955106428	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.105295563681	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.10331467482	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.792642561125	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.113088225793	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.0565736930284	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.792276024069	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.902754286789	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.116641110098	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.00358045868335	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
1.0	0.96136672547	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.113994421806	Well, I did.
0.0	0.093082241531	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.055417808439	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.117136781479	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.829575164936	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.102052189603	Check it out.
0.0	0.0994869398436	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.282700042893	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.219882318374	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.137047276368	No, you did.
0.0	0.00176419081058	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.860183600836	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.129656464092	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.760100443311	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.0224996818165	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.288796434287	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
1.0	0.746881470107	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.953044943061	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.0942374705013	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.091617074296	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.00176419081058	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.117315828294	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.127608019598	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.755924178464	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
1.0	0.898430359558	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.16407518078	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.112963730702	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.186554760228	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.092267683446	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.113910345013	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.89871060556	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.960824110009	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.107672260504	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.0969343406549	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.0922433669343	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.0701976662854	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.800766670871	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.406696279767	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.156270932401	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.807286646241	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.0755429051356	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.0979458945676	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.104907942009	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
1.0	0.157009912493	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.121179952519	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.130520179139	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.215351940549	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.0906103528392	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.0827366734537	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.00176419081058	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.0616146012128	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.87529670187	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.112982146767	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.106274783938	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.134212225332	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.868208008853	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.947627073518	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.190223439763	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.103296572669	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.159287171235	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.0180830720772	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.0818558626874	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.0864656183596	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.0988733439483	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.0753214405584	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.178354610743	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.00188151672211	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.0822749859845	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.000674684062008	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.158802596111	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.1327791037	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.0683196661994	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	4.59024962101e-05	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.13344788324	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.874504769575	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.135330361329	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.00176419081058	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.80247003444	You know why three?
0.0	0.914790255302	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.100372025854	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.228754351656	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.111955470624	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.68407652072	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.0854865980971	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.128654337467	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.900432479094	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.801240025295	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.869058568853	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.810964506226	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.894701515198	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0852084629107	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.0852833882223	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.879905065763	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.728283073407	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.504740052903	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.0867442115495	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.000261115372613	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.0627235794034	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.0680970338583	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.0602688191959	But...
0.0	0.858180461969	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.0864211557798	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.735037369042	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.101699271061	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.77092134737	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.0652818580149	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.146866094327	You have to lead.
0.0	0.883876677844	That never works.
0.0	0.0722622017841	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.0790169366666	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.814578672737	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.156631965921	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.094153361821	Say again?
0.0	0.0108349666642	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.106617741285	Thank you.
0.0	0.104064206923	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	6.02371792306e-33	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.284004283068	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.735052444901	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.0183475821301	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.109757997452	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.869558447844	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.855176161902	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	2.64193963533e-26	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.911636229197	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.0883429877348	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.0960458606078	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.120936094299	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.108234344741	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.00176419081058	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.894262091747	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.314508483961	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.0892398203584	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.113818128067	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.757690542573	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.156612871546	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.713745431859	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.20043551299	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.782455505272	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.946904911542	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.835601826559	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.100461456308	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.108762581607	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.931643108585	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.753198916444	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.0823990132778	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.0772807122241	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.105698787339	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.108611398143	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.091931703005	Our next president...
0.0	0.0796602853802	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.821595661984	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.114782240697	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.194034323138	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.834254833992	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.114684034291	No.
0.0	0.103581333856	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.232393234978	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.79826226083	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.105606804496	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.175853948095	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.888849608301	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.247605387119	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.172817578668	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.14138690165	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.118243773135	You looking at me?
0.0	0.0962503016348	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.155692656259	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.0709256714437	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.166735430461	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.747206316358	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.092325022882	Can we stop?
0.0	0.11004608823	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.119123868979	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.136246739919	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.114684034291	No.
0.0	0.0852502352954	You know why?
0.0	0.0559491522243	...
0.0	0.0974956726449	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.0956894666896	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.101320543297	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.0707271728466	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.112702751222	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.880965317008	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.125965939196	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.173305174963	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.816776633284	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.12600247572	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.0855855647668	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.948307826533	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.843692576797	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.00686120976582	Not keeping the government open.
1.0	0.825682334097	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.838615768795	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.0902452083839	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.880553506582	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.106932367894	We are not France.
0.0	0.138766562513	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.288451122024	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.970928806653	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.0958859162642	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.00260628360079	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.213383392143	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	1.54540259343e-29	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.798134715908	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.0542396712329	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.107655156696	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.00155890910281	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.787258464877	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.161608168862	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.747522826119	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.737985086616	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.00176419081058	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.808127762024	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.0605136325407	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.139010920049	That's my bill.
0.0	3.4222373069e-13	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.0684780920529	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.816525214147	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.103582344105	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.15312919368	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.161030177903	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.104722234061	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.0671640735859	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.808336623406	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.823092814034	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.0363865373319	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.0631852489112	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.843520685443	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.923315051362	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.076575210878	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.0617891431525	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.206486221078	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
1.0	0.142818664426	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.0685873257132	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.947055502338	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.793464321356	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.169344007806	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.728759312414	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.107002809953	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.101506866831	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.0554272424734	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.0229796550107	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.0926397415487	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.273238791128	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.0625207947447	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.00176419081058	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.0926794669729	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.082836522776	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.873993669122	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.904943069332	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.791972746608	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.0887615109982	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.148680982631	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.0808219822072	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.0555660089299	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.111328232542	My background is different.
0.0	0.107867096657	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.77142889039	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.0840199537175	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.158051525564	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.795126287501	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	9.66696418558e-10	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.107829623016	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.0774221279812	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.114639535333	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.787112892496	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.112760121351	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.196406237707	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.927188020492	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.156426033657	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.301983353625	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.763358198677	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.685823662751	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.102552135148	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.92577533914	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.217489121545	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.0635216569151	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.101988878987	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	3.37288255708e-08	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.139098160192	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.00176419081058	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	2.85876180721e-21	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.166842367699	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.1159505673	I promise.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.148542072522	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.179462794943	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.209848249564	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.0997392211275	I love this country.
0.0	0.816682702227	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.797305587294	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.846321588375	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.0698252285205	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.769133213379	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.14293060868	That is important.
0.0	0.867560151506	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.224032787768	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.172943805491	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	4.71119578662e-07	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.145147042502	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.106645897075	You bet they do.
0.0	0.116934403486	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.107200829626	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.805039350359	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.115738247891	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.0171387853377	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.0915267274104	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.104567944457	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.00303349519338	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
1.0	0.88185528725	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.0985682018731	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.729341265929	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.736963890711	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.108493517117	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.77952394808	He has never defended...
1.0	0.415955783635	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.0979963026226	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	2.34719512003e-17	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.90607897048	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.174819991646	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.0792808074019	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.101234900136	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.0160480886774	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
1.0	0.97972128201	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.0912723036262	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.920540280297	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.0814405310975	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.787275006567	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.141436904937	And you know what?
0.0	0.104281789494	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.141041151097	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.964877334999	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.0893537054024	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.173303098588	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.818078862299	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.0829248834379	I would just say that...
0.0	0.864473977784	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.0808976325817	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.867630893221	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.0995676032724	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.917045518501	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.105917824894	I'll say this.
0.0	0.094069844503	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.733214430163	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.830467399332	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.908269164079	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.0598259346053	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.123766327966	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.102890052372	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.812457720246	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.110532316597	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.0943306010575	Yes.
0.0	0.12867196438	White people?
0.0	0.148925277232	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.0989933023387	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.950102381097	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	3.1360904538e-23	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.160066257343	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.960253462041	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.761937834832	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.0932402175317	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.792692637391	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.652726635449	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.00183082941757	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.178171790283	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.103608567784	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.650983002493	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.109581206876	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.165303528566	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.841446989039	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.647689471857	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.157412107142	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.83180372036	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.191336966252	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.831925079081	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.810923882378	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.60118653255	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.810289541971	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.879608354239	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.00294737608119	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.86844907523	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.943365184949	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.902484333276	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.00176419081058	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.000309880681635	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.914668549666	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.06969591128	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.180161995207	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.100515581638	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.0948242576733	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.0745317169321	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.705444754444	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.116784284698	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.128993673183	I want security.
0.0	0.156632471626	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.00176419081058	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.699214036365	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.153177555618	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.817458490031	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.18824523007	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.775545770443	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.861401473723	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.0955088216176	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.0137832945901	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.0297186540091	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
1.0	1.08807519622e-32	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.162283334726	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.114728063153	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.073324286358	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.895564342307	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	3.25738183605e-11	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.069449195231	You find me...
0.0	0.0660112661164	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.24108663052	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.770988129375	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
1.0	1.86767037589e-26	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.00176419081058	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.121948047502	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.777848751115	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.849399771768	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.438161356357	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.155724060817	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
1.0	0.672986371155	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.109891594796	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
1.0	0.769839098103	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.0824562783183	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.128804159266	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.00176419081058	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.0584196463323	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.0687900756663	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.155276615944	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.000360582971696	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.0943306010575	Yes.
0.0	0.0999480032524	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.756045258551	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.0814283764435	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
1.0	0.0835950296626	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.0126201477959	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.110434605653	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.0714975005417	Do we still have values and principles?
1.0	0.777129181718	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.11389878074	I can do that.
0.0	0.0669737897709	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.816889351434	They're a scam.
0.0	0.777177641568	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.924510137636	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.0828784477369	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.0841338806639	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.0835372672303	How do I know this?
0.0	0.0661166820348	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.0853955602575	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.361120806608	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.0820687909765	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.959439318852	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.0719388025757	Maria...
0.0	0.892114923571	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.10663200568	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.385641084718	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.00176419081058	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.0851082674278	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.840447118577	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.0588317754192	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.104845143358	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.707445180709	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.191060932385	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.106411901308	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.0922516372896	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.00176419081058	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.156996451221	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.265060781393	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
1.0	0.956774656927	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.0999835107289	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.0872720387115	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.904477253252	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.656874324129	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0896019260693	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.101799591575	We haven't.
0.0	0.0752685469791	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.139497780708	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.00398608703504	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.111079744256	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.984078986021	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.908338694781	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.397811082996	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.110434656767	And God bless America.
0.0	0.892116229997	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.822473461475	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.10506843501	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.863263595357	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.926727256326	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.150807468857	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.00404334967822	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.917882396859	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.107272831244	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.15807456011	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.172532952403	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.214757512527	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.00176419081058	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.903836402885	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.10294476999	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.10127612263	That's what we need.
0.0	0.0927543826209	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.716472400219	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.0943306010575	Yes.
0.0	0.835324781001	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.825240753119	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.760734698887	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.133358078242	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.0884450189089	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.0928747836749	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.0988600489975	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.1953037074	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.00178514059775	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...

0.0	0.110212325311	And here's what the economic issue is.

0.0	0.123865999498	We are lowering taxes on small business.

0.0	0.112810976547	I like it.

0.0	0.115167114546	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.0982771413815	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.955970917901	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.217315290087	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?

0.0	0.0738481043766	Why?
0.0	0.227962297984	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.530166947858	That's not right.
0.0	0.0934228464966	I think that's a mistake.

0.0	0.110413475795	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.906069776893	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.845512787939	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.857349447997	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.834784266618	Just ditto to that.

0.0	0.838284651353	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.

0.0	0.0055699107156	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.0756304654355	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.835721760203	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.0641472872081	...No, sir...

0.0	0.285197067344	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.00176419081058	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.836033834945	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.252998458488	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.104226123391	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.1395508021	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.112041207077	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.0949101010939	We actually did it.
0.0	0.0940139598223	I will not do that.
0.0	0.858829101923	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.220422275011	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.915489164418	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.0697271513967	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.

0.0	0.123113067415	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.795327587461	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.00176419081058	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.675200814088	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.74838842972	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.125039695241	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.915244297426	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.855536133525	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.0856905266865	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.

0.0	0.171483714909	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.728713154855	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.167042092906	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.

0.0	0.802087979962	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.895654213091	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.

0.0	0.749712539491	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.164607026997	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.914791123561	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.967168931964	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.108790551489	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.113375313549	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.841223933485	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.88536586555	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.100349062781	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.101336909684	Wait for what?
0.0	0.0742599124613	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.106617741285	Thank you.
0.0	0.759203788866	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.0735012717685	These...
0.0	0.753557195187	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.18613289192	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.108356794484	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.109507762961	...before I go.
0.0	0.814134775387	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.146069809666	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.854419297446	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.152164829491	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.0872892454788	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	3.65780363761e-27	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.874071194377	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.133148791064	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.143223201272	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.232311040412	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.751195872352	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.881349780417	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.125968566328	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.0872901404276	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.0044208633285	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.951242884603	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.00176419081058	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.0605844258159	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.786235359691	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.0949325513379	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
1.0	0.247906269822	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.215676372653	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.363543771097	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.0740287376694	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.846473313307	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.0559491522243	...
0.0	0.891634993567	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.834443458667	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.00290237294566	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.822123305901	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.785232475108	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.11791712182	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.0559491522243	...
0.0	0.100989877283	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.681604534501	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.0693316769672	But look...
0.0	0.0858426113968	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.899599566953	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.117357343599	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.0749322151203	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.885732530776	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.0605731784188	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.00176419081058	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.397478182146	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.833289034163	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.189894605143	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.0911397033045	We can't do it.
0.0	0.141175521732	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.104039638076	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.775227710272	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.0729692261851	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.0646116306654	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.0989701709831	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.201145261474	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.77203079471	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.170726518106	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.2147203416	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.0943306010575	OK.
0.0	0.138050642017	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.25610188476	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.772486565414	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.762772577345	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.121457681992	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.170651973238	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.123576253859	They're absolutely false.
0.0	2.43423809005e-09	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.135926458104	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.114564600714	I have.
0.0	0.812476123064	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.921981791535	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.0772082630923	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.901617987133	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.116235174474	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.107220065315	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.833907652414	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.808837787598	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.141436904937	And you know what?
0.0	0.062880198821	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.680584162119	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.0705792962966	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.0814099761402	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.904200424567	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.693631872272	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.568594349593	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.70082729255	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.763911196975	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.0907925065863	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.118683542882	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.181080469732	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.135917850496	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.146066690246	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.960712352414	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.909198127718	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.101605423581	He does great.
0.0	0.226107363514	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.810474038282	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.0215075867278	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.815584069174	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.118374837973	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.0970297774504	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.00176419081058	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.056525600723	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.133292606277	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.138430314222	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.00176419081058	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.729872760862	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.0744517788254	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.882146021066	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.829857424864	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.0754535478693	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.155362619304	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.0849346460234	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.133159785005	Big difference.
0.0	0.0752414463924	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.138791773583	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.0890937076963	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.709486644465	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.12002103571	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.105992248257	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.000192716369947	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.106018349303	We don't need that.
0.0	0.873908230661	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.0954018368077	That's for sure.
0.0	0.175870935209	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.128776435859	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.530166947858	That's not right.
0.0	0.886717859421	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.903577504684	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.100942425474	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.83320176756	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.886984534812	That is our government today.
0.0	0.0573823921976	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.102123440654	She said the truth.
0.0	0.81575370037	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.143259973354	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.885017766226	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.0756427894832	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.141571122926	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.771126349148	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.184100433184	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.103895678851	It is.
0.0	0.212372778936	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.128839017517	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.122510868258	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.000106287028571	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.123486035455	We have people out of work.
1.0	0.962893579917	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.945217731902	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.0735112496809	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.892644935255	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.0797656972868	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.0609599703812	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.103678562901	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.0673381363581	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.0095467826661	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.119842886033	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.840293282605	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.1886898615	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.793262810296	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.906131159428	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.0989546041228	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.713576274838	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.0794706935934	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.164595533285	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.0971510224	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.00176419081058	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.124084798105	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.736976284453	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.00077531642589	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.172969218584	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.778598542997	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.0762943184483	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.106617741285	Thank you.
0.0	0.14205544516	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.895864114255	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.104402820361	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.844798898414	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.0959304689696	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.729596132643	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.716152958629	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.00176419081058	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.822796216998	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.0766439070129	Came out great.
0.0	0.165327371574	And in fact I would go further.
