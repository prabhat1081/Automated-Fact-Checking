0.0	1.07257834186e-15	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	1.5468765956e-64	He's wrong.

0.0	0.130859432034	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.882051070223	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.863904669304	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.130859432034	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	1.32128797347e-30	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.130859432034	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.898349417976	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	7.2547088103e-56	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	8.64339964006e-29	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	4.88324674556e-23	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.951018265661	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.130859432034	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.999985427206	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	6.50745251444e-62	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.130859432034	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	4.93084312746e-09	You target the bad guys.
0.0	5.89950076793e-34	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.130859432034	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	4.16248258179e-24	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.130859432034	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	1.09262867248e-11	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.999999995584	I changed that.
0.0	5.90573369023e-41	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.130859432034	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.939670652512	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.781150106743	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	2.25451746746e-55	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.130859432034	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.999353666642	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.329593199401	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.921965715062	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.130859432034	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	1.82831159015e-20	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
1.0	0.130859432034	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	2.56632940309e-17	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.790220880389	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.130859432034	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	9.97876287703e-33	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	1.41329816943e-61	OK, good.
0.0	4.80724957662e-07	That's fine.
0.0	3.0621669605e-23	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	7.64525115374e-10	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	7.64811483135e-41	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	7.19566758591e-05	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.946686608738	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.832053386072	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.999992897559	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	3.11603706986e-25	That is what I believe.
0.0	1.18984792755e-09	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.130859432034	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	1.46268709073e-12	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	1.04833422843e-32	Right.
0.0	0.130859432034	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	2.56876868568e-30	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.130859432034	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.926802610684	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	3.88476591892e-22	And so do I.
0.0	0.909487573773	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're running.
0.0	0.957435007342	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.84794797467	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.864392847729	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	1.43690723491e-15	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.130859432034	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.694631530045	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.999994040148	Of course, they would.
0.0	1.73160172715e-12	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	1.0	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.130859432034	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.130859432034	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	6.28531483577e-36	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
1.0	0.999066976156	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.934501829121	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	3.50652481838e-19	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	1.21700464026e-21	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.999999999815	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.0861576425584	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.866496707275	They were paid speeches.
0.0	9.89563985491e-11	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.949658213686	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	8.40710068456e-26	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.130859432034	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.130859432034	And who can blame them?
0.0	9.25147172243e-37	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	2.12840922537e-29	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	1.0	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.130859432034	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.130859432034	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.130859432034	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.911108604529	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0463122063253	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.000285805158061	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.00037928058631	We have no borders.
0.0	0.130859432034	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.130859432034	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.999999982513	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.999997648639	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.999999658877	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.130859432034	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.130859432034	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	1.85756224697e-10	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	5.40515792675e-07	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.999965405524	I was the architect.
0.0	0.0456705058528	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	1.6478808168e-31	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
1.0	0.937311704413	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	5.65613667187e-67	...
0.0	1.33237632403e-09	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.99999999657	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	4.75292182174e-30	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
1.0	0.937365114122	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	1.27657226831e-37	Thank you.
0.0	0.971640069832	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	1.55184049191e-27	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.130859432034	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	9.02642734254e-36	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.320857923868	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.903569484537	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.0984621441382	I've done it.
0.0	0.489937401262	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.130859432034	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.130859432034	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.999999890544	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.130859432034	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.130859432034	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.900972254194	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.99997253397	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	1.3855132951e-32	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	1.07501777048e-16	I think you're --
0.0	1.04833422843e-32	Right.
0.0	0.944110050037	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	7.48377073771e-27	Well, I've been --
0.0	1.54136126583e-16	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	8.35072180348e-14	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	7.13458572105e-30	I love this country.
0.0	0.380433195861	You get together.
0.0	0.620919423095	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	2.9666825758e-19	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.130859432034	You don't have to.
0.0	9.37315917167e-13	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.394519652954	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.130859432034	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.946391254151	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.859204173505	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.130859432034	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.

0.0	0.130859432034	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	2.6918878265e-43	That is what I could do for the country.

0.0	0.00147454178637	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.653464780344	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.999997141245	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	1.45455981623e-15	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
1.0	0.341983247741	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.

0.0	2.66649594635e-15	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.130859432034	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
1.0	0.698740201397	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.130859432034	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.

0.0	0.130859432034	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.130859432034	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.

0.0	0.130859432034	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	5.17559824704e-46	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	3.97942986138e-29	Think about it.
0.0	1.00405670591e-18	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	1.27657226831e-37	Thank you.
0.0	0.99883821595	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	2.88595400727e-31	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	4.19131716296e-05	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.130859432034	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	7.6407582394e-15	Do I take the product?

0.0	0.130859432034	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.999174348981	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.130859432034	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	8.9288370305e-11	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.997628612063	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.130859432034	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.130859432034	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	1.67870226868e-11	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	7.62759038311e-13	You are working at McDonald's?
1.0	0.804346906764	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.130859432034	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.999998837673	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	1.53061732106e-16	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.130859432034	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.130859432034	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	1.9188794468e-35	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.791514395769	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.999999860461	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.187157904541	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.0319761150505	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	1.70299728431e-16	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	1.0	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.130859432034	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.999999997554	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
1.0	1.08352998202e-29	That's wrong.
0.0	9.03095620771e-32	That never works.
0.0	4.34820972262e-06	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	2.37596511266e-21	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	1.62731783245e-36	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.939699824612	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	3.79242943058e-41	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.999999999996	That's what I said.
0.0	0.904783651284	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.0104159698512	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.367842959923	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	3.06438037541e-30	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.130859432034	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	9.98017110184e-30	Let the states do this.
0.0	1.9255270722e-37	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.821922744088	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.999999998845	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.130859432034	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.130859432034	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	7.21028786204e-23	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.998523266831	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.130859432034	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.130859432034	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.130859432034	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	5.34182262145e-20	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.999838370278	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.383161380772	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.130859432034	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.999999999905	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.130859432034	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.999565380667	I got that.
1.0	0.993670331371	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	8.47553509034e-18	Creativity.
0.0	0.892694470306	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	4.55387219149e-13	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.130859432034	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.130859432034	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	3.96119035625e-14	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	1.50823132635e-114	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	3.91836762353e-26	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.996344441726	The world has changed.
0.0	0.817576237147	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.130859432034	You can't have a question.
0.0	4.16601361917e-08	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.901278182685	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	1.16535219354e-18	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.999999962349	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.999642248187	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.999999975203	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.130859432034	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.130859432034	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	1.0	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.977284345466	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
1.0	0.926538248268	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.130859432034	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.130859432034	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.489700233795	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.999999970359	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.999371102784	Both served.
0.0	1.50324150346e-18	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	2.33456010243e-32	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.130859432034	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.870800734252	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	7.47178572964e-30	We need sound money.
0.0	0.955812822888	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.99996121902	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.923027909932	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	1.0	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.993583991528	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.130859432034	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.

0.0	0.949209090769	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.999999999987	I didn't.

0.0	0.0263381225292	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.130859432034	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.

0.0	6.11325144427e-71	Again...
0.0	0.130859432034	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	6.79457966028e-26	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	1.66353723569e-44	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.99999997151	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.842059107976	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.999999977259	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.877211360997	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.999840863495	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.93060961464	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.999999889929	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	1.48096697523e-28	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	5.19717214826e-10	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.999999989541	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	4.71932345372e-47	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.99987245073	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.759718267347	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.130859432034	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.851317610138	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.130859432034	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.912769205274	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.716508169586	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.130859432034	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	1.54409743802e-12	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	1.01693933543e-07	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	2.11429655505e-08	The guns don't pull the trigger.
1.0	0.94144994211	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.000571575268981	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.130859432034	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	1.0	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.130859432034	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	4.42607813692e-13	Not bad.
0.0	0.130859432034	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.130859432034	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	2.83328467561e-12	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.130859432034	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.130859432034	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.893995323146	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.999999999999	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	3.71097093903e-10	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.130859432034	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.130859432034	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	2.18033558746e-13	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	1.87493966555e-20	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.130859432034	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.999999935536	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	9.78640039922e-13	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.000282696893563	The most mistreated people.
0.0	2.2414392211e-21	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.999507047971	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	2.83116198692e-25	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.130859432034	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.130859432034	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.00834578133409	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
1.0	0.130859432034	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.876314162526	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.130859432034	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	7.91070995966e-21	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.130859432034	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.130859432034	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.130859432034	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.130859432034	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.95015915733	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.130859432034	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	5.20913639172e-111	No -- no...
0.0	0.584173720529	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	5.31217603774e-19	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.814711450314	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.924589615064	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.130859432034	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.000174022784786	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	5.06410862206e-13	You know that.
0.0	1.04833422843e-32	Right.
0.0	0.942798582834	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.857238676355	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.130859432034	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
1.0	0.130859432034	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	7.27211127525e-23	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	1.04833422843e-32	Ever.
0.0	1.1521008182e-12	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.130859432034	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.130859432034	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.941366614277	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.130859432034	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	1.92933159091e-30	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.93494510702	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.130859432034	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.999999990197	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.878815602285	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.956324618734	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	7.91042765023e-08	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.892725898768	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	1.59841024021e-50	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.130859432034	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.136962670718	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.367509646986	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.130859432034	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.130859432034	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.130859432034	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
1.0	0.95312033898	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.900126922187	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.130859432034	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.999999984168	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.802767520869	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.130859432034	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.93973887939	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	2.13852432037e-18	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.999999999997	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.0110446294296	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.999989922819	They didn't do that.
0.0	4.45677358121e-31	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.999997903229	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.665462159011	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.130859432034	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	5.47539683303e-12	We're friends.
0.0	6.77025525002e-80	But look...
0.0	0.130859432034	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.130859432034	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.130859432034	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.928036018076	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.953629087672	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	5.53597907467e-30	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.798427980717	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.00125127363136	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.130859432034	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.130859432034	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.999987890722	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	3.11262525934e-30	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.130859432034	So you know what?
0.0	0.999995523969	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	2.95468554354e-16	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.819697920966	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.130859432034	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.0661675622816	That's the difference.
0.0	0.632324080499	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	4.57974026206e-16	It's their money.
0.0	0.880410874746	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.974508791472	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.139039601173	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.130859432034	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.897179085425	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	4.89844621291e-13	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	1.27523104698e-23	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.999999817842	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	6.12130405975e-15	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.999998961355	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.940045254489	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	6.58029891674e-20	You get the Senate.
0.0	1.98154470921e-65	I would just say that...
0.0	0.130859432034	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	8.68326151536e-33	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.130859432034	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	7.06847069632e-29	John?
0.0	5.11851490114e-18	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.94047626424	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.787995031619	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.000284812082314	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.130859432034	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.894698860673	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.130859432034	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	6.74269424613e-19	I like it.
0.0	5.52744660134e-59	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	1.1610460429e-40	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	3.71674099169e-07	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.130859432034	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	9.13563727531e-27	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
1.0	0.956328355089	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.441278138058	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	8.24195360359e-36	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	1.64723586762e-28	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.130859432034	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	1.08693459771e-39	See?
0.0	0.999784429523	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.882141237492	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.998233719422	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	1.36503516887e-179	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.130859432034	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.130859432034	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.455114450677	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.948714898305	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	1.22398333841e-39	This is the first priority.
0.0	1.36593536089e-16	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	7.16773941464e-21	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.130859432034	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.130859432034	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.0220550630652	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.00019400949145	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.

0.0	0.130859432034	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.130859432034	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.0204477204696	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.847449811088	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.130859432034	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.

0.0	0.903950284752	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.130859432034	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.

0.0	0.130859432034	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	4.50928032386e-07	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	3.85475788374e-18	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	6.10832474306e-23	Well, I would really appreciate that.

0.0	0.999999851511	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.929815008578	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.99999903785	You know why three?
0.0	0.906836850919	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	1.17136380486e-42	He undermines it.
0.0	0.130859432034	You bet they do.
0.0	0.897476451216	Number one, you have people in this country that...
1.0	0.383265425579	The Oregon study showed this.

0.0	0.845239290209	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.

0.0	0.984424430315	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	3.54513222085e-24	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.878928947442	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
1.0	0.997010301018	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.889219142779	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.130859432034	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	1.01175248342e-05	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	5.29223204267e-39	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.130859432034	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.999993863885	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
1.0	0.890989751172	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.130859432034	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.130859432034	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.130859432034	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	6.50167427073e-39	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	8.3164517354e-33	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.130859432034	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	1.42758630962e-15	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	1.58854681888e-25	Growth is the answer.

0.0	0.933364645462	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.99999999981	We actually did it.
0.0	0.686180883531	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	1.42235358017e-17	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.999999733616	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.999999999812	Check it out.
0.0	0.130859432034	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.130859432034	And you know what?
0.0	0.999997317494	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	1.90438857896e-18	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.830341440611	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.854381765862	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.395245523606	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.999999991375	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.874126884182	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.

0.0	0.130859432034	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.948309608216	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.999999999987	She was right.
0.0	6.79636388424e-37	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.84321500303	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	2.27666830854e-22	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	3.041713248e-48	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.130859432034	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	2.16552759092e-11	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.130859432034	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.

0.0	0.999501212005	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.95108728228	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	9.5663282977e-07	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.

0.0	0.10552205889	That will change everything.
0.0	0.130859432034	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.130859432034	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.

0.0	2.77460415927e-13	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.999990367753	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.130859432034	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.

0.0	0.130859432034	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.985722630085	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.

0.0	0.130859432034	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
1.0	0.999999999864	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.890465379165	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	2.19442099012e-24	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.999999999994	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.869928109134	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.999999123502	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.22346788087	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	3.65128634831e-28	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.130859432034	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	2.81105291114e-23	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	1.42259338689e-18	They don't like that.
0.0	0.130859432034	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	2.75994267359e-34	Why didn't they call?
1.0	0.902033240377	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	7.06847069632e-29	Alright.
0.0	1.95797754726e-35	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	3.6886802185e-69	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.130859432034	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	2.87668034404e-20	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	1.87189274228e-28	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.130859432034	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	8.32372616968e-18	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	1.4796163592e-47	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.130859432034	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	2.37970094382e-08	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	3.24863041539e-13	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.99947078595	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.0551653130932	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	2.7707863287e-28	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	1.64757217049e-34	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	9.58259480765e-09	They're a scam.
0.0	3.00311210866e-40	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.948237651359	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	2.14346921035e-24	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.343712961337	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	3.60340694915e-17	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	1.09583370922e-10	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.130859432034	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.999997905752	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	2.64458467451e-23	That's my view.
0.0	0.798571195383	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.130859432034	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.130859432034	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.945752388192	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.130859432034	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.130859432034	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.839893637606	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.130859432034	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	1.44795919578e-39	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	1.37721145799e-18	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.884899574922	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.130859432034	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	1.0978223869e-77	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	6.57940374415e-15	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.130859432034	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.130859432034	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.938167659018	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.308322061043	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	8.0139192434e-16	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.999999999999	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.876657235554	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.252354381029	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.130859432034	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	1.79078744877e-29	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	3.82008821405e-16	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.999999940104	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.899971487247	Our rights come from God.
0.0	7.43100100482e-17	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.476800614154	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
1.0	0.757453302333	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.130859432034	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
1.0	0.957538894473	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.955924842106	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.130859432034	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	1.15637353436e-68	Why is that?
0.0	1.4860486225e-28	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	1.65347994122e-62	And why?
0.0	0.130859432034	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	2.10544004169e-13	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	6.80116594595e-40	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.997605617175	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.354465476189	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.928970377663	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	7.02605109203e-25	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.999999892389	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.130859432034	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.856923423608	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	7.05324877689e-50	It goes away.
0.0	7.56865043337e-36	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	3.06495620479e-30	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.948394281211	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.919977988384	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.999439558765	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.130859432034	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	6.25958742419e-12	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.999999999956	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.75867134638	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	3.32075767186e-25	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	1.36185585373e-07	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.257509149313	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.130859432034	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.481554462474	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	1.35517309821e-67	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	3.71620552515e-15	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.99999831149	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.130859432034	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.999999999999	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.130859432034	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.900478628489	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.999937489775	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.999998976131	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.677711241879	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.999993781662	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.999999880836	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	1.39322183803e-11	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.999776800754	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	1.0	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.852787000664	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.99999965958	Well, the deal was done.
1.0	0.634052439335	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	1.1337587868e-26	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	1.17834328601e-13	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	1.49205702933e-12	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.130859432034	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.380433195861	We haven't.
0.0	0.130859432034	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.130859432034	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.892265099836	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	4.91703332735e-13	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.130859432034	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	4.66138357105e-59	That's what he is.
0.0	0.960789727277	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.722325747074	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.130859432034	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.997244595037	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
1.0	0.925157783216	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.0382605745832	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.9999999863	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.130859432034	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	2.77130903317e-10	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.742749403597	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
1.0	0.130859432034	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	4.17860898911e-86	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.999982372834	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.89968975125	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	2.21157618175e-72	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.999952248122	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	7.87072137889e-20	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	1.09723338029e-12	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	2.74986268094e-05	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.130859432034	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.130859432034	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.999997301337	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.122522655447	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.000589930024419	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.999960245503	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.130859432034	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.130859432034	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.956325279965	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	5.25256921797e-29	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	5.14556945973e-19	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.294565272779	Two quick responses.
1.0	0.781857403602	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.996883138987	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.823142995632	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	2.64613738879e-10	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.130859432034	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.684222809818	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.130859432034	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.742244943098	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	2.01650075308e-08	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.757213966977	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	9.53577195652e-18	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.918448961054	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.831541283981	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	5.86315240642e-12	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	1.44643822766e-14	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	1.74425442508e-36	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.130859432034	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.46777174263	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.130859432034	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	2.75611078489e-08	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
1.0	0.899421415609	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.527766450114	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.130859432034	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.99999903785	You know why three?
0.0	0.996573557611	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.999998984828	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.998938259735	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.833614962918	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.130859432034	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	3.30733749221e-53	OK.
0.0	7.11710060394e-45	I would change them.
0.0	1.83394379642e-08	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.130859432034	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	7.8028682095e-10	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.999999961904	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.999992690415	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	8.48101574364e-55	The answer is simple.
0.0	3.14549645777e-16	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.130859432034	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.952912663883	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	2.03465960878e-09	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.999999978151	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.130859432034	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	3.55566929807e-12	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.994194474869	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.99999989632	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.902559498224	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.130859432034	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	4.88398245013e-13	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.99999987419	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	1.45510861984e-25	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.950792763891	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	5.55310822778e-39	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.69507355151	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.999997446619	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	2.85221681941e-12	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	1.79439947027e-17	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.999996562721	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	3.91956224732e-43	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	1.12339618229e-60	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	7.64177399291e-36	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	8.54819231791e-28	I don't care.
0.0	0.827255374552	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.893160308849	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.38673960653	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.130859432034	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	1.06996365074e-09	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.99996847113	She voted for it.
0.0	0.999836128047	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.108977271913	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.130859432034	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.130859432034	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.130859432034	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	1.90473643939e-38	How great is that?
0.0	1.56624856603e-22	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	3.38754590068e-17	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.907624187716	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.130859432034	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.130859432034	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	4.5647691989e-50	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.948545255029	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	1.66695477577e-23	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.999999989613	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	2.01794699532e-21	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.909307303975	Two points.
0.0	0.860433510205	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	1.18152452463e-74	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	6.03494076763e-19	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.130859432034	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	1.17213397966e-13	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.998234259231	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.384460555848	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	8.80786393648e-20	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	2.29293849351e-30	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.939582643113	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	5.81470209626e-23	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.943133096145	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	5.86908668787e-14	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.130859432034	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.731020380361	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	1.45275882225e-13	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.999963081033	We're not doing it.
0.0	8.6109364087e-23	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	1.55540617174e-16	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.130859432034	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.130859432034	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.130859432034	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.999999814041	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.948831657117	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.932727935131	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	3.57014761907e-20	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.999989637393	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.48920942428	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.0007637416596	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.932460632166	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.130859432034	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	3.76274022473e-17	No vision at all.
0.0	0.130859432034	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	9.26804722173e-25	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.665902444292	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	8.80516481091e-41	A rich person does not.
0.0	2.00737842356e-20	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	1.44318488229e-21	I understand.
0.0	8.18854225485e-29	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	1.0435957188e-18	I love China.
0.0	0.130859432034	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	3.37230775701e-19	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	1.53186626511e-53	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.901290631812	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.00965512150881	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	1.24609478487e-35	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
1.0	0.8271453578	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	4.62675842907e-16	In all due respect...
0.0	0.130859432034	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.130859432034	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.877620810887	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	1.1189568308e-18	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.99935304187	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.130859432034	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	7.48911745917e-09	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	6.49929205631e-28	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	1.58051105737e-14	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	7.55219061316e-20	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
1.0	0.853758557621	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	5.05609370914e-35	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	1.91474969673e-35	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.952042375785	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.960901007643	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	7.43060011315e-60	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.130859432034	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.999683974978	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.130859432034	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.999999852656	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	1.88546567348e-16	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.949015815782	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.895424276061	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.991049039085	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.530973245394	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	1.03573962975e-36	That is not right.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	2.54155142653e-07	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.810194608111	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.291620087202	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	5.0227110761e-20	Our next president...
0.0	0.130859432034	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	2.09625626213e-42	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	1.0	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.453487881001	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	1.03573962975e-36	That's not right.
0.0	0.902038449445	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.130859432034	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	8.88686732405e-23	You get the Congress.
0.0	1.89443693347e-19	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.130859432034	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	5.47237677585e-26	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	2.89373567523e-18	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	1.49992686609e-17	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.999960985719	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.999999999959	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.130859432034	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	1.00604592974e-89	These...
0.0	0.999375857806	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.0989171146358	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	6.73847788907e-19	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.130859432034	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.999966333905	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	1.83378059142e-10	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.130859432034	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.999999035178	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.558625661868	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.130859432034	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.0625886505991	They go to Princeton.
0.0	3.47785533675e-13	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.999999675676	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.850554493959	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	7.62365639543e-07	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	4.62844135854e-12	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.130859432034	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.130859432034	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	7.1652676959e-17	And, we said no.
0.0	8.28296417108e-20	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.904003045574	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	6.21913769928e-31	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	1.31653398038e-13	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	1.0	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	3.25896363319e-14	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.00201488702335	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	1.27909613159e-71	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	1.42871077977e-16	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	3.80868112128e-24	I have.
0.0	0.130859432034	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	6.85433961357e-10	I think we should do both.
0.0	6.13035181506e-17	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.130859432034	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.130859432034	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.999999999961	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	1.69394264338e-17	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.130859432034	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	9.62910520238e-15	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.999911685138	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.130859432034	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.995453690462	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.130859432034	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.903909250722	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	2.29774599954e-15	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.999843932523	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.999998093083	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.99999950484	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	1.7701223832e-31	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.999998496185	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.913138988666	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.737427650568	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.0406830466189	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	1.30673105517e-11	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.902598308757	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	2.81310263607e-31	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.130859432034	Good at email.
0.0	6.59347616724e-07	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	1.09625291964e-64	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	1.29322372963e-42	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.000306573942329	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	1.51512599069e-22	We have Arab allies.
0.0	3.25356800115e-10	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	5.16490460955e-15	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.899557813906	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	5.69618772965e-35	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.911605191181	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.929396885589	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.130859432034	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.953596225471	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	9.48587933572e-06	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.130859432034	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.

0.0	0.428712298806	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.99991426962	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.130859432034	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.130859432034	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.130859432034	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	3.65811639068e-14	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.99999985664	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.

0.0	0.932248687684	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	1.27657226831e-37	Thank you.
0.0	8.37727656856e-10	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.999996562721	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.130859432034	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.130859432034	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.0533159585931	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.130859432034	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.

0.0	4.59681142979e-17	I think he is right.
0.0	6.31112492334e-36	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.130859432034	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.999992431873	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
1.0	0.130859432034	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	2.08906092632e-12	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.999944900969	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.872792524175	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.943672823663	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.727269678473	They pay tax once overseas.

0.0	0.130859432034	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.948319626755	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
1.0	0.130859432034	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.130859432034	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.999647386135	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.931528919425	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.130859432034	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.130859432034	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.130859432034	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.999999977775	I have no idea.
0.0	4.99519658198e-11	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.130859432034	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.99999487881	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.948089859655	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	3.63666319949e-19	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.130859432034	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.816637452043	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
1.0	0.130859432034	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	7.05250769309e-26	No, it's true.
0.0	0.996949681979	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.130859432034	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	1.6808810497e-09	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.786119388244	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	4.18539891441e-16	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.9805019051	I was not that candidate.
1.0	0.900855979614	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	1.48799587753e-25	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.130859432034	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.843992581707	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.130859432034	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	1.27657226831e-37	Thank you.
0.0	0.836120891413	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.779714501042	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.000421105995922	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.00317515061327	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.0990471758786	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.997076205036	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.917580693364	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	1.65802908333e-72	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.466581648927	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.941441089832	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.748686744167	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.90263768377	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.601611195416	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.999999330545	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	1.34970197984e-10	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.760883474046	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	5.81369819093e-14	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.998611564904	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.891642724542	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	1.29302176175e-23	I can do that.
0.0	0.130859432034	They're off to China.
0.0	0.993113937787	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.999925452172	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.000334659482448	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	7.05324877689e-50	It never happens.
0.0	5.64869674137e-13	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.130859432034	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.681554621406	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	4.8371657666e-46	And guess what?
0.0	0.999999994554	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.130859432034	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	1.66379327906e-43	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	3.46951618285e-18	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.899418636157	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.999999999904	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	1.63327828284e-20	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	6.71704902519e-32	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.999282643147	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.812469737185	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.130859432034	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	1.83800956945e-28	No.
0.0	5.89981136564e-50	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.941014733823	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	1.0	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.144790914138	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.99999975962	I've got a track record.
0.0	4.49238452392e-21	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	7.21092414735e-15	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	4.41394099085e-24	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.832292174953	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
1.0	2.45049608433e-07	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.130859432034	And you know what?
0.0	1.79696238896e-61	That's good.
0.0	0.000405607691852	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.999998274737	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.130859432034	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	5.11596775695e-39	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.130859432034	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	3.24490549876e-15	I'm a free trader.
0.0	3.85812323892e-31	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	1.0	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.130859432034	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	5.55780184576e-10	That's what we need.
0.0	3.44027911891e-26	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.899895610734	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.130859432034	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.130859432034	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	2.11969320874e-07	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.999999999045	I never said that.
1.0	0.938497578297	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	1.01292210078e-20	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.999999999999	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.130859432034	You just want to...
0.0	0.130859432034	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	3.69640089245e-83	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.973408317197	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.84926774708	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.130859432034	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	4.20168217047e-24	That's what I'm working towards.
1.0	0.338265207697	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.000478348312456	No, no.
0.0	0.900387700481	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	4.94016049755e-16	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	8.30277383846e-56	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.845155726442	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.706280951439	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	8.48928620764e-47	...is paid -- played fairly.

0.0	0.130859432034	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.

0.0	4.1878271946e-30	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	1.5608289165e-15	It's not my PAC.

0.0	0.130859432034	You know, I am by my nature impatient.

0.0	0.130859432034	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.130859432034	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.

0.0	0.130859432034	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.

0.0	0.817169587985	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.130859432034	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	9.87253829749e-13	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.881479871146	But I was born here.
0.0	0.130859432034	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	3.91796311385e-14	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.130859432034	And you know what?
0.0	0.130859432034	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.918616827461	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.812754010231	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	2.63824368779e-63	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.905029000033	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	3.10243646063e-56	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.130859432034	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.130859432034	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.913651224234	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.9999968941	You did.
0.0	8.05296719043e-31	This country is changing.
0.0	0.99715626055	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	9.25912570723e-24	I want security for this country.
0.0	5.79104206389e-27	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.130859432034	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	5.1513992682e-29	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	7.44972310648e-13	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.264632507942	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	4.29222720863e-22	Or somebody else.
0.0	1.85272348203e-18	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.681617969944	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.130859432034	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	2.22569805116e-34	About Medicare?
0.0	0.982277689529	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.130859432034	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	1.41146020217e-25	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.899770270439	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.130859432034	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.999999867307	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.130859432034	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	1.31522270902e-21	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1.0	1.22806414282e-25	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	2.07390329056e-15	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.999999019933	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	2.22566358562e-37	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.130859432034	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.973306305477	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.999999677272	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	1.96625084235e-06	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	3.63198279486e-34	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.130859432034	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.895717035129	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.130859432034	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	2.49923199072e-63	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	9.08694338507e-35	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.866859907118	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.130859432034	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.932793877264	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.92861393605	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	4.20775724066e-19	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	2.65280184429e-14	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.929429938574	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	1.00527829767e-27	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.130859432034	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.823570683505	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.890681527491	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.130859432034	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.130859432034	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	5.50246766767e-14	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.0882201243708	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.998786464317	We can do a wall.
0.0	7.84130950859e-37	The answer is no.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	2.36436833121e-19	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.88345914964	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	2.30460303842e-52	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	3.06768656254e-20	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	4.03449009413e-06	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.794268189607	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're going to end up in the same place.
1.0	0.130859432034	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.343716634444	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	3.85952539323e-58	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.130859432034	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	3.50072101837e-24	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.528962139261	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.130859432034	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.00101039143972	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.937655316708	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	6.87449754334e-29	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.130859432034	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	8.61210803783e-15	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.99999989348	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.130859432034	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.512789774727	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.844311714718	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.130859432034	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.541324483294	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.956132095771	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	2.21547337303e-22	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.130859432034	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	2.79326968082e-26	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	6.16750775835e-68	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	6.92741706484e-15	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	1.19147079178e-53	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.999999928131	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.902054465204	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	2.99478083617e-70	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.130859432034	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.130859432034	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.986394575876	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.00615519758753	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	2.19662074382e-24	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.999281177205	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.130859432034	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.0374863335162	Take it to the bank.
0.0	3.51095363086e-62	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.000125658445987	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.130859432034	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	1.49574229859e-39	That's what they're doing.
0.0	3.61014787885e-16	I'm prepared.
0.0	6.26520203613e-21	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.994167105272	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.842791661825	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	1.74560917484e-26	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.130859432034	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.626853825214	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
1.0	0.980771962916	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.993525157287	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.130859432034	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	1.24510409766e-74	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.130859432034	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	1.10342238762e-08	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.130859432034	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.236588971155	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.765326819115	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.130859432034	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.130859432034	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	2.34325497196e-41	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.999999946261	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.912539820908	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	1.96464537697e-23	I want security.
0.0	5.65613667187e-67	...
0.0	4.86171589932e-20	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	1.98538596824e-78	...No, sir...
0.0	0.130859432034	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	1.13408642714e-18	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.9999996963	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.130859432034	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.835392069157	Of course you are right.
0.0	6.57557989158e-34	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.999976399287	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.908368060476	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	1.70875060347e-14	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.130859432034	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.130859432034	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.93477298738	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	7.05324877689e-50	It never happens.
0.0	2.08078155433e-27	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	1.42182949473e-45	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.72125929512	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	5.65613667187e-67	...
0.0	0.130859432034	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.130859432034	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	6.35171605868e-38	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	6.07522284148e-21	People aren't dumb.
0.0	1.0	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.999958324562	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	1.05598676948e-74	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.792620417289	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	3.88230151352e-34	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.899844640357	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	3.10530427868e-20	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	4.36243494417e-21	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.130859432034	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.130859432034	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.999999960442	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.826709762362	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.130859432034	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.00113695192184	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	1.57067540857e-18	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.999999737712	No, absolutely not.
0.0	4.40573455553e-20	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.130859432034	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	5.23414676713e-14	Well, I don't know.
1.0	0.130859432034	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	1.01165748655e-36	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.130859432034	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.999999977259	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.130859432034	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.921269323803	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.130859432034	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.999999999771	They were wrong.
0.0	3.70578145034e-10	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.130859432034	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
1.0	0.908740480363	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.130859432034	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.878785960003	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	1.0	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.00691190265965	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	9.85585205253e-19	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	2.54890693156e-14	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	1.6648817376e-13	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	2.01149098263e-40	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.130859432034	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	5.19292846866e-24	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.71903221875	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.887597965543	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	6.79839248038e-48	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
1.0	0.945253516125	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.934669112859	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.130859432034	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.99996406203	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	3.17030109461e-12	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.20025387463	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.786603442454	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.130859432034	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	6.27451957341e-17	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	5.24194332732e-42	It is.
0.0	0.130859432034	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	1.44444944588e-58	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.130859432034	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
1.0	0.998570758023	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.130859432034	And you know what?
0.0	1.39037612288e-22	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.785173963727	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	2.76192297287e-73	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	1.95757604379e-26	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.791310954716	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.999997750487	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.130859432034	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.130859432034	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	4.96803173284e-13	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.931763213034	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	2.95204881035e-12	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	4.69125075664e-06	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.840930913027	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	1.38062623044e-21	It's peanuts.
0.0	3.49669740333e-17	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	1.54614437463e-30	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	3.50055536967e-19	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
1.0	0.922630562432	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	3.69730161363e-11	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.903002883827	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	8.87027395235e-21	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.130859432034	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.953284959434	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.999999999427	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.130859432034	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	5.61903910284e-18	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.130859432034	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	2.55729969283e-112	...Chris...
0.0	0.130859432034	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.556364476491	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.130859432034	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.130859432034	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.130859432034	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	4.15349936051e-37	No their not.
0.0	0.130859432034	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.130859432034	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.130859432034	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.022832650295	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.999880581727	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.00292978383165	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.130859432034	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.130859432034	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.130859432034	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.94047811348	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.130859432034	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	1.73790510484e-19	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	8.06738947694e-15	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	4.44966513247e-11	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	9.47209065886e-36	My point is this.
0.0	3.27342751315e-37	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.568298460701	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.999999999045	I never said that.
0.0	0.130859432034	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.999666963781	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.99999492159	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.130859432034	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.643175372803	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.130859432034	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	4.57871689558e-56	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.999999424419	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.884909875982	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.130859432034	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.574990103389	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	1.0	No, you did.
0.0	2.53272164729e-57	Play by the rules.
0.0	1.80480666022e-15	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	1.13929112666e-16	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	3.8705928721e-27	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.997721369904	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.921521485095	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.999999999999	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.999999979192	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	1.0	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	3.19906259605e-10	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	1.27657226831e-37	Thank you.
0.0	3.93014305763e-13	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.990953637391	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.130859432034	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.988346659875	He is a good man.
0.0	5.66391374016e-05	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.999999999916	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	1.287898222e-13	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	4.14385070341e-18	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.452836184143	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.920468212445	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.99999999639	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.130859432034	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	2.6534279496e-18	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	4.20666203755e-06	I will put a price tag.
1.0	0.937952626219	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.303659838092	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.444195983608	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.999999935853	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.841647458722	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.130859432034	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	6.24110522217e-26	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.130859432034	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.999787002237	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.130859432034	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.51972258666	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	2.9857048877e-63	It's not that hard.
0.0	9.6892865824e-06	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
1.0	0.130859432034	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.999999967731	Can we stop?
0.0	0.916150222683	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.933809892212	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.130859432034	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.000635559854419	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	6.83009862461e-28	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.130859432034	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	9.23073626708e-49	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.130859432034	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
1.0	0.891452027655	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.991955503257	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.892657914361	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
1.0	0.130859432034	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	4.30226450382e-16	You know why?
0.0	1.83889081794e-15	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.982839794994	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.130859432034	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.893973426104	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.845017739113	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.130859432034	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.130859432034	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	1.80700377738e-15	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.130859432034	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.999999045295	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.934497178157	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	2.19504671201e-07	And I think together we will make progress.
1.0	0.774731595044	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	5.16356701656e-17	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.941487725465	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.00137198894024	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	8.85980287315e-05	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.99990232974	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.752847428205	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.999571137363	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	9.53165506267e-10	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.130859432034	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	8.96181494301e-26	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.999959975708	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.977880522518	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.130859432034	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	1.08650279131e-19	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	3.30733749221e-53	Yeah.
0.0	0.130859432034	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.130859432034	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	4.21234810637e-126	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	1.27657226831e-37	Thank you.
0.0	0.299055265812	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.130859432034	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.999932236738	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	2.06233261099e-16	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	5.60511026222e-29	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.130859432034	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.130859432034	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.850343452053	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.960868952894	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
1.0	0.495571163897	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.729821117479	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.983746599544	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.998571583375	What have you got now?

0.0	0.935712127991	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.

0.0	0.00578687535559	And we got to look at the big picture here.

0.0	0.251609180547	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	1.52898432858e-25	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	5.26407754289e-06	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need to know who our neighbors are.

0.0	0.130859432034	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.130859432034	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.999995254764	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.

0.0	2.62526792976e-29	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.729719481913	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	3.15120477918e-74	It's not responsible.
0.0	3.30733749221e-53	OK?
0.0	0.90396744139	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	2.26634426923e-17	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	3.79272406504e-56	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.856815751329	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.130859432034	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.999999990524	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	4.61208293918e-10	I'm aware of that.
0.0	7.19040140769e-32	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.130859432034	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	1.52013542833e-72	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.999999955163	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	4.6033622699e-18	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.130859432034	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	3.97942986138e-29	Think about it.
0.0	4.1492857826e-28	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.130859432034	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.999999306621	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	2.05291152976e-39	You looking at me?
0.0	4.39086878397e-35	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.55700985869	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.130859432034	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.800236103917	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.130859432034	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	6.7820826963e-43	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.0172469052354	(inaudible).
0.0	0.130859432034	I want to take care of women.

0.0	0.130859432034	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	1.83800956945e-28	No.
0.0	0.0145303802066	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.130859432034	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.130859432034	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.130859432034	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.999910827671	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.922255931282	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.130859432034	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.91412874317	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.130859432034	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	8.71858373392e-12	We need to reverse that.
0.0	1.0777133903e-34	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.130859432034	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.367287036256	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.130859432034	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.938677361369	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.876539497627	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	3.00393070175e-20	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.130859432034	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.130859432034	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	6.55423682035e-29	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.130859432034	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	2.39884483572e-29	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	1.56031641227e-82	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.130859432034	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.682611109092	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,

0.0	1.39476174336e-24	We hear a lot of good plans.
1.0	0.925668210283	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	2.09692643716e-12	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	1.65926480983e-09	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.981336370812	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.130859432034	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.0841146220075	They're very, very badly wounded.

0.0	0.934908028358	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.130859432034	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	2.20656759238e-10	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.00466850872046	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	1.22740606524e-18	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.

0.0	0.130859432034	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.130859432034	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	6.04645125867e-41	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.857177721563	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.

0.0	1.0	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.744592844639	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	1.76492247805e-25	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.130859432034	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	1.40984965644e-05	No, the new planes.
0.0	1.80069367645e-20	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	3.30733749221e-53	OK.
0.0	0.000710482260106	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.130859432034	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.130859432034	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.959952411522	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	1.65765879745e-09	But she did say there was anger.

0.0	0.99999289555	They're a scam.
0.0	0.130859432034	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.84606314335	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
1.0	0.37908022912	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.

0.0	0.999981418305	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.130859432034	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	5.33313298734e-17	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.130859432034	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.780850857869	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.468764338692	Look, that's who I stand up for.

0.0	0.958094790336	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.

0.0	5.02356033359e-20	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.532455843173	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.130859432034	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.130859432034	So we have work to do.
0.0	4.8707284805e-32	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
1.0	0.443643196235	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

0.0	8.6847253071e-12	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.542396094011	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	1.08017099241e-28	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.130859432034	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	1.63493059249e-36	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.130859432034	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	1.22611993871e-16	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	1.14427958879e-17	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.609850398736	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.130859432034	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.

0.0	2.66074763663e-37	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.567070738985	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.130859432034	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.130859432034	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.691771998347	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	6.49033480236e-33	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.946822979993	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.999354718088	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.999999999188	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	1.0	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.130859432034	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	1.04833422843e-32	Absolutely.
0.0	0.130859432034	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.956686825245	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.902175042099	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	2.34250041378e-18	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	4.21461046294e-53	How about this?
0.0	0.130859432034	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.130859432034	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	6.25725285588e-15	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.130859432034	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
1.0	0.999973719445	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.130859432034	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.130859432034	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.994728037724	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	4.72932484203e-08	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
1.0	0.986894690692	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.0139981899121	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.999999643171	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.130859432034	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	6.70884819855e-54	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	5.28635876961e-07	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.999999999996	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.999614519543	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.130859432034	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.130859432034	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.130859432034	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.130859432034	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	3.30733749221e-53	OK?
0.0	0.935903847639	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.999999679833	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.130859432034	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.130859432034	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.130859432034	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.130859432034	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.999999627453	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.130859432034	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
1.0	0.999999999806	They stole it.
0.0	0.994198539333	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.997602247056	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.931937011711	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.130859432034	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	4.77775373685e-14	We need Jordan.
0.0	6.96381419896e-17	We were wrong.
0.0	0.291141101742	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	3.06438037541e-30	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.130859432034	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.130859432034	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	8.89115941927e-94	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.334504403046	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.809861319745	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	7.10225411977e-14	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	8.19678602127e-05	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.130859432034	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.821008081209	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.897526190062	We were behind where we were today.
1.0	0.507143843267	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.99999967788	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	2.86785516821e-19	They are not perfect.
0.0	1.61564287808e-19	I like that.
0.0	0.130859432034	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	3.95873852082e-28	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.768788730728	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.999946171096	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	1.63374574792e-79	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.905079818535	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.130859432034	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.999999964905	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
1.0	0.888677634521	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.999999996399	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.557707411976	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.130859432034	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.998908192903	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.875431766116	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.748140182051	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.442144983329	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.795005241856	I said no.
0.0	0.831383269203	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.130859432034	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.130859432034	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.927378348987	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	2.81224789241e-22	She said the truth.
0.0	0.130859432034	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.999759534973	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.130859432034	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.130859432034	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.894191854326	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.951626753791	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	1.81330086531e-15	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.985964698837	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	1.57025134071e-15	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	2.5596504214e-28	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.130859432034	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	3.47930046454e-14	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.00392824845556	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.130859432034	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.923851895715	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.604338402688	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.130859432034	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.999994789221	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	7.55062786801e-68	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.886641816388	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.901659615876	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.448575320567	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.130859432034	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.530323921988	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	1.0	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	2.5021201859e-06	People are upset about it.
0.0	2.63573760187e-15	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	3.53709093998e-33	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	9.9050719674e-86	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.130859432034	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.000631703301306	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.130859432034	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.873847921867	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.000258988295726	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.526674135641	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.999999591911	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	4.02289685492e-14	I have no illusion.
0.0	3.89733605865e-31	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.999999796207	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.229512496688	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.130859432034	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
1.0	0.130859432034	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.996024435077	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.887823349237	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	2.8428835719e-07	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.130859432034	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
1.0	0.130859432034	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.130859432034	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	2.19373623723e-47	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	1.94016655529e-08	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	3.8311115832e-19	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.913066161654	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.130859432034	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.999999999882	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.130859432034	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	2.75682895296e-05	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.924465559977	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.999999435038	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.713385258668	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.823755318175	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.99999350191	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.130859432034	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.999999999045	I never said that.
0.0	0.130859432034	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	1.59073695114e-31	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.801136137461	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	1.30537335376e-19	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	3.06438037541e-30	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.999995096444	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	1.96010651591e-34	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.130859432034	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	9.8496071958e-08	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.999512269995	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.130859432034	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	1.27657226831e-37	Thank you.
0.0	0.130859432034	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.925500299202	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.187144387902	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.130859432034	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.980681009701	A brief response.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	5.09242645837e-31	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.912584778522	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	4.54968682441e-42	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.991607094838	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	1.00505359518e-64	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	1.78957687603e-32	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.682423195432	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.902070020251	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
1.0	0.873005186749	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.11334210193	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.995738641109	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	5.33042881799e-30	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
1.0	0.999732550997	Very few children.
0.0	0.130859432034	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	9.16788333095e-08	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.130859432034	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?

0.0	0.130859432034	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.130859432034	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	3.55234254172e-47	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.130859432034	But I want to go further.
0.0	1.87122525165e-16	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.130859432034	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.130859432034	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.915088774545	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.130859432034	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.

0.0	0.130859432034	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.130859432034	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	1.86585204076e-14	They know.

0.0	0.805263063281	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	3.97722286465e-11	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.130859432034	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.999996567943	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.130859432034	My state is doing great across the board.
1.0	0.899306222878	We borrow a million dollars a minute.

0.0	0.330180016588	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	8.42445857986e-42	Think about that.
0.0	0.130859432034	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.130859432034	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.815042973915	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.

0.0	1.04833422843e-32	Dynamically.
0.0	0.130859432034	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.130859432034	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.953077834027	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.

0.0	6.63883746514e-09	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.999999998268	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.972181969225	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.130859432034	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.130859432034	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	3.0828806059e-67	But I would add this.

0.0	0.565509082822	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.999990728308	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.130859432034	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
1.0	0.426139485387	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.

0.0	0.130859432034	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.00454896201733	You don't know it, they tax us.

0.0	3.30733749221e-53	Yes.
0.0	0.130859432034	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	1.23214789139e-31	That's for sure.
0.0	0.899608258698	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	3.10301984022e-12	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.988945205438	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	2.14451602423e-14	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.935240140792	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	1.38730111732e-10	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.130859432034	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.00443091535384	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	1.61343308337e-19	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.921084030003	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.000517619873928	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.999999582431	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	5.02414540522e-21	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	3.58864710508e-09	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.130859432034	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.922299829723	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.49473654533	This is 2016.
0.0	0.130859432034	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.908805822279	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	1.27657226831e-37	Thank you.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	1.2663600506e-41	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.825172354718	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	3.37618923681e-23	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.130859432034	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.130859432034	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	1.0	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	8.24082729369e-09	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	2.70400931778e-23	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.999999893969	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.130859432034	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.925428525483	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
1.0	0.915009488155	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.927762353486	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	1.24814726692e-08	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.935172483521	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	5.29313761348e-38	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	4.6426600079e-11	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.949095499295	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.130859432034	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
1.0	0.00150808293202	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.305825532056	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.827961824079	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	9.08164076576e-27	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.538588165872	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.998143328474	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.998029298452	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.130859432034	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	5.30646178263e-60	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	3.11273746884e-34	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.999999164694	I will do that.
0.0	0.130859432034	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	1.37049128603e-40	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	1.0	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	1.60797732327e-32	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.899776463768	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.998466672392	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.999999862189	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.130859432034	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.130859432034	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.999999967221	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.130859432034	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.130859432034	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.846816993701	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.130859432034	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.130859432034	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.130859432034	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	6.85613856288e-13	No one is a socialist.
1.0	0.130859432034	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.999999999999	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	1.04833422843e-32	Absolutely.
0.0	0.618713844995	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
1.0	2.37299866695e-14	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.130859432034	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.999958590134	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.554677892794	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	8.50470847614e-35	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.999999927309	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.999999992362	It's not fair trade.
1.0	0.130859432034	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.130859432034	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.049132212696	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.130859432034	Right there, right next to the plant.
1.0	9.30541052956e-15	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	3.18339012246e-22	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	1.03573962975e-36	That's not right.
0.0	1.18076087966e-45	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.130859432034	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	6.77772536401e-10	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.955397435745	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.130859432034	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.130859432034	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.130859432034	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	2.81991711581e-15	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.130859432034	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	6.10838310735e-25	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	1.52085979643e-25	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.827859588354	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	1.29149465817e-50	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	1.05387896913e-14	You're welcome.
0.0	0.988422108311	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	1.0	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	8.91226769842e-66	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.672376588125	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	5.37887545893e-08	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.380433195861	You're right.
0.0	2.05168779608e-17	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.130859432034	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.130859432034	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
1.0	0.897135783257	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.

0.0	7.69423145735e-25	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.99945070817	I win.
0.0	0.998466205642	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	4.12707228596e-21	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.130859432034	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.130859432034	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.130859432034	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.899891995002	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	1.0	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	4.55357904263e-18	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.99987971935	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.965579501703	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.933516457748	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	1.37429003549e-68	That has not been...
0.0	0.893665266808	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
1.0	0.882929381719	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.785695071579	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.130859432034	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	4.69534178884e-84	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.780133271903	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.130859432034	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	4.98352104463e-40	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.130859432034	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.130859432034	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	2.56876868568e-30	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.999993835251	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.999999999045	I never said that.
0.0	0.907461581963	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.130859432034	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.130859432034	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	3.81118989243e-19	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.0012121348055	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.999999676143	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.576053772222	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.999650296304	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.130859432034	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	4.41082090215e-48	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	1.85336613495e-21	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.130859432034	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
1.0	1.24132995073e-23	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	1.01817210701e-17	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.130859432034	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	1.05355311253e-12	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.896587971788	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	2.02601371162e-23	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.738023236675	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	3.50505306531e-08	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	1.83800956945e-28	No.
0.0	0.130859432034	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.130859432034	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.99999999829	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.999999995958	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	7.13731732337e-60	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.514846985019	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.999998493704	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.130859432034	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	4.50536164745e-07	You can have him.
0.0	0.130859432034	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.0625886505991	They go to Harvard.
0.0	3.24490549876e-15	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.999977429943	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	1.70177454253e-30	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	2.90544338782e-17	We need to stop that.
0.0	1.69084680203e-38	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	5.67056329528e-14	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	2.42424922987e-43	But, I would also add this.
0.0	1.05735196326e-33	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	2.39793652877e-25	I recommended that the president go forward.
1.0	8.18883855244e-37	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	2.89320274132e-17	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	3.44027911891e-26	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.819936303938	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.130859432034	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.130859432034	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.182417225609	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.130859432034	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.130859432034	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	2.59147909508e-09	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.518885488233	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.130859432034	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	1.28256850804e-25	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.755536281189	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	2.9992777233e-14	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.999090504796	This is a bad deal.
0.0	1.66233030875e-28	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	2.78647883698e-12	How do I know this?
0.0	0.130859432034	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.130859432034	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.130859432034	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.883807017197	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.130859432034	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
1.0	0.888701894028	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.130859432034	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.861561371093	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.130859432034	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	5.17479676713e-78	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.130859432034	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	1.82449982021e-44	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.554777272421	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.130859432034	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	3.91663582396e-24	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.962598552176	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.8297518407	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.130859432034	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.389772409784	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	4.1376799169e-09	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.999999999633	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.130859432034	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.130859432034	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.898707227859	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.871643592535	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	1.82124000317e-11	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	6.20034615196e-37	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	7.07667864044e-12	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	1.35984531213e-17	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	2.6534279496e-18	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	1.0	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.999854263495	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	5.79553600912e-33	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.999764557658	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.130859432034	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.912935132285	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.130859432034	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	1.09880815357e-56	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	2.21547337303e-22	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.684898131518	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.130859432034	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	7.52798942746e-10	No, John.
0.0	0.130859432034	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.500464854636	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
1.0	9.20242689387e-76	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.000188661996009	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.999999980982	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.130859432034	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	3.30733749221e-53	Yes.
0.0	0.985675524066	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	2.3462413571e-21	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	3.46520705926e-13	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.682873177412	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
1.0	0.724618394809	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	8.06099090522e-73	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.999966787992	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.918465815624	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.62882513126	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	1.96480332313e-37	in particular.
0.0	0.260824104972	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.467477293621	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.990066963654	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	3.19728656531e-27	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	2.83141976389e-18	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.999997975486	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.885972162077	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.999999172395	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.130859432034	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.999907741593	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.929209259683	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	2.77250444584e-51	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.130859432034	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.130859432034	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.843419707234	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.94400532671	I will not do that.
0.0	1.0	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.881112599526	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.000106958774602	It's a hard problem.
0.0	5.15184963738e-112	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.939947878284	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	3.16689358038e-25	I want security for this country.
0.0	3.49458439609e-27	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	2.74727992896e-11	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	1.70799724663e-130	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.966953440655	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.130859432034	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	5.31302131891e-94	That is...
0.0	0.932133395901	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.818920025554	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.987938747358	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.130859432034	You count on it.
0.0	5.99304307308e-24	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	1.77088232189e-34	What should we do?
0.0	0.939923572232	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	4.5049306591e-31	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.99999941717	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.893149641126	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.130859432034	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.999991760793	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.

0.0	0.307459537935	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.

0.0	0.130859432034	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.954233329524	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.448210816613	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.989738700625	You have to lead.
0.0	0.130859432034	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.130859432034	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.130859432034	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.923496225995	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.378604651706	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.999999242336	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.999953805869	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.130859432034	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	6.1678685978e-16	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.000667428038534	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	1.25596694965e-05	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.

0.0	0.130859432034	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?

0.0	0.999104106962	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	3.72867668627e-07	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.999963081033	We're not doing it.
0.0	1.09522821377e-18	Yeah, he said everybody.

0.0	3.50451363889e-24	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.999085175183	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.938645721914	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	1.83800956945e-28	No.
0.0	0.766702350825	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.

0.0	0.999999999992	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	3.30733749221e-53	Yes.

0.0	0.999711947135	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.999945079694	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.130859432034	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.

0.0	0.920220641123	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	1.24184904639e-11	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.130859432034	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.451790442783	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.967224692161	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.130859432034	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.130859432034	I know how to do that.
1.0	0.883655164694	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.130859432034	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.

0.0	0.130859432034	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.999999999382	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.999999924563	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.686218637046	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	3.36586105843e-32	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.130859432034	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.956416485674	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.721390304443	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.649886397564	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.884553155017	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.130859432034	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.130859432034	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.993469847107	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.130859432034	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	1.09155609655e-30	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	9.00299397755e-13	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.130859432034	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	1.81875301297e-23	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.130859432034	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.547226607679	Just ditto to that.
0.0	1.16873444983e-30	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.897138071481	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
1.0	0.917686872522	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.999999808066	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	3.92545553782e-07	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	1.44789086999e-30	I came as a reformer.
0.0	5.25381190757e-46	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.130859432034	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.156628969315	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	8.9725420835e-15	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	3.409304159e-37	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.130859432034	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.999999999999	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.130859432034	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.

0.0	0.999999598207	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.999962176785	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.99941685112	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
1.0	0.854808781166	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.877029951621	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.130859432034	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	1.20289089335e-12	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	9.36479122017e-68	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.130859432034	But you know what?
0.0	0.130859432034	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.998904650181	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
1.0	0.95245552274	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	3.80868112128e-24	You do.
0.0	0.896403110109	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	4.24173990447e-05	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.130859432034	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	5.90715293534e-31	Let em also tell you...

0.0	4.30226450382e-16	You know why?
0.0	0.937366277377	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.992065232052	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.92056890768	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.130859432034	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.999999564204	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.825183034157	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.130859432034	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	8.49967821224e-54	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	9.50688436381e-20	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	1.07686118361e-20	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.999999961986	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.130859432034	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.130859432034	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	1.32427172205e-14	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.130859432034	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.999977174086	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.130859432034	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
