0.0	0.00039557374412	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.187246776636	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	1.20699601837e-05	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	2.05502190588e-08	I have no illusion.
0.0	9.7383011977e-23	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.999999999919	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.00131809741893	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.000388657558235	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.999990321583	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.0134608504219	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	2.96811117609e-10	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	5.09408631477e-10	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	3.60619474689e-08	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
1.0	0.999988352123	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	1.26941922608e-49	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	9.95988824049e-12	I will do that.

0.0	0.839904685855	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	2.63561960843e-07	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.777114045005	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.000998854136565	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.000340992852827	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	2.03579563411e-07	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.92766264465	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.

0.0	1.41667269827e-08	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.00124561250434	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	8.79972827579e-05	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.0249714070972	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	1.0	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	7.66569453465e-14	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.996209133274	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
1.0	0.993064862925	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.0247594368659	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.00363282066751	It never happens.

0.0	0.091013413409	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	7.05861580329e-12	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.000595504508529	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.396120667121	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	2.80224536181e-24	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.999928567467	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	5.53412188602e-14	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.000733994969723	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.

0.0	1.27962881694e-09	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.0338788079285	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.0194450472186	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	2.72258614658e-21	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.00133486472933	And, we said no.
0.0	5.04305084156e-11	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	6.00397846442e-08	They are refusing to...

0.0	0.998506753295	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.999973613401	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	1.46032943963e-07	And, folks, we will.

0.0	8.47590168623e-05	There are lids on people's aspirations.
1.0	0.129715021635	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.999539086649	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	2.4198780181e-09	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	1.34456845594e-27	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	3.60229265435e-13	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.907646062243	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.

0.0	0.999999901576	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	2.60289954861e-21	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	6.37227462489e-05	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	1.38886984927e-08	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.999999104435	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.181787072756	So I have voiced criticisms.
1.0	1.0	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
1.0	0.994878134276	They stole it.
0.0	0.99997792615	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.999998800627	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.991212710937	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.975145850116	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.999987496144	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.789808995967	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	1.95679613924e-05	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	1.0	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	1.76789595161e-13	And you know what?
0.0	5.24851826587e-14	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	1.97741447706e-05	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.999999998795	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.999999963948	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	1.74925988017e-07	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	8.05797711381e-06	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	2.32357856565e-17	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.999995104127	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.0773741871461	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	8.48200982136e-33	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	9.20450031151e-18	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	1.0	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	7.45430217796e-11	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.998023184611	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	2.28214127108e-09	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	9.30298194036e-17	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.908188432762	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	2.26249415168e-07	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.

0.0	0.999999994304	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.893204863024	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	7.78393679897e-07	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.189006484358	I do.
0.0	0.999966333646	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.834895108639	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	1.90067238909e-06	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.999999979289	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.999910340881	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?

1.0	0.0240958237124	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	3.17603386124e-08	I don't like that.
0.0	0.99999212472	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	5.5821002575e-06	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.999999984186	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.0726511334273	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	4.49424390985e-06	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	1.48049944309e-19	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.187246776636	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	1.65730894911e-05	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.

0.0	1.0	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	3.31450655971e-07	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	1.0	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	1.04982612753e-19	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.

0.0	0.987250355786	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	1.77600496094e-28	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.

0.0	0.997978322072	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	3.19533152949e-06	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	1.0	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.000399070889736	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.99999989368	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	1.25313927045e-15	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.993824638592	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.999767724359	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.77514746354	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.719835336612	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	1.69466664113e-10	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	6.83786064951e-07	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.0547691881505	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	4.92545473735e-07	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	3.78233620243e-10	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.899414143792	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.0193546570585	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	3.64250678329e-22	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.

1.0	0.998635993233	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	5.4017861169e-09	That will change everything.
0.0	7.97403142877e-12	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.000380353673982	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
1.0	1.0	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.999102009137	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.9999989847	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	1.13147309261e-08	No.
0.0	6.3987067677e-15	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.

1.0	0.0213007857559	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	5.43538406409e-12	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	6.38150415864e-06	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.00226865241313	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.999999997018	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.401990219196	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.00796413495125	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	1.0	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.999915847165	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	1.5087208596e-06	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.999999999328	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.971597008591	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	6.81474473768e-20	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	2.15512809114e-16	The worker's out of a job.

0.0	1.0	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.682887196318	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	6.91434550933e-05	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	2.57957831159e-13	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."

0.0	1.12933382385e-08	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	3.80509211375e-14	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.999999998712	They are trying to attack us here in America.
1.0	0.000596542567034	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.308599464591	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.319656244773	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	2.20524106265e-13	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.999871986757	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.999990777435	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.992594403538	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	1.54091374347e-05	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	1.47737121332e-12	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.971357183273	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.000615289269536	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	1.0	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	3.60087078424e-06	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.0273932072353	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.971477759431	She voted for it.
0.0	0.0798596169382	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	4.54630168055e-06	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	1.86657658154e-18	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.999999633523	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	3.93404971946e-08	Not bad.
0.0	0.999998797491	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.859213553773	I love China.
0.0	8.44947130917e-22	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.999996202169	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.999999999929	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.999993787386	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.99999999063	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	1.0	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.00298770431724	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	7.14063170845e-10	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.0125473901973	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.999894069913	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	8.14286668319e-08	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.000102261371389	He is a good man.
0.0	0.999997205339	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.98365465656	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	2.00255552687e-06	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	1.0547609906e-18	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	2.0137244404e-09	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.000581765181049	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.999996075889	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.997353791468	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	1.0	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	5.6070698564e-13	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.999994415951	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	2.64340666271e-16	You know why?
0.0	3.87781624622e-12	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.999996510374	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.00601947616883	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.978053587314	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	2.31331851419e-13	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	4.07887726954e-28	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.000946518374509	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.989270557752	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.999874150714	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	1.64127859732e-13	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	2.42803062156e-11	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.999999995845	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	2.14180766896e-21	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.0021551616733	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	1.56028715305e-20	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.0160379124673	It's not constitutional.
0.0	9.53264176939e-09	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	3.9732862636e-19	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.851847922596	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.902589518295	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	4.49616245376e-09	It's peanuts.
0.0	5.11827508372e-12	But I would add this.
0.0	1.23708606341e-07	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.972290663533	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.981401479225	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	2.88826902762e-11	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	1.0	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.000520707341252	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.00218574496131	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.0302358342797	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.00120079962962	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.000179652880538	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.999796740032	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.998468875805	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.99060923915	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	5.38840077341e-12	No, it's true.
0.0	0.169786145038	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.999998757276	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	3.76131897571e-19	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.128520814048	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.999146936778	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	3.31136020545e-08	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.961830283483	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.834811630261	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	1.91051500749e-11	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.999999780129	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
1.0	0.996693088031	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	7.20203922572e-20	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.999999999382	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	1.55386697002e-14	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	1.28761744301e-13	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.0986623977088	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	1.45179909716e-09	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.987637458743	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	3.07298986821e-11	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.999999605604	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.998369361831	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	6.76088772912e-05	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.967921269967	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.0516585904772	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.997041061967	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.181474656354	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.000999396847987	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	1.19980047063e-12	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	5.05093437189e-06	That's fine.
0.0	0.994219149529	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	5.46585673506e-11	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.89126368769	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.999999999385	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.000161351198892	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.99998538735	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	9.41014577594e-21	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	4.73606789153e-07	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	1.02618741864e-09	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.620360324219	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.966361056143	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.0189431001609	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.999999900829	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	3.08736074613e-12	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.00177286752819	Thank you.

0.0	0.99902402822	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	1.15517667697e-18	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	1.06476901943e-11	This is extraordinary.
0.0	4.29154356518e-20	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	1.09641150894e-18	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.00303035642069	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	1.70974669284e-26	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	2.15250683187e-34	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.998630066308	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.999999999788	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.998468369518	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.997752383037	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.97240405496	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	9.9010374108e-05	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.999998859489	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	3.65730692305e-18	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.999996719318	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.972631849678	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.000693341215471	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.000241452387816	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.902589518295	We had Hamas.
0.0	5.07114388497e-05	Right.
0.0	1.1470077145e-30	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.999998954157	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.99999996461	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	6.70317104339e-06	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.00410439857411	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.999999686348	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.999619085406	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	5.67926542998e-07	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	3.44059417455e-13	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.0188021570002	We need to stop that.
0.0	5.71812784099e-30	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	5.33755327596e-07	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	2.08856000897e-06	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.972474785936	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	3.80548216844e-05	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	3.42204904111e-08	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	2.16543237415e-06	And I want to make this our government.
1.0	8.57593432425e-09	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.999188822571	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.0412270073501	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	1.20850829469e-11	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.244672500919	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	5.18937835766e-10	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	3.34643922092e-12	Yeah.
0.0	3.51606261785e-07	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.997806520494	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.219961217341	Credibility counts.
1.0	9.59636209557e-06	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	9.31180403027e-08	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	1.29629598636e-05	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	3.17603386124e-08	They don't like that.
0.0	0.00155039599956	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	3.52579914461e-25	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.0090459727157	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	1.03934214748e-05	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.00614650136292	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	1.93119508273e-05	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	3.54025934854e-14	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	2.0597764457e-09	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.999467417958	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.999856044044	I would change them.
0.0	0.999999999994	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
1.0	0.999999999994	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	4.28275576167e-18	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
1.0	0.99525159148	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	1.01837836375e-09	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.998618253112	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.760033464211	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.215471269696	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	1.15479916133e-18	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	1.09455170281e-17	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	1.89397595913e-09	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	1.0	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	3.11071186184e-12	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.0544248388514	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	1.0	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.829653913603	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	1.93751699129e-13	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	1.24028677221e-13	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	2.62071283643e-11	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.436116482911	You're right.
0.0	0.998445860387	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	2.16218961127e-07	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.720691771337	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.961065840732	They're a scam.
0.0	3.47610689011e-25	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	5.05093437189e-06	That's fine.
0.0	0.999950554595	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.854676687222	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.288975128758	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.00290678366639	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	1.48517214599e-12	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
1.0	0.999711572841	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	1.74301832704e-07	We have a country of laws.
1.0	0.851038389971	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.99999999997	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
1.0	0.997761466209	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	8.61613680713e-10	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.994172302046	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	9.537942417e-09	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	6.49196118919e-15	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	6.45052312286e-09	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.515429970804	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	7.83306523871e-07	See?
0.0	1.64349334934e-29	And here's why.
0.0	1.18811326989e-17	I think you're --
0.0	0.999927275614	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.999994529522	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.0235001388398	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	6.1554333649e-07	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.999999920889	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.999999920644	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.999999999887	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	1.08036990416e-05	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.00637812743501	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	2.47487054032e-12	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	5.12642028187e-22	No -- no...
0.0	1.78627481458e-05	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.987540157311	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.99999773022	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	1.16900693865e-05	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	1.64486643138e-28	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.00787711989143	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.999155482176	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	1.88738429839e-12	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	1.26581110914e-20	That's what he is.
0.0	0.999999996028	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.144593902559	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.996886331357	We were wrong.
0.0	0.928223025379	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	6.09222152845e-07	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.105803265359	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	1.78399941468e-24	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	4.70660373368e-22	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
1.0	0.999947876188	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	2.13348180642e-20	But, here is the truth.
0.0	3.70396201528e-12	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	5.68213976489e-19	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	7.80943486128e-06	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	1.91243648067e-11	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.300892976451	Total propaganda.
0.0	3.02147737398e-13	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	3.41517801372e-05	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.000324009709697	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	1.25923177042e-15	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.676450658341	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.000100505535938	You're welcome.
0.0	0.475127628434	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	1.72208288701e-05	You can't have a question.
0.0	6.7442374195e-06	Well, a couple of things.
1.0	4.14233111513e-05	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.0136357965996	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.00023627572123	But this is nothing new.
0.0	5.66554357834e-05	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.000135706008655	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.454814736107	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.000315268238537	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	6.44242402119e-10	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	4.64216644468e-10	How are we going to do this?
0.0	6.28435126941e-08	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	1.50222555846e-16	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.999999999999	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.000384110124196	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.999807746889	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	1.66290861849e-15	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.996338691115	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.999839972166	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	2.35768288206e-10	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.776229814084	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.774056808356	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	4.63780999759e-05	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.99995173061	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.652441427714	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	3.97101296045e-10	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	1.13147309261e-08	No.
0.0	0.999146148458	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.00136676388396	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.00266517534394	Progressives don't believe that.
1.0	0.999823162671	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	5.76573093316e-07	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.00951954604736	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.00347122678695	You count on it.
1.0	0.999840714017	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.999952223868	I want to take care of women.
0.0	1.13147309261e-08	No.
0.0	1.43121874965e-13	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	4.5052224655e-05	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.995877739381	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.999367066441	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	1.0	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.

0.0	4.58500162451e-10	My point is this.
0.0	0.99999529182	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	6.55356972535e-11	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	6.60859095489e-11	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.

0.0	1.40984422899e-05	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.000170701254945	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.

0.0	0.031571473809	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.

0.0	9.4817633406e-12	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.000968839664433	It's not that hard.
0.0	1.67137635967e-13	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	3.34643922092e-12	Yes.
0.0	0.999693897326	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	6.01383255904e-14	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.0157764132667	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.724503492057	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.00818063677605	You don't have to.

0.0	1.0	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	1.16800745786e-16	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.

0.0	2.18969761242e-14	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.0534513969992	I said no.
0.0	0.999996990805	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.650380616427	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	6.11975057587e-07	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.858335500702	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	4.94135351072e-13	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	2.5650077464e-10	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	1.02963894905e-09	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	8.38307959566e-07	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.999999999999	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	3.42203642015e-09	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	2.04907599101e-18	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.0150859157488	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.999999999603	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.998869207974	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	1.0	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.428671378884	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.0002633682523	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.98718091559	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	3.74185789192e-12	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	1.0	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	3.57610605186e-14	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.

0.0	1.0	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.

0.0	2.1437751296e-05	We need to reverse that.
0.0	1.47735242917e-07	We're going to cut costs.

1.0	1.0	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.999999760513	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.00426686500614	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.999999999987	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.

0.0	0.187246776636	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.998334283662	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	2.05346554097e-06	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	1.0	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.999914491178	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.999989061748	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.997441333524	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.999999649351	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.995148124307	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.000607171835691	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.995820265691	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	3.41799697496e-15	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	1.40360885693e-12	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	6.74176401422e-11	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	7.94993166312e-07	I know how to do that.

0.0	2.11839911189e-10	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.521892646101	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	9.69682972604e-08	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.000409720441922	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	1.46811190476e-16	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.999951924205	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.999999949467	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	2.50929026036e-23	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.999623971965	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.978798510401	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.484514909084	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.00668046360507	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.302533715874	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.0667882471162	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.42583049527	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	3.59363097267e-23	They do whatever what they do, OK.

0.0	0.972005690479	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	7.60061260271e-09	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	1.0	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	4.9510689269e-15	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	2.95989832184e-16	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	1.8070073169e-24	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	1.52943968543e-15	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.00314355117994	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.491262015282	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.276735158949	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.999999999942	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	1.13681215093e-10	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.998600546029	I know every one.
0.0	5.55525592378e-08	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.000266837967386	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.998713611402	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	1.92726666817e-23	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	1.34798497792e-08	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	1.6999680859e-06	And how do I know it?
0.0	4.54293288597e-08	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	2.95057433066e-11	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.874947545093	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	2.00030929678e-43	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	1.21667073924e-09	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.861198249241	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.0352023391722	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
1.0	6.56847949114e-08	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	1.37988577312e-06	It's their money.
0.0	1.95407867868e-10	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.999999999986	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	7.98455081436e-05	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	2.54189340261e-05	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.61126448108	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.305575744387	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	1.03947749222e-11	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.977826623635	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	2.05034185652e-08	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	1.58146398721e-20	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	1.38632213954e-08	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	6.23588201474e-09	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.999936031586	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.000201206227178	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	4.20287580188e-11	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.864783635628	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	9.92958025777e-14	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	3.98352509453e-08	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.000374893612974	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.000423590693481	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.892843145196	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.603618076717	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.00219726021387	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	2.0671684693e-07	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.999991266746	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.196338083785	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	3.37321050952e-12	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.979679283582	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.999981373555	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	3.27862272805e-06	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.999999377028	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.0150151656284	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	1.0	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	1.06853559038e-07	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.0535641745342	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.398862324433	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
1.0	0.999999999998	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.985686978661	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	1.07228491157e-22	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	3.43238470813e-32	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.0041501794791	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.

0.0	0.0352064221513	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.989506648208	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	1.0	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	1.23256766868e-31	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.

0.0	1.02167965961e-08	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.0830089914592	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.999999999909	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	9.62512243958e-05	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.999999999945	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.000129077172668	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.459600574568	You want to talk about moral authority.

0.0	0.842764870986	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	4.75889206584e-07	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.986166373505	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	1.38395511999e-15	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	6.07004397421e-11	Well, sure.
0.0	1.0	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	5.44097669875e-14	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	5.81723200521e-07	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.908220274286	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.

0.0	5.07114388497e-05	Ever.

0.0	0.0227112383356	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.000283023703488	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.999999248829	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.00111483600377	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.999999999999	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.986323588658	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.999999060278	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	1.92611183971e-14	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	1.73590688704e-09	No, John.
0.0	4.88110551825e-11	I don't care.

0.0	2.59367420345e-25	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.999985915583	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.990169451701	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.21261751982	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.999999968538	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.0035203365634	We don't win.
0.0	0.00104613725384	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.824919513782	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	7.54166562561e-26	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.000104924622612	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.000145723811783	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.

0.0	1.13147309261e-08	No.
0.0	0.461563748589	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.999992502621	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.582930646494	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.000205169903447	Illegal.
0.0	2.4740257522e-07	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.888353523191	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	8.49013643633e-06	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.995392628202	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.999999997502	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	8.89720507637e-23	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	4.20078767316e-05	Carly Fiorina.

0.0	0.00340457164045	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	1.92317895092e-06	I saw them come down.
0.0	2.98858493074e-07	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.994296871914	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.968221224889	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.84189393273	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.00138090817434	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.999999997317	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	3.28845943398e-20	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.999999990125	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.

0.0	6.88449590326e-09	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.000615757286589	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.955671193482	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	2.13191834076e-12	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.999845762981	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.00976422776253	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	6.92842996921e-05	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	1.26338997806e-06	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.999991128144	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.909866882127	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.000284153936685	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.0104914938174	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.00141685796888	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	1.0	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.999996123944	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	7.62181589708e-07	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.352890496082	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	1.468918293e-08	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	5.59454297575e-06	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.99999998277	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	1.0	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	1.94459421902e-14	This is the fantasy...
0.0	1.79998141274e-10	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.07196240372	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.999999947546	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.999707297414	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.705421349145	She was right.
0.0	1.45716959758e-10	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	1.0	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	6.17111333295e-07	I will be that new leader.
0.0	7.13139740054e-40	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	7.47766526427e-10	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.999999999995	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	7.62797526251e-07	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	2.34461386277e-30	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	1.70331026752e-11	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.86728939333	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.00490164328109	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.702086165677	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.00894718336207	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	3.83254580534e-07	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	2.6740965138e-13	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.999824580731	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.777909562478	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	2.90005701177e-09	This is a great nation.
0.0	5.0750682492e-11	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.999999653669	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	8.82908087348e-10	I totally get that.
1.0	0.999999999998	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	3.86115963199e-32	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
1.0	0.999999996046	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.999240392921	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	1.6746779157e-11	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.0019213361265	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.

0.0	0.999984654571	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	1.09724969326e-08	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	1.11768357326e-19	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.359444936139	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	3.48344169855e-08	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	4.41152892955e-18	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.00737634643922	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.594331747817	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	2.09902816629e-07	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	8.57295403778e-06	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.999999986518	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.0860095244608	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.999145768299	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	1.08955019011e-10	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.999739564546	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.801894831119	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.999107227849	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	1.94519251609e-09	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	2.14928673426e-07	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.971470867541	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.709130613249	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.

0.0	0.999897144559	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	3.5018157631e-10	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	8.20957995297e-05	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	2.70773808182e-09	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.0273955819576	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.00316810199983	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.179454734798	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.939392561814	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	1.0	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.220358323203	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.999758952676	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.000150534946824	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
1.0	1.0	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	1.0	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.980967230232	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.000633542868001	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
1.0	0.999975729234	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.999988138771	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	5.07114388497e-05	Right.

0.0	1.35692840483e-06	About Medicare?
0.0	0.999999243085	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.431722045659	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	1.19518648801e-11	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	2.06384277627e-25	The answer is no.
0.0	0.999999999111	I never said that.
0.0	0.999999944289	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.999995865039	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.0378850327656	Folks, you want to --

0.0	0.901776779126	He was on the board.
0.0	3.06879891436e-15	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.611000696446	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	5.24270728865e-08	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.295836115004	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.00656977627154	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.998389550667	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.999966524091	But we're not gambling.
0.0	3.18675978936e-08	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	3.33332835365e-31	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	1.0	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.

0.0	0.000672840770608	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.999912447743	I looked at the evidence.

0.0	2.44296979919e-21	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.

0.0	0.913632719944	Can I just add one very quick thing?

0.0	0.135192094349	It's driving up stock prices.

0.0	1.13007984061e-14	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.

0.0	1.78006292882e-08	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	9.37088466397e-19	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	3.14338551459e-18	You have to have certainty.

0.0	0.00177286752819	Thank you.
0.0	0.999687875402	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.190975311505	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	1.54848363777e-12	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	4.01512757143e-09	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	1.56456699987e-08	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	7.26118146072e-08	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	8.11023522804e-12	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	8.03212759965e-12	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	3.08786625082e-17	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.999925897704	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	2.20114512784e-05	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.

0.0	0.999867857676	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.000380660098381	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	1.23658886316e-06	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	5.47989067359e-07	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	6.07720016411e-34	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	1.63998076886e-08	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.0914457314794	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	1.11332784984e-10	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	3.83976705065e-22	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.999901370926	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.99501159382	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.999999999999	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	1.61622078964e-19	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	6.0347204263e-08	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.989144397259	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	1.0	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	1.45071214448e-18	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.000909330324874	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	5.16414175957e-18	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	4.22562611874e-26	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.988943167387	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
1.0	0.887225279277	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	3.57473368829e-06	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	1.86111779152e-20	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.99999999998	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.999999992989	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	4.4714808821e-19	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	5.3102132167e-06	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.999936837104	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.999996436468	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	1.03176650021e-15	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.00572297940912	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	1.12873451201e-07	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.999999999668	Of course you are right.
0.0	9.07462560449e-15	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	5.96216924711e-12	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	6.53607430877e-06	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.99977065616	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.99998808657	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.00851532315362	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.0256861316456	He's wrong.
0.0	5.97935721845e-16	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	1.7712569974e-35	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.687700645634	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	9.8164091257e-30	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	6.47352484162e-24	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	1.36802749594e-19	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.999999772543	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	1.0	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	6.02431366802e-07	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	1.35049310006e-10	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.898369525622	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.895135166025	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.959330152955	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.000331202309566	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.999998764705	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.00320009050132	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.0959250197797	And we are not England.
0.0	1.17799616635e-19	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	1.22850918816e-07	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	2.05963171746e-12	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	3.28864202969e-12	in particular.
0.0	0.00341437325453	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.984781815087	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	1.12307516344e-08	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	5.8459784897e-14	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	3.90680032764e-14	I'm looking out for the American worker.

0.0	2.72258681264e-10	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.000746959285554	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.999999091045	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	4.8985621187e-07	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	4.04456676014e-06	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	2.22154758095e-14	What should we do?
0.0	0.994332712836	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	1.6312193231e-13	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.943532094814	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	4.21086313756e-19	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	4.92092941587e-05	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	2.27111588106e-22	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	9.90842419185e-10	QUICK: Governor, thank you.

0.0	0.999999996151	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	2.52798785243e-09	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	1.51563950862e-19	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	2.25544805593e-10	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	7.53153613302e-10	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.999999999996	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.999996318575	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.999772339209	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.999649794526	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.966181448917	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.

0.0	5.02709440103e-06	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	9.40992240588e-30	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.999995367974	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.012721422188	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.

0.0	7.56828176881e-42	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	4.96001132686e-11	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	1.66801575941e-05	So we need to get on a different mindset.

0.0	3.16451414362e-27	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.999999999989	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	1.96229053013e-27	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.788123797024	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.

0.0	1.47504657958e-15	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	1.21222438521e-06	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.99999997772	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	3.18437141127e-09	You know that.
0.0	1.43720208564e-13	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.00073505045776	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	7.27791343567e-08	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	6.59488427676e-07	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.999981485597	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.000265001355573	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.362404253818	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.947431121735	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	3.82906969066e-06	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.00991394200101	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.999942120989	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	3.16425440875e-19	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	3.74900425602e-18	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	4.19053252239e-06	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	1.1064146021e-26	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.

0.0	0.999965859227	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.849527821982	This was a question on entitlements.

0.0	0.999999999998	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	2.0005033018e-23	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.00177286752819	Thank you.

0.0	0.0402992983846	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.999999940978	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.99117446761	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.468349848766	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.0921512514125	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	1.51493736029e-11	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.999973304224	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.828927846635	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.996857845421	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.984148624773	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	1.01506175852e-32	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.669138533533	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	2.94733902423e-12	It's not working.
0.0	1.45153603256e-05	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	3.25026814375e-08	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	1.40518233206e-10	Again...
0.0	0.497600862575	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	3.34643922092e-12	OK.
0.0	1.5790160787e-07	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.999999937215	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	1.25171756315e-20	I mean, you know...
0.0	8.43159371436e-05	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.000231093031761	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.00540455508168	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	5.33892776295e-06	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.997638362562	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.99502768922	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	1.75867163144e-20	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.998296914666	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	1.41527336308e-44	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.0404396007741	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.999350208374	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	9.90243182976e-05	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.419076514908	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	3.00840834963e-10	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.272029851431	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.631207091908	This is 2016.
0.0	4.82538316699e-13	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	1.16302150941e-07	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.998097922101	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.999999832313	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.938986873398	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	8.54135620485e-10	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	2.87891323914e-05	That's not true.
0.0	3.3540986361e-05	Creativity.
0.0	0.000696575958055	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	1.80018734189e-07	We put in place child care support.
1.0	0.999999000675	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	1.50435328923e-09	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	1.25360824204e-15	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.000113880625919	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	4.63189893218e-08	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	2.34666824158e-16	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.999999915643	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.0232222382079	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.999972271757	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.997696417529	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.99994860433	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.903670842363	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	1.40518233206e-10	So...
0.0	0.998391258085	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	8.95643622338e-14	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.930650597528	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.992670942285	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.348349096087	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	6.4791981272e-50	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.999995949042	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.999972131222	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.700338371737	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	6.83521330327e-21	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
1.0	1.0	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.22684833302	Well, I did.
0.0	1.48568035313e-15	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	6.56294994145e-11	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.0133447887925	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.9999890751	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	3.04349231219e-11	Check it out.
0.0	8.69456879765e-13	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	6.24885836978e-05	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.00404878372478	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	4.82092847132e-05	No, you did.
0.0	2.6465850177e-12	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.999999996374	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.996029893863	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.121744136184	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.000286402016314	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	1.98627488671e-13	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
1.0	0.0194316117053	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.999999999679	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	7.61153495341e-10	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	2.26837822589e-09	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	7.49393270894e-30	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	5.32814819871e-07	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.999999985802	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	2.9511391825e-05	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
1.0	0.999574969323	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	2.98616485325e-11	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	9.14786324537e-16	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.13982964127	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	2.23003323605e-14	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	4.49048809405e-05	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.999986564867	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	1.0	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	1.28087783352e-09	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	7.81107686898e-11	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.000396593242434	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.00503550241287	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.855791952459	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	3.41722673705e-13	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	3.85443271787e-11	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	3.82308904316e-11	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.000841561241713	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	1.19169344443e-17	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.000764298556416	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
1.0	0.987046350058	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	1.12833280463e-08	If I could just respond.
0.0	2.52830481109e-14	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	1.0	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.98077584666	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.990358605446	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	8.59258364596e-17	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	9.46596991422e-11	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.999999995042	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	1.89104781701e-19	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.995613776984	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.999679890737	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.999985805538	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.999999999532	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	8.43927914146e-14	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.0154689973513	They go to Princeton.
0.0	1.03180588912e-16	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	4.12987386862e-17	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	3.63451657362e-17	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.00627651663947	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	1.01710785008e-06	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	1.23150872261e-06	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.99307165133	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	2.71336076062e-15	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.999999999985	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.999999454381	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	1.0	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	6.65672839661e-11	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	1.15817968263e-15	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.999129937471	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.986088953303	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	5.95258480931e-07	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.999998311231	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	8.74702384786e-07	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	1.69066950297e-20	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.0853968889807	You know why three?
0.0	0.999999976526	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	3.80781578935e-10	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	4.3053698324e-06	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.999999993677	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.09462632831	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	4.62145487895e-16	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	1.61174832487e-07	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.0427927388101	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	4.2231979348e-05	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	7.39751991269e-08	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.999998376086	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.987165620097	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.00442720750183	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.847547803611	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.972047094231	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.997600135233	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.0146998937409	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	1.07000456736e-05	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.981472677209	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.000776077997444	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	2.07497832902e-06	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	4.23497500985e-12	But...
0.0	1.10125258994e-05	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.999989756954	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	1.11844868042e-11	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	2.14516804465e-16	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.17324015002	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	4.06340829802e-08	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.995370018118	You have to lead.
0.0	0.803314529884	That never works.
0.0	0.993035900968	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.00738067648156	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.754932244836	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.0374090707307	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	1.04415267906e-06	Say again?
0.0	0.000499611143136	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.00177286752819	Thank you.
0.0	4.11374997671e-26	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	8.82852135185e-12	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	3.65490980711e-05	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.898445281211	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	2.6444536037e-16	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.00895028301926	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	1.04922199921e-09	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.999965479714	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.00144456960573	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.999947631854	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.984373346138	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	3.55562434265e-12	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	6.87151253113e-08	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	4.27349727619e-13	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	1.4365737304e-05	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.999890075102	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	1.58090925036e-09	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.600145223409	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	3.13928306153e-09	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.200196426826	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.999913099061	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.998737928766	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	3.05726989743e-15	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.0027470404913	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.999999999948	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.990633657415	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	3.73293936789e-24	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	7.25562112762e-20	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.999999992277	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.747818813021	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	1.02302866866e-17	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	2.64002671483e-11	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	4.48721574588e-16	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.0477882569022	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.0385669276279	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	6.67671522216e-05	Our next president...
0.0	2.47170382688e-14	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	2.02142499117e-06	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	1.40258713444e-28	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	3.82147251179e-09	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.999990081534	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	1.13147309261e-08	No.
0.0	5.07721702353e-05	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.999999869459	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.98475924635	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	5.01026997929e-16	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.599505565441	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	1.0	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	3.57834236099e-07	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	2.87009825238e-37	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	9.90584287807e-05	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.000645887146077	You looking at me?
0.0	1.82474588317e-09	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.968273004522	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	2.19430419157e-07	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	1.24120337098e-21	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.00140966383975	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	2.53034079632e-06	Can we stop?
0.0	0.999993401956	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.999993965968	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	8.9298082701e-12	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	1.10683779212e-07	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	1.13147309261e-08	No.
0.0	2.64340666271e-16	You know why?
0.0	6.78630992247e-15	...
0.0	3.10473652497e-14	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	1.0	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.0625959970684	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	3.1077347887e-12	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.999999999969	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.999999816113	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	2.08475094462e-13	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	2.65339560429e-06	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.0272268754518	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	5.7647777168e-07	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	7.34727953791e-08	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.86950377228	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.00107107024248	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	1.23855266777e-11	Not keeping the government open.
1.0	0.999999999998	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.999999999999	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	6.14555852351e-12	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	1.23094384367e-11	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.593312402111	We are not France.
0.0	1.38386541706e-11	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	8.85246526311e-17	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.999999845703	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	1.2838623374e-06	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.000126986779775	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.999680461159	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	3.47328084986e-22	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.999999997784	We're running surpluses.
0.0	1.13720706965e-19	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	1.19075966126e-18	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.999985088149	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.230928479471	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.000101348313329	No, it's your record.
0.0	7.87203514679e-07	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.755959119354	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	3.50978285725e-11	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.804292277774	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.00164125959408	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.000163554564482	That's my bill.
0.0	1.03018172618e-06	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	4.54268091186e-17	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	8.57406094226e-09	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.9999999992	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.995846322432	...in the world for people...
0.0	6.78960880165e-07	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	4.20960619359e-18	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.000390531571114	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	9.40773932654e-11	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.720010972885	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.951277514064	He is not the only one.
0.0	6.94400949132e-06	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	3.1391460938e-14	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.999999824164	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.999997666103	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	8.2284233477e-33	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	1.18110628492e-10	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.999778334694	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
1.0	0.999999949457	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	2.95909625791e-13	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.999953395699	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.999969348975	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	3.44324535433e-12	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.554346269578	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	2.39376001644e-09	I would also just say this.
0.0	1.13670320086e-12	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	3.3397587964e-16	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	2.35984097158e-27	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	2.917555577e-19	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.941634048205	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	2.02652931977e-22	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	2.15943861164e-48	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	1.06298595245e-48	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	1.38863716364e-16	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.307497552163	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.999899311103	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	1.0	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	6.22308540231e-06	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.000432314264434	It is a false choice.
0.0	1.20555203984e-16	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	2.19374675864e-05	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.346717530158	My background is different.
0.0	4.50893127026e-11	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.995612450944	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.999999929642	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	1.66582706825e-14	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.11071684215	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	2.00178565252e-15	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.094553171331	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	8.00628575177e-09	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.733349570403	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	5.79010744901e-27	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.999999999999	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.000471659432443	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	7.93153653892e-12	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.999918608501	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.000348231378925	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.0629493482256	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.997880911138	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	3.47860776765e-07	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	7.27197440858e-22	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.929331627437	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.999954707853	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	2.89747720662e-10	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	2.27566101576e-20	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.000250284417703	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	5.62286660278e-15	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	9.59851113138e-19	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	5.68344802729e-25	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.999999532131	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	3.23718090742e-10	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.989097282028	I promise.
0.0	3.53686931046e-17	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	1.56933304925e-08	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	2.69812122814e-34	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.995834931138	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	2.77050610626e-09	I love this country.
0.0	0.37686908823	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.999999981457	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.99994881396	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	2.98579710775e-23	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	1.03539159044e-09	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	5.16114726867e-08	That is important.
0.0	0.150878599016	That's was hard work.

0.0	0.998355857715	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	2.4728766702e-05	You bet they do.
0.0	0.00139718412001	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	1.81538889496e-17	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.999740375746	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	3.97620580674e-17	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	1.55760094374e-16	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	6.46643722091e-12	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	4.86939021584e-12	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	1.89934121204e-10	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
1.0	0.99514570171	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.

0.0	0.000929342429348	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.000140739943407	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	1.29316542878e-13	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	8.90096015013e-08	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.796264257398	He has never defended...
1.0	0.999999999748	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	1.33977579611e-15	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.0024066488278	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	1.0	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	6.13081839589e-06	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.

0.0	1.5259915144e-21	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.99998891857	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
1.0	1.0	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	5.73626628772e-06	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.999254530953	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	3.61077745315e-06	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	3.69966038558e-14	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	1.76789595161e-13	And you know what?
0.0	1.86945235872e-06	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	2.49554862807e-08	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.0247332271698	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	3.3068676963e-08	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	3.68902429133e-28	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.999999996873	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.113516826529	I would just say that...
0.0	0.105755693849	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.267582750332	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.998904682679	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	1.86481904023e-16	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.999985902517	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	9.95988824049e-12	I'll say this.
0.0	1.65300529361e-17	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.993739690574	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.999999999918	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.235987739335	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	7.0683127906e-07	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.000840296161442	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	4.45963434527e-22	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	3.21677320454e-07	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	8.11851684315e-11	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	3.34643922092e-12	Yes.
0.0	0.0208486669192	White people?
0.0	0.99949652181	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	1.0	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.0662971525342	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.0140953189448	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.999999999987	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.698080720586	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.127776473468	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.821894273078	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.981603885018	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.989506648208	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.999597612464	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.999941172698	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.999998460498	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	2.5754112843e-08	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.000198939490472	I will put a price tag.
0.0	2.06512766495e-11	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	1.0	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.00126783611062	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.159395934532	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.999993687437	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.999972397228	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.999999938706	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	6.05131936737e-11	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.192917053387	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.999037877516	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.848271951721	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	4.2403261605e-13	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	2.8741844364e-15	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	2.82954533004e-05	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.996509863355	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.00470754563821	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	2.23138114329e-07	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.501260759113	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.000568764354431	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	2.60062420188e-15	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	1.06097517932e-18	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	8.76321491145e-06	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.000267857389037	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.941732073134	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	8.16128165029e-15	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	6.89956670723e-13	I want security.
0.0	0.0059680913813	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.999999069525	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.93215449602	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	3.73775064566e-05	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.99997104148	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	3.69348598879e-07	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.219009484351	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.999999993555	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.999999834404	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	1.53102806999e-39	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	4.00131898943e-18	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
1.0	0.999999933337	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.0949826564572	A terrible sight.
0.0	7.45835923836e-08	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.961976803006	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	7.36189860847e-10	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.998132480169	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	4.83896776514e-11	You find me...
0.0	2.27119716053e-08	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	2.66888624437e-39	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.99998641605	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.000528011874647	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
1.0	0.000201853405119	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.00236950282946	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.999999999985	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.999999386375	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	5.18152225725e-05	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	2.05308536643e-40	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.999999998688	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
1.0	0.999999978305	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	8.47751015693e-10	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
1.0	0.988794645625	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	2.36893884072e-26	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	1.3736049357e-06	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.999886800023	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	4.98452706219e-12	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	1.0	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.0453346669571	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	6.76639414836e-09	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	3.34643922092e-12	Yes.
0.0	1.21229398092e-06	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.447044884268	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.995934538968	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
1.0	0.00688586220384	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	1.26229161863e-21	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	2.28459217531e-24	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	1.20905533931e-05	Do we still have values and principles?
1.0	0.998621298274	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	2.49489233648e-08	I can do that.
0.0	0.00016767049134	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.00469979660883	They're a scam.
0.0	0.988423443766	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.915407091291	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.216662118763	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.999999991668	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	7.12059213903e-09	How do I know this?
0.0	7.05494434421e-05	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	5.25874234668e-05	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	7.60528367722e-21	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	1.91774926155e-17	They are not perfect.

0.0	0.386810910264	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.154099329784	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.999975938716	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.987621157464	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	3.56942102125e-06	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	9.83483286229e-30	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.

0.0	0.9999999998	Of course, they would.
0.0	2.35416847909e-05	But here's the real key.
0.0	1.66499037738e-06	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
1.0	2.07895786026e-12	That's wrong.
0.0	0.997456255922	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.389008241968	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	5.61581276837e-08	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.99999888706	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.999974710206	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	1.14836655869e-06	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	5.02391309465e-08	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	1.0884234362e-12	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.0360726306981	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.996966778186	A lot of people have jumped in here.

0.0	0.992174407125	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.000865497143532	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.596412839507	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	1.0	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.00957900966692	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	4.03470633376e-08	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	5.20469586096e-12	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	2.34211418186e-19	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	9.90219929042e-14	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.999998965258	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	7.04389322515e-08	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	8.65802909888e-06	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.0231435877289	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.999999999999	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.0309139640909	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	1.23184299871e-12	Think about that.
0.0	3.2211360974e-17	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.999997644452	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.999997513113	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.988431471348	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.

1.0	0.0176733768949	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	3.92358749481e-08	...10% flat rate...
0.0	1.30037428321e-05	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.000118054177426	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	6.66708128487e-10	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	3.54529848204e-21	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.999999999899	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.

0.0	0.999072805012	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	4.00646028734e-12	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.0010634130364	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	5.48725099859e-06	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.

0.0	9.89637177196e-16	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.9986773301	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.

0.0	0.00177286752819	Thank you.
0.0	0.999999999111	I never said that.
0.0	2.07744591565e-26	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.999970307812	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.000147995116918	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.

0.0	7.73680704613e-10	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	3.43022675145e-20	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	1.53629661686e-11	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.0548886586808	Growth is the answer.

0.0	1.39222514384e-05	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	2.0455855321e-06	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	9.20635684299e-06	This country is changing.
0.0	2.29467898545e-11	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.00145927221783	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	1.76789595161e-13	And you know what?
0.0	8.65662240991e-09	They're off to China.
0.0	0.999972915909	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	2.89869996247e-08	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	1.0	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.

0.0	8.40038144572e-10	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.99976252226	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	1.23231509303e-14	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	9.08359853612e-07	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	4.42742631904e-05	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.

0.0	1.05262712432e-10	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.999505339767	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	2.16185911034e-18	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.0170637026571	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.

0.0	3.22990046519e-06	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.000120255098307	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.999999807993	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.00016245915583	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.934375165124	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	4.34677633456e-16	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.999997880209	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	7.76718235206e-09	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	7.43252542641e-10	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	2.64227982613e-06	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.106730294735	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.999999487406	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.248094105069	They're Muslim.
0.0	1.16954682646e-21	Wait for what?
0.0	4.46670811547e-07	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.00177286752819	Thank you.
0.0	0.28387467209	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	3.4281435719e-16	These...
0.0	0.714496787872	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	1.35552248208e-08	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	4.0187051759e-18	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.205761650859	...before I go.
0.0	8.12916206654e-06	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.810821371863	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.999907088819	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.999999778599	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.00301738616	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.840345028579	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.998982565988	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.960164379411	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.999143253889	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	2.86120586489e-10	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.689728634048	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.653673980155	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.100231097824	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	1.29582536489e-07	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	1.07010717125e-17	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.999999999997	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	9.15467168518e-19	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	1.13759530686e-25	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.89475113886	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	1.51071711349e-39	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
1.0	0.999999481748	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	1.0	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	5.71699593235e-17	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	1.00915369457e-26	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	1.0	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	6.78630992247e-15	...
0.0	0.998812877301	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.999999983785	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.0630907909174	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	1.0	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.999999999602	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	3.91611773397e-05	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	6.78630992247e-15	...
0.0	1.88388139825e-17	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.423775175021	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	3.03407334752e-20	But look...
0.0	1.57743980936e-18	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.999997171171	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.677686816755	Here's the problem.
0.0	2.13056817119e-10	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.99985866631	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.949265652671	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	4.11355547871e-11	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	1.0	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	1.0	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.0213148006814	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	1.56098805769e-06	We can't do it.
0.0	0.000200740427196	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.0207649330518	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.0122767576935	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	5.31444726151e-11	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	1.91340258275e-07	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	2.45028728648e-09	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.000391180414464	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.999999596423	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	1.16011406857e-14	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.0381380245484	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	3.34643922092e-12	OK.
0.0	5.4520822643e-46	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	6.46089384735e-10	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.999873242404	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.964288456877	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	1.60009468235e-08	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.993553106814	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.00838788512205	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.896753509076	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	3.81645028401e-08	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.189006484358	I have.
0.0	1.69225257825e-28	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.99530457508	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.00113013305572	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.999997644452	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.00101262229117	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	1.77484328935e-14	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	5.56499127768e-11	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.999999999934	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	1.76789595161e-13	And you know what?
0.0	2.12304280001e-12	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.757177199074	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.0199184304939	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	8.46777754245e-15	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.83538974755	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.278988457778	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	6.34687738399e-10	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	5.74072769093e-08	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.000643419456954	We're against your policies.
0.0	2.02024892117e-12	Or somebody else.
0.0	3.11490742652e-15	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.163743839314	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	2.16703283196e-05	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	7.33288866655e-18	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	5.08810034208e-05	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.999905004398	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.999982669704	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.99987657942	He does great.
0.0	1.87904750232e-05	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.00069931140261	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	4.68926760237e-14	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.960153140647	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.00137776857388	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	2.51539142968e-12	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	7.69262023047e-12	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.748673420405	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	3.79370772589e-11	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.000265989065899	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.000134098467611	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.909704872708	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.244647331907	Let me tell you how that question...

0.0	1.81173766896e-17	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.

0.0	0.99999999997	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.

1.0	1.0	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.999398253888	The big Internet companies.
0.0	5.69736338664e-07	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.975378247518	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	2.16299288859e-12	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.0206954598083	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	1.72733455161e-17	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.698340873118	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.110891005279	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	2.23626601226e-16	But, I would also add this.
0.0	2.6060786548e-12	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.999982861222	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	8.0186749127e-09	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.999999983047	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.992653296544	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	1.0	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	2.55024849406e-13	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.825908453888	That's exactly what we saw.
