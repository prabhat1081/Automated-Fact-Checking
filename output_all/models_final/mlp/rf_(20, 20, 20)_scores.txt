0.0	0.893704983764	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.925903160746	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.0011280238042	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.000179970729308	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.0386212281997	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.950462965386	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.

0.0	0.997325915766	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.423313382333	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	5.25066663483e-07	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.325208676793	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.00141918284358	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.908155730202	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.112944511141	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.00113435181258	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.00195329475295	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	7.47562357378e-12	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.969244262593	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.

0.0	4.64376874255e-07	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.993670886056	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.847502869362	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	5.15647117832e-07	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.518175167002	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.134398417896	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.825292288153	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.362997751299	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.184196718706	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.983457856917	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
1.0	0.991437401402	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.420410134146	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.886576225079	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.561752359791	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.567156383604	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	7.34665265372e-14	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	2.71037589995e-07	OK, good.
0.0	0.473201953503	That's fine.
0.0	0.00776868719081	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.0516951605397	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	5.44395512979e-09	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.433601601247	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.500445873207	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.622627838918	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.779144731943	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	2.55325256887e-06	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.0009479323635	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.0361402078061	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	5.46650349469e-05	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.00774481067005	Right.
0.0	0.00679255725677	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.44110098573	Here's the thing.
0.0	6.43319015338e-12	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.213256256151	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.0355819204226	And so do I.
0.0	0.945998532537	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.0126669530065	We're running.
0.0	0.840821776166	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.99634248478	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	6.86198917645e-05	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.999009039475	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.00548770440824	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.000515914680063	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.947612413634	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.0099827219595	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.000111228255392	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.795625878104	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.019653482934	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	5.46747793483e-13	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	7.34872671021e-21	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
1.0	0.723789076717	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.687942318489	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	1.60554991845e-10	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.631286381687	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.799306768587	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.00213274334301	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.940440131097	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.00466279098824	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.46981075076	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.00270479474133	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	8.1093409495e-15	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	2.53381473102e-08	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	3.28266048503e-11	And who can blame them?
0.0	5.59547982201e-09	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.999027484724	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.724269347633	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.00451907767463	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.02664619309	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.392989263955	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.997916426401	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.759471558	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.47210500733	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.0512703035276	We have no borders.
0.0	0.000236646290557	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.000158798158378	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.694472358824	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.951147780552	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.71203091957	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.00248278972308	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	8.66422246009e-20	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.0169357925055	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.00165733236366	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.102288760242	I was the architect.
0.0	0.759098130759	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	1.77356392672e-06	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
1.0	0.889390512409	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.0048556348242	...
0.0	0.221134639439	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.311331469184	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	3.39530666679e-09	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
1.0	0.984578648211	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.00113357376145	Thank you.
0.0	0.928988528135	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.000501772400802	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.000394212645439	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.621951102175	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.857332807883	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.812628876436	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.47342632318	I've done it.
0.0	0.981519038483	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.0648433571734	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.00161405108458	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.634494295465	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.000472448733702	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	1.38714854017e-10	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.973885769698	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.318279758718	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	1.00274607835e-10	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	2.76277156422e-05	I think you're --
0.0	0.00774481067005	Right.
0.0	0.968818073372	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.00372457991584	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.671990712518	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.0666137144527	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.00348656535521	I love this country.
0.0	0.00983320101096	You get together.
0.0	0.638266438213	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.0073566868674	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.0325431480522	You don't have to.
0.0	3.7675416314e-07	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.945757220565	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	6.37020424565e-10	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.92861617189	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.982443166269	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?

0.0	0.0898488505385	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.

0.0	0.421089745753	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.65979580446	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.000328461237059	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.522784872439	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.838115054786	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.584569823296	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	3.15314223448e-09	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.

0.0	0.359159562888	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.951465335283	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.000442107831438	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.110372698338	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	4.18588257172e-08	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	1.2511828023e-14	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.955134561577	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.149783465879	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.754353152204	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.

0.0	8.88886142427e-05	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.0324802317915	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.00580322535284	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.70466934412	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
1.0	0.00224766728317	That's wrong.
0.0	0.579265928312	That never works.
0.0	0.506621971316	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.0133184834306	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	9.87765586518e-13	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.820331255285	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.583741197355	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.665116704859	That's what I said.
0.0	0.837637742703	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.956085547968	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.979243588802	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.000465626364413	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	4.93831584866e-11	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.00240667945588	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.0172677395516	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.980490352815	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.726416662958	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.553664142216	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.512812176269	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.241349991425	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.958736096599	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.168743146133	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	2.74495216139e-07	We will make America great again.
0.0	5.10124282221e-11	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.00340602559762	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.850708453018	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.812844990685	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.0314501509932	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.62853520975	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.428797235415	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.569883005098	I got that.

0.0	0.784865243879	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	9.67357794497e-10	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.0253060379734	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.519077443218	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.178202476438	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.094652318715	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.00370198977976	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.0731811248179	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.85221644704	The world has changed.

0.0	0.833860329546	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.224165043247	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.856213042398	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.558551058449	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.959166947527	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.799868031733	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.810987565522	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	5.39326753023e-06	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.0694901739542	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.872634507713	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.21121647234	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
1.0	0.548706053959	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.43782511243	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	5.32574168608e-05	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.959998351986	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.0137539525601	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.263301771241	Both served.
0.0	0.0366516219157	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.000761433473688	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	1.04850169316e-05	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.678648080353	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.000353062021438	We need sound money.
0.0	0.823143178867	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.965118152644	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.267970334973	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.705233813664	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.400848355564	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.411135366619	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.038051545049	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.556926914167	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.568151928796	I didn't.
0.0	0.591858701091	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.0333560917583	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.148300205308	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.0484839217882	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.840740123151	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	8.56864913983e-11	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	6.13497803124e-12	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.

0.0	0.00108018581841	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.000948749726151	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.234060858705	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.000756732052684	Again...
0.0	0.610948020716	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.25966870993	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.000101390139836	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.0917788076806	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.929368347922	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.768815205683	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.999884398156	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.761382018832	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.905633666037	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.136600278718	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.00799779317828	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.000529915755297	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.782053369719	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.000873849299215	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.726935899768	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.958729650336	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.552325780497	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.988928395581	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	1.75603903195e-08	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	1.81207119706e-08	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.870080927654	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	7.654282549e-05	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.854546007868	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	9.34316398738e-06	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.0173991669369	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.150913419955	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.00118946956169	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.84653011198	The guns don't pull the trigger.
1.0	0.985871451139	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	1.96807830154e-08	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.0339772232425	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.985697189164	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.010628951178	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.0059109927443	Not bad.
0.0	0.684177070998	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.964480217282	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	1.00592796271e-13	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.937010288481	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.325123782501	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.00205800116717	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.972512306056	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.788523726733	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.0101407935396	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	1.06960305419e-07	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.129406652929	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.444850321054	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.0213641987617	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	3.51556285295e-07	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.590329502252	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.876438780263	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.859793977492	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.00100517999134	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	2.36800554329e-07	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.88758335412	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.000112631743467	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.000261764285614	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	4.74165545705e-09	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	2.24617494031e-11	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
1.0	0.91349787866	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.200138616609	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.00525953494931	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.774171989002	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.2381253447	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	5.51911725305e-06	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	3.61318705734e-08	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.000396379945544	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.810734709551	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	9.78282554934e-06	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	6.14195012061e-05	No -- no...
0.0	0.808741562103	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	4.22557054991e-12	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.999006477608	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.982575897158	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.00713530139477	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.0147775889257	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	4.29051105383e-05	You know that.
0.0	0.00774481067005	Right.
0.0	0.948501889304	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.760424719311	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.00030192231478	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
1.0	0.46551122334	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.0208390881797	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.00774481067005	Ever.
0.0	2.77827798458e-19	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.52289453023	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	3.65121404638e-16	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.983636091038	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	1.17319910033e-05	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.0136637367444	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.723301559948	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.000235842077144	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.987364102011	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.774705944712	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.800711769272	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.328467809887	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.744342178242	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	5.18568530863e-13	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	5.31801631174e-08	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.809648470122	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.964358203283	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	9.71009302035e-08	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.0249311856218	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.98757232737	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
1.0	0.776875945493	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.931673876357	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.00189554472145	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.948620299125	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.843420977366	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.346006484051	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.773118082269	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.786230865467	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.731128001774	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.256719089982	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.483340813597	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.00126004636377	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.97189947733	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.00909689440817	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	4.18262582007e-05	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.98948397196	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.037185629686	We're friends.
0.0	0.00250532979705	But look...
0.0	0.0104238068998	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.207161409771	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	2.13758420281e-16	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.59055352507	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.881447265218	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.0033510123058	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.79692934031	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.545802687531	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.0534774946156	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.36125516201	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.960614124011	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.000117038587987	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.000282711411911	So you know what?
0.0	0.463397720242	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.000198965537684	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.799363786603	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	3.76011307445e-08	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.0485387917288	That's the difference.
0.0	0.708443676183	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.00082529245065	It's their money.
0.0	0.788423948876	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.507117139711	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.608941830992	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	2.06720557587e-18	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.899339510203	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.680331632662	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.0165900622338	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.000790972574295	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.258951848008	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.109201931043	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.567837463222	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.2767251795	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.0096696440002	I would just say that...
0.0	0.000154398796551	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.752397463645	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.00104397556855	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.00885428409152	John?
0.0	0.00797338863555	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.681412316122	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.961191593899	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.00375792512141	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.671442840289	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	5.35663671908e-10	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.877506947356	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	6.57747969377e-07	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.00813349644563	I like it.
0.0	0.0346258154139	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.015976448845	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.52324568486	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.858087270181	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	1.08065376162e-12	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
1.0	0.798111088053	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.0781440736015	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	3.97099482851e-18	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.0180273040928	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	1.06214934679e-13	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.000959324467635	See?
0.0	0.645683978572	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.856510823434	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.00200899775827	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	2.27367380883e-06	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.000253842328681	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	2.48453426632e-08	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.192326105003	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.975661244781	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.675755260195	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.706373096089	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	1.31164374086e-06	See, they don't like that.
0.0	2.48159240909e-05	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.304554535075	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.734845507764	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.000243439517553	Well, I respectfully disagree.

0.0	7.51284655394e-25	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.

0.0	0.00561354802768	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.791066588556	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.000153368964373	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.932938575112	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.0477331309228	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
1.0	0.0109389631171	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	1.85191296216e-13	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	3.18235963583e-06	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.754228790183	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.289654636357	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.319288039556	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	1.48012505103e-06	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.553347810467	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	2.9091580291e-07	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.412685261887	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	7.78125631809e-06	They don't like that.
0.0	0.00754639834498	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.0525761817097	Why didn't they call?
1.0	0.967203663587	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.00885428409152	Alright.
0.0	2.32219655202e-08	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.000156972627197	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.329667662659	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.00765231020084	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.752688985427	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.00175648362127	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.00171466825787	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.00227600009475	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	8.61019175686e-06	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.511705229257	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	3.45212777287e-06	We need to create jobs.
0.0	4.13506359427e-07	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.886036625687	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.000124062783678	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	4.27970024618e-05	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.0422980408169	They're a scam.
0.0	0.288576068112	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.843109281813	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.983150502904	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.951861164398	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.0205797950811	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.00156398877367	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	8.3459008856e-13	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.780557575632	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	1.10094136153e-16	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	1.53958677581e-05	That's my view.
0.0	0.997020011685	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.00271737016224	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.88327341885	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.000225149615847	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.889327461543	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	6.80135863663e-08	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.299626993076	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.999983227236	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.000375572171257	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.000331406837317	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.000923703933303	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.806784788828	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	3.04116500071e-06	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.7025855191	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.107364501105	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	4.22368455779e-05	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.39512736711	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.0100970404156	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.983867421932	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.943721082128	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.00356997352809	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.439314977715	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.0728992037107	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.877856551876	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.903484071244	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.00376907361927	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.280072201215	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	1.84411358549e-08	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.989466721013	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.376493051291	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.000991280206496	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.602733995336	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
1.0	0.998354609112	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	4.13780116745e-19	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
1.0	0.88544294412	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.999987588691	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.000113989056839	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.00320163003195	Why is that?
0.0	0.00498209132944	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	1.05867443017e-06	And why?
0.0	0.799129815868	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	1.41207774016e-09	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.339305022695	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.68590895495	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.8893858785	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.649876429181	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	2.26780462417e-06	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.705179022971	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.999667435446	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.888170347971	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.0262141789741	It goes away.
0.0	7.718128445e-08	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.922719013438	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.895092275339	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.000211857766393	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.908853759521	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.00756179721787	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.840859448695	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.871437717982	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.0015191699928	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	3.140454166e-07	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.00651797585112	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.0215429251558	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.974932885811	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	3.51676664569e-13	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.819806302712	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	6.97468486101e-10	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.0455017599503	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.844409833092	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.0440547775584	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.972805552109	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.940327429764	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.964113551796	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.85492691828	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.971275755697	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	5.84810580394e-05	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.104589889341	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.0865584033435	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	7.45012143736e-08	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.154025820767	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.875006944546	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.338030165375	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.182560227917	Well, the deal was done.
1.0	0.996900370504	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	7.98334670362e-09	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.482198618251	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.000643271589176	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.569762681875	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.00983320101096	We haven't.
0.0	0.995926861506	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.698571443566	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.308050442308	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.00169193662738	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	6.88776852282e-07	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.79436302544	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.000315854991852	That's what he is.
0.0	0.763702508785	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.978254131748	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.0115400860914	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.223758853791	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
1.0	0.991458151022	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.982763573016	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.0558519447209	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	9.81798993479e-09	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.0330663749106	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.580644555136	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
1.0	0.0541662297162	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	3.76512357824e-14	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.0360720317227	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.549806569859	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	6.33883107555e-06	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.651180130569	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.0136917021912	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.0456071956877	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.00256011618847	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.00136204662252	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.483805091336	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.738910820416	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.0207640537787	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.0340375905507	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.000648201182097	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	4.40668389548e-11	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	1.09281625581e-16	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.496490902374	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.0631659534615	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	1.37752555174e-05	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.910552383051	Two quick responses.
1.0	0.476926871159	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.948638543749	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.0312030791547	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.977035143915	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.650973554165	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.000250276114195	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.173408471003	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.000189723743651	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.602963947557	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.998094247721	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.867108728893	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	5.72193162781e-09	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.230664069748	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.00773073182922	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.308676903644	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.0010254862205	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.673000365124	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.0593753033871	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.926877272358	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	4.18946093418e-09	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	4.1171697577e-05	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
1.0	0.957120982414	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.896201219172	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.

0.0	0.97378707271	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	7.33811765436e-05	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.999986384716	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.968756998157	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.000241107442223	OK.
0.0	0.96936688178	I would change them.
0.0	0.350482140189	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.

0.0	0.489296211158	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.65910039728	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.00017194643253	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.529601777781	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.000828451805973	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.985495981106	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.195635783231	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.158226073784	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.00386816489893	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.731525146426	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	2.63933349077e-10	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.417839229273	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.975308745022	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.0104995302773	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.64346862763	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	6.03108933028e-06	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.96589252708	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.606739361918	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.842685423953	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.

0.0	0.843166547778	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.

0.0	0.000275977391711	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.00115053009333	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.00289102214567	I don't care.
0.0	0.805239769129	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.264171379775	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.994690560269	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.00133840116067	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.00198813381266	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.69995447331	She voted for it.
0.0	0.760709455905	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.929630775978	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.998821611316	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.298323053768	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.964603707665	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	1.77903932623e-07	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.924746438647	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	2.70031371034e-05	How great is that?
0.0	0.00284411548864	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	4.46740497923e-07	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.830804633142	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.0545696817524	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.651125946169	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.000547890924959	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.744619556685	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.0179687572163	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.110308512587	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	4.31902289325e-06	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.0687141411724	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.901098619209	Two points.
0.0	0.873433240737	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.

0.0	8.72786397443e-13	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	7.08829105669e-07	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	5.13129333299e-09	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.00134794755505	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.991745113427	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.0400571842347	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.773360686825	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.184152186849	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.775995871036	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.820507674383	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.879737872848	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.170425889389	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.986816709266	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.618642679933	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.000346321990838	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.0409801373579	We're not doing it.
0.0	2.95412013864e-06	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.00104253732463	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.00549080411828	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	3.06331093423e-09	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.120169119369	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.739020433226	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.764793857856	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.999303777899	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.144314939404	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.19466953138	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.697662695752	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.936933875044	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.670947739889	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0821287486467	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.172936067183	No vision at all.
0.0	0.938892168178	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.0878081307484	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.463317348987	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.0579807702366	A rich person does not.
0.0	2.970259867e-09	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.000186219278113	I understand.
0.0	0.450526218728	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.000325993228992	I love China.
0.0	0.0004843349046	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.480018823889	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	9.3519200164e-13	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.000292391879144	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.348783498346	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.00454026778947	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
1.0	0.706644886522	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	5.7346216203e-06	In all due respect...
0.0	1.01093011031e-12	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	1.12091608008e-11	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.953284056528	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	1.12276674748e-07	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.00418927250175	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.123391010561	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.579329810936	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.234679943923	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	1.04852135984e-08	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	2.64045020101e-08	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
1.0	0.970140190138	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.00615780756696	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	6.40790580913e-07	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.737162021373	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.877919115722	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	3.96215639893e-05	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.203227547614	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.656333478008	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.99681990126	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	5.20141520938e-05	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.0255866286426	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.700381800723	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.653874413061	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.987470218093	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.899105412646	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.681863392143	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.0500817554601	That is not right.
0.0	0.725847734536	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.677519005249	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.999550704289	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.781172719587	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.000347887635944	Our next president...
0.0	0.844370068846	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.861560305766	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.994892511478	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.381094928829	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.0500817554601	That's not right.
0.0	0.973405517034	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.00098815140232	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.0967249745351	You get the Congress.
0.0	3.45887429894e-05	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.94013917405	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.596529887896	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.000413479337147	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.924383898539	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.529713366805	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.651682300959	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	4.28097046217e-09	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.000488940099199	These...
0.0	0.172175297677	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.622522328856	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.963329432205	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.474779353919	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.953546127449	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	2.67955155306e-06	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.000605841930911	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.0669637984103	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.808916524993	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.978567173654	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.0599843341887	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.000647510165615	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.987456260353	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.744204383827	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.11889044229	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.000322762441031	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.990800556696	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	1.92813272447e-22	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.0237064335964	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.599911381157	And, we said no.
0.0	0.749164688694	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.908665045996	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	1.02550893701e-06	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	2.94667177214e-07	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.751403719691	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.0913091575269	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.968011669813	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.398080005111	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.261404644016	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.00252388741314	I have.
0.0	0.858071379695	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.00113049580851	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.845458556914	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	8.64432948208e-13	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.0662642443165	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.759281945834	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.

0.0	0.997253584921	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.00769206368084	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.46978679349	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	5.40264171238e-06	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.933526866678	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.000982978709355	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.473541317249	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.000740817029876	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.988486490349	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.163558511754	We used to win, we don't win anymore.

0.0	0.978411760237	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.97624448367	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.

0.0	1.50293243395e-09	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.0917138443459	We have Arab allies.

0.0	0.219719719901	It's extraordinarily wrong.

0.0	0.832041237109	There is a better way to provide health care.

0.0	0.966364498689	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	4.73730940962e-15	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	4.24226215284e-11	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.00227126639277	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.983272880094	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.

0.0	0.00113357376145	Thank you.
0.0	1.82358881444e-08	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.402914282121	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.591989055201	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.873462528258	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.

0.0	0.11428919935	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.75712817362	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.0229018822751	They pay tax once overseas.

0.0	0.14565600316	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.291035359229	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
1.0	0.909667872718	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.726255599999	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.163607921084	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.819771810315	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.875457799971	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.39512736711	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.0830353807392	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.0552563161261	I have no idea.
0.0	4.90478903368e-09	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.918544955445	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.998239489717	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.968003229213	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.978817293311	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	3.12835394021e-07	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.663297581375	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
1.0	0.999500594904	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	8.89665177673e-05	No, it's true.
0.0	0.519421733281	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.218993228699	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	3.91836490041e-06	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.65547894068	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	2.32043739541e-06	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.667045000617	I was not that candidate.
1.0	0.477319696252	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.202718789315	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	1.07966702769e-10	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.808343616678	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.820927334579	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.00113357376145	Thank you.
0.0	0.325018948083	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.212174319239	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.00614047087115	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.0859553739007	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.830233489751	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.750297489276	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.695112566671	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.000129601261271	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.897129961251	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.584178984381	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.349136596159	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.291222801968	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.932321958796	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.0119204317881	We didn't spend any.
0.0	1.11118995717e-09	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.813140273185	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.939688707991	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.842636742626	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.71075962192	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.991475898157	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.00148687023142	I can do that.
0.0	0.00515851572879	They're off to China.
0.0	0.462041634565	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	3.03506350043e-05	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.356298585552	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.0262141789741	It never happens.
0.0	0.353947504522	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	8.82201005086e-07	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.897776894694	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	3.23150529107e-10	And guess what?
0.0	0.834929459876	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.00947338690411	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.571114750222	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	8.501461796e-06	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.972514122605	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.00762171883099	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	8.43237026739e-06	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	1.20032680441e-11	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.987347332779	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.787184072905	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	2.82469442858e-05	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	3.27966552753e-09	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.00386944049642	No.
0.0	2.29058657296e-05	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.998781050061	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.443132542463	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.804615475146	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.596716555032	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.885940562105	I've got a track record.
0.0	1.10130852587e-11	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.523483639232	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.742316638193	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.624035858604	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
1.0	0.575999503907	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.00189953257027	And you know what?
0.0	0.000552893850332	That's good.
0.0	0.00731504674758	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.00954309622564	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.242083039843	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.0914927618027	Here's the problem.
0.0	1.76743564337e-05	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.0197675260119	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.836533916565	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.970677864872	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	4.33961296012e-10	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	4.15701482915e-07	That's what we need.
0.0	1.20473875677e-05	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.565277287858	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.412331885089	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	2.66714204399e-05	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.000564533394368	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.691385162646	I never said that.
1.0	0.980067825574	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.00157942360822	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.617661614715	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.0603882149163	You just want to...
0.0	0.0799953342436	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.102519061953	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.00434611301412	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.999042215424	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.0193589978126	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	2.96262768704e-07	That's what I'm working towards.
1.0	0.970759784227	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.00579584827414	No, no.
0.0	0.96252195081	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.

0.0	0.567672945872	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	1.540977778e-13	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.0924445680772	No accomplishment.
0.0	2.71372964766e-06	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.00493457443611	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.000524109823305	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.880430269822	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	3.63461144523e-14	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.968956188331	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.780780250116	But I was born here.
0.0	0.0968892634434	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	2.11266604189e-09	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.00189953257027	And you know what?
0.0	0.00280205859739	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.689524903662	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.859968963872	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	1.33301547166e-08	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.811259442221	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.543740229733	And here's the last piece...
0.0	4.58736453249e-08	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.000215204011234	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.973673254872	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.373870658797	You did.
0.0	4.50320582154e-06	This country is changing.
0.0	0.754156284413	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	1.05202748755e-07	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.406368300426	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.0256280421641	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.502808079305	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.163129638017	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.395674968686	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.0563420651063	Or somebody else.
0.0	2.26727776021e-09	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.903394993811	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.677823720244	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.005662915675	About Medicare?
0.0	0.776526257913	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.000225375277886	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	1.26247969109e-06	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.957545463924	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.902388668173	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.983901475127	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.753288568684	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.00068072179039	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.00134048680466	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1.0	0.684861882578	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.50702950985	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.56065411226	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.639000116619	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	1.17024910281e-21	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	4.46252908971e-18	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.000145523859895	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.726579050818	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.419652753419	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.00031359294958	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	2.41428072559e-05	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	1.44239672244e-05	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.99382471646	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	7.86069539645e-08	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	1.02771399166e-12	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.0365435590259	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.0170079449287	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	6.56874750922e-05	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.893984678616	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.89511568234	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.661573397116	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.451498593784	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.929243301541	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	4.0083129096e-06	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.962293987367	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.841584837566	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.99869905919	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.0166475036134	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.391399184108	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.992762716947	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.869580727442	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.209276155357	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.00143907777073	The answer is no.
0.0	4.09826977233e-12	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.402039151524	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.999474570917	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.586820414766	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	2.32372928035e-07	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	7.46144541696e-07	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.489365080402	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.425099541615	We're going to end up in the same place.
1.0	0.0444443115959	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.776742421531	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.00143010178431	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.872403287382	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.999584781753	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.945738931584	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	1.24039849015e-05	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	3.23512467155e-12	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.948959600489	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.00902865736813	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	8.31737728245e-06	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.000103967371231	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.381276332201	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.000110512873931	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.00632548520662	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.829282339856	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.000562089590811	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.994153398664	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.993708523888	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.0811478807297	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.474304563519	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	5.36154767311e-05	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.876151031232	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.0148268453686	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.197292201751	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.0344383360423	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.000593195006057	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	2.5590801014e-06	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.00078155927741	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.86972967867	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	3.26233820557e-07	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.102851406475	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.452643112705	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.736443001358	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.000843396377639	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	2.56273466453e-05	Take it to the bank.
0.0	1.47203221053e-08	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.689609845421	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.255789805194	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	5.56963201151e-05	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.1529879821	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.80978926625	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.767750588395	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.984964079045	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.00117573938285	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.976580958113	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.55120362291	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
1.0	0.967783516019	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.942087860477	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	8.17470656864e-05	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	5.3910365267e-06	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.000296407921537	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.00613884298186	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.964254570532	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.646071624198	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.357889431422	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.0114935071582	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	3.34406583258e-07	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	1.29792699056e-26	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.964871984311	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.98630710946	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.0777327047392	I want security.
0.0	0.0048556348242	...
0.0	6.31552923059e-06	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	1.33305304553e-10	...No, sir...
0.0	0.405473430504	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	8.45190733198e-16	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.56842510036	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.177112238143	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.873998108416	Of course you are right.
0.0	1.59178405835e-05	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.98155948018	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.204718187929	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.0145990645691	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.0202209640182	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.699430740822	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.399112542084	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.0262141789741	It never happens.
0.0	0.0130438576173	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.604408967535	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.849675790086	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.0048556348242	...
0.0	0.0726124926731	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.90658647462	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	4.22817838789e-12	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.978596743909	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.266959519939	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.956852380011	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.748703564837	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.0565729218209	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.730026045952	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.974054774951	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	5.32158442994e-09	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.259506625379	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.685729993628	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	8.90818987921e-07	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.0284234913068	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.983572398212	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	1.18012961938e-10	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.998696112093	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.0197973146532	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.00708771742645	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.378944555507	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	1.51880485598e-05	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.000217561355432	Well, I don't know.
1.0	0.930219972854	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.531075665676	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.000259547724958	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.768815205683	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.0923571849087	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	7.68163294692e-08	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.986625539897	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.000407709171569	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.740655219413	They were wrong.
0.0	0.78849052392	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.00412193235062	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
1.0	0.227735195894	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.666647410197	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.997756856914	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.843937890972	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.014914721105	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.994299549173	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.000846743799293	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.000133831513753	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.525187134634	We have to stand with them.
0.0	7.83697706864e-06	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.00100318315871	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.429297235361	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.999642013833	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.00032779424739	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
1.0	0.967836575926	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.00128529165186	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.490998223989	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.405086070792	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.927756590492	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.859864407933	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.962597380736	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.354215113235	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.843871556104	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.00682726301769	It is.
0.0	0.948989051478	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.00742586524897	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.00357728365497	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
1.0	0.644957238012	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.00189953257027	And you know what?
0.0	0.000870719558759	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.763523405781	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.752508224212	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.00325017501059	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	3.6446472728e-06	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.737424723195	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.0163727388856	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	4.08079028281e-05	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	3.3791507509e-08	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.869928474062	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.833482219859	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	8.9938805573e-05	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.711283121462	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.00589845708882	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.282538453823	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.58119948307	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.634209723849	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
1.0	0.901082636215	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.422896490076	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.39158990284	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.0308400414537	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	8.70184996401e-08	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.0650568282642	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.612244271245	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	1.97835427388e-06	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.90582858125	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	8.35931249787e-05	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	4.20662719994e-05	...Chris...
0.0	1.57604456386e-13	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.625784199069	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.884244940882	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	1.03874458103e-05	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	1.82770565333e-11	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.00480173712374	No their not.
0.0	0.34962127302	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.00278792968494	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.00510419370422	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.0108817070614	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.93614187599	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	1.6241699348e-06	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	9.35236093687e-07	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.000396379945544	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.552722296734	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.9927187355	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.918280706411	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.000160949634402	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.27510328241	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.145914843909	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.0468404710436	My point is this.
0.0	5.01033168572e-05	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.288625947558	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.691385162646	I never said that.
0.0	5.36591320484e-11	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.349134734356	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.000602028543751	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.858622588471	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.968843895442	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	5.83493366522e-08	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	5.14391684686e-05	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.989330155035	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.978500914737	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.000237221832205	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.77465663792	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.183645636391	No, you did.
0.0	7.59305057913e-05	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.0518198345636	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.015317902141	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.00897304369441	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.578426325866	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.26256324784	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	4.4132321258e-11	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.0515318668833	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.873648199122	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.983474591391	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.00373250771545	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.00113357376145	Thank you.
0.0	0.768853072413	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.777404531643	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.000324794798046	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.899097499902	He is a good man.
0.0	0.417510109306	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.00456595846609	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	2.37903799545e-05	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.514997168574	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.0941062217849	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.996698273155	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.994970798101	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.0021677937596	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.00785569576799	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.873394217043	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.0114519937523	I will put a price tag.
1.0	0.862905997118	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.806531620927	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.131185030091	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.949596037515	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.739421543994	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.475922468359	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.00245710011377	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.423190337443	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	5.8158756875e-07	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.369093829523	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.174012045551	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.00610604684808	It's not that hard.
0.0	1.0207771068e-09	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
1.0	0.831134844724	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	2.18695160481e-05	Can we stop?
0.0	0.982526576628	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.881237572943	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.923395160461	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.98467462222	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	4.24723656145e-19	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.0432228659835	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	5.92713394423e-08	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	1.26480988299e-19	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
1.0	0.712182499186	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.000125747966856	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.941902612631	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
1.0	0.0249292677616	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	1.42497302405e-05	You know why?
0.0	0.932687470666	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.596988779898	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	3.72444309125e-09	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.974980305356	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.896455695664	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.995820363123	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	4.29452080829e-10	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.368301042894	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.568403289593	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	5.61272040179e-11	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.847566281323	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.984054513133	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	3.46127457844e-07	And I think together we will make progress.
1.0	0.950290476354	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	4.33693783907e-19	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.933947400904	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.287539967368	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.39061651723	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.410707084954	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.696936434345	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.00508947283991	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.000799238795414	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	5.15141335323e-05	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.00294588623042	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.582355895532	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.449095108929	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	6.16323914417e-11	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.00491309934986	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.000241107442223	Yeah.
0.0	0.00213303006308	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.0811847009443	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	6.57508865073e-05	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.00113357376145	Thank you.
0.0	0.637627287014	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.635396166258	He wasn't my senator.

0.0	6.75447692366e-06	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.0343500023391	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.289110125655	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	2.12057290537e-13	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.931248127127	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.00349498819528	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.00362816316804	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.000101736077703	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.954834011247	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	8.6207196185e-10	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.277160115619	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	1.72080080991e-05	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.339986573268	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.447865901431	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.628493496966	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.495778891239	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.516755023991	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.713629259737	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.945678075784	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.979605647302	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	3.46176526948e-06	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.992329115311	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.00774481067005	Absolutely.
0.0	0.0171504637925	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.719751494747	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.950972018739	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.00178242254019	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.000178992196108	How about this?
0.0	0.0133722296766	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	3.9134917392e-07	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.201725082728	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	2.18861445345e-07	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
1.0	0.914347911013	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.923237673319	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	2.238262541e-11	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.835642066778	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.000146469032247	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
1.0	0.708901497074	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.00518422577242	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.00114733183639	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.239747431765	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.910067788622	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	2.47879412649e-07	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.331273413226	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	4.59423454572e-06	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.3296676531	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.00185975996742	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.859640219906	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.167448613001	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	7.03347945185e-08	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.000241107442223	OK?
0.0	0.990327597926	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.993810022921	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.501502328413	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.957414852863	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.000850906359489	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.999777374057	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.822388768417	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	1.20416309075e-11	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
1.0	0.829087320644	They stole it.
0.0	0.0026628787868	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.969498540968	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.908635475051	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	6.53863395856e-05	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.0469640959268	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.387941677997	We were wrong.
0.0	0.675748304715	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.000465626364413	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.502133318971	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.0239642199631	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.783266281771	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.537054745024	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.810037139389	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.666754422481	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.0938939053847	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.00700076528179	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.00162297165524	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.783429834129	We were behind where we were today.
1.0	0.905903758193	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.30123510693	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	5.40823525506e-06	They are not perfect.
0.0	5.53728896497e-05	I like that.
0.0	3.97110828727e-10	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.826810499853	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	5.4786644725e-06	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.690674976032	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.974286182415	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.68415721323	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.961127305027	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.210721529704	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.790425980543	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
1.0	0.928644225816	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.0781207561951	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.00352454876232	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	7.13945462018e-06	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.479843274106	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.700726023917	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.930761322835	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.916008971314	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.930781235792	I said no.
0.0	0.595840258458	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.617974224782	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.165773143491	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.735201052193	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.956119228453	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.871365648809	She said the truth.
0.0	5.66980836417e-06	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.811022087252	America was worth the wait.
0.0	4.77559163899e-07	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.985032443957	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.841061670303	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.467354239728	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	5.98308396826e-08	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.239631494526	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.279115053262	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.778488001398	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.0665072395004	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	1.00208162704e-22	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	3.36083383837e-08	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.00020784031983	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.077863888368	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.386658403989	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.718479161301	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	7.734693134e-08	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.712353611261	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	3.99366143688e-05	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.957985044253	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.759441861475	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.636940192593	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.154675117012	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.0482901249453	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.257318533801	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.964865459091	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.000795363871093	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.898583535309	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.0103518700375	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.329647376871	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.746844772515	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	7.44743524774e-11	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.774467157772	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.597663092248	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.19455465982	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.752677265414	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	2.91819617241e-11	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.0075056906879	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.000246955122116	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.936279370094	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.782202856885	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.773379022507	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
1.0	2.84098495125e-10	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.000318455576326	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.961111936347	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.000111621512711	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.0158077570707	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
1.0	5.11982411689e-07	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	8.57228712382e-05	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.386413372165	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.955167075436	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	6.25302177044e-05	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.975492147964	I said temporarily.
0.0	3.65147929349e-05	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.22333124219	That's an interesting question.
0.0	2.99260186665e-05	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	1.09579996048e-05	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.597390023507	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.0421952062589	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.924248470367	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.606044908783	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.606384102261	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	2.64446861338e-07	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.691385162646	I never said that.
0.0	0.747617939947	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.912515291697	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.470440034519	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.733825995903	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.000465626364413	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.489973015677	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	9.56910627196e-07	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	6.95639369174e-05	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.57383376279	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.984868363437	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	1.44988475808e-10	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.00113357376145	Thank you.
0.0	0.0173827084185	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.997095473549	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.436841739884	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.

0.0	0.039556740788	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.956674448163	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.753858319149	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.91229162348	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	3.49799495653e-05	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.

0.0	4.99254087635e-05	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.00152814375161	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.46921576709	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.000338079398876	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.0289290116629	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.00440877715712	But, I would also add this.
0.0	5.54793167772e-05	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.0257072021329	I recommended that the president go forward.
1.0	6.83649019348e-06	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.698005894043	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	1.20473875677e-05	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.995317905639	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	1.94337369318e-09	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.989662943026	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.766978150409	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	2.19892664446e-05	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.00827266925551	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	1.15239041513e-07	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	2.57424859526e-05	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.622533296468	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.0407893819229	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.95812263127	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.628566520515	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.0139507611398	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.277061745059	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	8.14787037452e-05	How do I know this?
0.0	3.27327000125e-07	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.899700393343	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	1.87100520777e-10	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.234100575945	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.275845782109	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
1.0	0.884542767035	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.340212976326	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.896606787474	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.983213887715	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.121977376241	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	6.67767469631e-06	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	7.80917237145e-08	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.154970683415	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.00012579975743	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	2.66241294225e-05	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.85810179779	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.826882115697	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.832017413882	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.573846584221	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.0258261193261	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.30368451685	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.789572429603	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	1.86644418345e-11	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	2.30728079206e-06	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.968190669769	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.975150811444	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.0215476725639	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.83653313688	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.000464097388595	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.873394217043	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.823218457455	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.666233290759	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.223527819965	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.102047237756	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.772456984564	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.685324886559	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.603540731912	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	6.93815922532e-09	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.0811478807297	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.0642800811015	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.961558360772	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	4.01354192596e-05	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.0111955967807	No, John.
0.0	0.580367915801	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.850809693361	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
1.0	0.0151418042164	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.891988235949	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.0173817320193	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	3.29334844089e-06	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.000241107442223	Yes.
0.0	0.0511140721073	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.0037027363663	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.604023104403	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	2.18543292818e-05	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.0169657787108	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
1.0	0.355041309271	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.0122001341769	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.733153688188	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.698778184841	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.974777876521	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.0006948016665	in particular.
0.0	0.590668351219	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.170615988392	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.00107818041813	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	1.74804163362e-05	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	2.54746305766e-05	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.999990173363	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.89033479078	We are at 90 percent coverage.

0.0	0.889429520733	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.83090419834	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.997705665105	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	3.17077165331e-05	This is extraordinary.
0.0	8.98492471279e-05	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	1.75186820837e-17	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.728408955963	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.00351656028415	I will not do that.
0.0	0.986309681021	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.952978894234	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.

0.0	0.000625593603168	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.

0.0	0.00481442729552	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.923292730573	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.238055177453	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.00737874084976	So what if mass unemployment exists?

0.0	0.010254147926	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	7.07618235019e-06	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	1.6852556256e-07	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.0449340179306	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	6.73524608481e-06	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.0014822076398	I know how to do that.
1.0	0.992279512256	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.

0.0	0.410564085598	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.183982457944	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.38859487655	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.138233276425	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.00232165339586	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	7.87186436557e-06	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.988786239181	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.87473263407	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.963716353171	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.908333076104	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	3.37032420955e-05	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	6.99673739104e-09	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.77276669328	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.0182548058549	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	9.86388775553e-08	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.48307105175	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	3.82161705847e-10	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	2.01557169626e-05	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.0004415222441	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.0356124976588	Just ditto to that.

1.0	0.760544664525	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.993525924354	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.0607683618353	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.00928772461237	I came as a reformer.

0.0	0.00252388741314	You do.
0.0	4.95003358229e-07	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.

0.0	0.793410429891	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.951083982018	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
