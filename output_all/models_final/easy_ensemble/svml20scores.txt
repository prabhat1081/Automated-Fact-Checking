0.0	0.467733647442	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.477015915292	And you can't do that to the party.

0.0	0.505877162701	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.

0.0	0.485978054903	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.

0.0	0.452487024623	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.499848381272	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.496237113045	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.556539378888	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.450439763981	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.461082105893	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.462394877441	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.501792608824	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
1.0	0.483558182973	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.541900676206	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.4685614389	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.479591452293	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.489644100442	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.498702331638	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.482141491423	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.537031661251	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.501311929952	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.49796031205	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.491512636475	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.477015915292	But I would add this.
0.0	0.458348122815	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.543124238151	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.471029031789	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.469866103216	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.481988129208	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.52366599728	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.45308530971	...
0.0	0.459090886259	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.491111114929	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.475830618569	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.470778092615	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.439441635439	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.486913962833	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.44694049947	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.495816220533	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.498432828653	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.472946264771	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.489085445474	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.485612303197	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.49323448723	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.491143320057	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.45204228786	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.50964432973	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.472237314543	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.492850678501	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.488168380286	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.43942644259	We don't need that.
0.0	0.459954452209	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.480826712465	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.489924897862	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.418813986096	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.476155850726	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.498533888592	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.468447776119	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.483559464834	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.458465308429	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.481564364067	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.546919387926	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.473903542407	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.487493917084	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.554893725526	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.435415627954	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.44277822866	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.454550110281	I do.
0.0	0.435852343142	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.454550110281	No.
0.0	0.452829804233	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.484096347386	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.468614467207	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.421800073029	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.454576459241	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.467247483337	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.454288571028	And you know what?
0.0	0.491593487824	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.4749755192	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.470249472319	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.487543294442	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.4633520688	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.491435538819	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.493911411766	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.494168536601	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.548166638421	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.493047242256	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.476223679251	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.440751552787	I like that.
0.0	0.451464443545	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.479895634972	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.458362746116	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.482281761386	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.531303642073	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?

0.0	0.430174570773	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.

0.0	0.479060181717	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.47487780934	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.465733527847	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.424128203485	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.

0.0	0.496345383097	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.445876334054	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.459149795363	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.564091665763	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.474039397352	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.456915838146	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.532204676998	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.

1.0	0.513110225037	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
1.0	0.533674397824	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.487843933655	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.

0.0	0.480919535479	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.520732481914	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.467499391532	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
1.0	0.53009667452	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.532271953204	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.499077188499	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.

0.0	0.440160015439	Well, yes, indeed.

0.0	0.475581971197	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.482198158362	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.514377759659	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.480316628799	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.471530555625	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.475655673761	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.

0.0	0.496433474002	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.476301105114	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.51232932576	And Lehman Brothers started it all.

0.0	0.44161340388	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.4808011814	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.496229752808	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.450833699374	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.481418662263	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.464984308119	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.481795465711	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.473375359966	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
1.0	0.478807415239	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.476338211926	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.493974796023	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.500086740156	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.464989839109	... he's really doing some bad...
1.0	0.494618062946	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.476788982246	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.466159589718	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.467329312373	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.454369211206	I like Marco Rubio.

0.0	0.457130200682	We haven't.
0.0	0.488014833938	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.496332241275	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.516537406236	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.515496931534	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.482692708455	I've laid out...
0.0	0.439679856598	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.470858095051	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.514417296753	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.4835694664	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.483272482767	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.517450142121	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.502021891353	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.48981880777	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
1.0	0.537630079571	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.467154469648	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.491623763973	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.463430554383	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.448478046909	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.533495261773	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.560391426109	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.493067563165	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.454550110281	No.
0.0	0.503364280279	My name was mentioned here.
1.0	0.488377242664	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.478995089579	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.477748537562	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.502466398675	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.476097487208	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.4673003461	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.485032921269	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.453428089319	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.472097282904	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.477038960696	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.446877787593	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.480316628799	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.49102453146	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.481712293897	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.428212786924	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.49161816168	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.471295936499	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.438763552788	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.470586864888	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.460671615072	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.500052159314	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.484970663603	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.454620002831	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.508024095984	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.457130200682	It goes away.
0.0	0.497238681572	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.461644113057	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.547014844841	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.460402536049	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.458385171592	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.530073310819	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.491124482651	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.478495649188	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.465407246278	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.508215314979	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.488744022987	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.454550110281	Right.
0.0	0.490276779832	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.513145380156	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.495701172761	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.497960532256	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.498581847405	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.482060269456	That's not true.
0.0	0.465304592842	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.

0.0	0.481483234373	This stuff is fantasy.

0.0	0.48005955687	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.463699098055	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.473536943415	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.478798105069	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.473757456948	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.503423585694	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.494095802329	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.495626541769	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.

0.0	0.526077768379	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.483558182973	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.524134897291	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.492100506965	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.463157195502	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.480398063123	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.496620758209	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.455795613298	Wait for what?

0.0	0.491638230517	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.465624112951	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.548565087197	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
1.0	0.51275363789	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.497015276662	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.490239990292	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.478528033662	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.473470131736	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.540568114523	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.504648241772	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.481360754974	Our next president...
0.0	0.461698976153	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.455795613298	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.498741550719	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.502034851591	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.45265463155	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.464897678735	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.497148486208	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.423741137937	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.456528770178	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.419994466607	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.498286448161	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.449278376237	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.457130200682	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.479097901824	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.505352182151	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.501393341705	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.456531915595	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.483152591239	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.502252906415	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.452386471211	I'm too agreeable, easy going.

0.0	0.4945885707	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.508323764753	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.482262730472	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.426005785141	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.522955849071	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.532350741809	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.491034622017	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.455795613298	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.516501133453	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
1.0	0.491973467033	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.471220520127	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.483582362829	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.489125091707	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.475175257711	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.489018552475	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.48091222292	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.480209231603	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.462854106849	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.470930160276	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.496588524676	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.513084866501	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.514604533654	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.558597233273	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.49073620377	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.481937020775	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.410764436868	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.52123763356	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.484085212556	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.465417233771	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.43923509779	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.500319063912	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.524261844643	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.395465094207	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.455062028797	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.454550110281	John?
0.0	0.501184177108	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.480172744134	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.488513131663	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.523434935541	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.486360741551	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.436864738813	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.489528246914	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.530375217825	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.456847203191	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.470790387863	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
1.0	0.551847947914	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.454550110281	Ever.
0.0	0.477588116684	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.50465522037	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.481502116598	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.514898149132	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.471916998794	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.448273721312	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.523006720461	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.550867771411	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.500021426694	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.492474696746	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.489382803027	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.56445439318	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.480004876796	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.479965877685	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.553770082643	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.493242010131	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.473633422136	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.454550110281	OK?
0.0	0.505775141126	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.439286271632	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.474485961852	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.496651436635	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.522138947244	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.509912943123	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.557182734255	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.455022155529	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.473704656281	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.404463322555	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.538654080588	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.469664273895	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.473702771497	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.52439570524	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.501363016616	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.439061549859	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.454550807233	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.499928015059	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.480047768001	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.507841188407	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.484171719036	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.482464610744	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.526170837257	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.478911754236	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.500143640588	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.551158933806	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.467010153601	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.50664901355	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.465010288241	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.388644324068	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.451738497461	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.4780453479	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.482953340171	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.482237512919	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.500972745104	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.498305012691	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.505073755291	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.478480991758	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.465121079046	We need sound money.
0.0	0.460771330992	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.429913020659	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.489850686722	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.479575597827	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.472162380316	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.461613455589	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.480601148828	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.450569788869	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.468654817549	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.480532905855	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.481952545847	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.439436503683	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.49356131182	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.44265347101	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.463766557707	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.46813793708	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.483630759366	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.481629074036	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.550462650571	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.459749800149	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.493176613103	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.481473302964	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.493937413194	...income tax...
0.0	0.521200548086	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.474484642268	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.493429184764	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.489443488582	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.445607074461	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.45023361682	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.479739509016	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.459332554544	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.435931584315	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.482263987221	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.489954622715	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.461388528498	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.476937051063	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.459894376511	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.453215522897	Thank you.
0.0	0.499219222629	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.496395372019	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.482778686874	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.539283957693	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.459578243951	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.490063579223	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.452386471211	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.478686679667	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.480571180275	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.476107526335	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.542805621293	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.436725358607	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.499669161929	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.454550110281	Absolutely.
0.0	0.501348841139	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.542065146752	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.470668572102	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.488329587452	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.45089274	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.513010119926	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.460421066032	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.468512331511	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.530815135175	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.419105782563	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
1.0	0.513848528811	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.479512652368	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.486299477698	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.521526766096	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.479097901824	This will end.
0.0	0.495131702907	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.4810268214	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.516784857172	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.452182586302	I can.
0.0	0.476417259621	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.491616518772	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.470318422285	Think back to Garland, Texas.
1.0	0.522416171856	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.458913642795	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.55162411383	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.458673788478	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.526798558293	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.520108610027	Two points.
0.0	0.487561887362	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.479779869612	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.467580252143	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.487420117411	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.493989525319	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.481246452792	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.498608511573	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.457130200682	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.469261032041	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.480826712465	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.454843175584	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.469579562169	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.493405564474	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.537547720233	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.498289797434	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.405241414179	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.45308530971	...
0.0	0.513245680209	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.452205950988	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.502979969313	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
1.0	0.539283957693	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
1.0	0.541308783597	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.498353524683	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.463511075907	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.468424682489	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.481660477837	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.492880729305	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
1.0	0.513975281831	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
1.0	0.514611379669	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.479473842079	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.480988312387	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.534464678991	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.506609285901	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
1.0	0.576873728012	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.470697651412	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.454550110281	It is.
0.0	0.455143789299	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.478705814382	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.487405350152	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.480884546083	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.453921812588	in particular.
0.0	0.526385644391	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.485167411422	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.47427545014	No, you did.
0.0	0.453607706449	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.549205355812	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.448194972458	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.55676561455	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.475239437314	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.501566298335	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.442860467024	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.51010143047	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.54647343629	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.482839765555	That is important.
0.0	0.479194659559	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.510796740948	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.492727901696	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.490732282779	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.426026537895	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.469608941381	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.45308530971	...
0.0	0.4622110336	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.556822789664	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.476894582182	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.489946734736	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.457130200682	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.464096560344	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.482262730472	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.469875501218	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.449653729265	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.46724566578	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.483483951804	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.479191658731	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.458465308429	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.501337517091	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.446961504928	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.542970981613	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.542820037135	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.504143388881	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.499965106261	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.448922501442	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.460830260776	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.48366203102	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.493019286933	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
1.0	0.540710841029	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.467575961311	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.505389359853	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.529103474766	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.526373569494	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.482924526537	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.472871667004	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.507323062078	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.453428089319	I can do that.
0.0	0.496945963702	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.489745178012	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.519878446269	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.463534598925	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.474018408528	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.516519558346	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.480884098265	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.490285147871	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.482198158362	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.459693138894	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.481611196182	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.453989218934	You really can't.
0.0	0.488174598161	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.517786476562	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.455795613298	Think about that.
0.0	0.499666142404	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.470068120136	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.509228127137	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.480105049984	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.484724775142	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.482052318699	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.480149703122	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.461741696851	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.500039388929	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.437372172646	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.41081993867	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.472086163364	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.545634520057	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.482831814798	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.47487780934	I never said that.
0.0	0.463107749819	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.510402364893	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
1.0	0.478214891923	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.547851208911	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.457767119762	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.479865098631	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.438537361296	I think you're --
0.0	0.523049344399	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.482831814798	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.51221031727	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.482128405912	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.430675350698	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.422934041017	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.452056346464	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.479333831857	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.494420433759	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.506678739193	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.451017137825	But look...
0.0	0.490169009347	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.494152838102	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.467421151933	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.45595922592	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.461934446588	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.463123665777	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.492944954303	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.484443283259	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.464919776631	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.435368287573	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.487960420651	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.473344478028	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.5276938661	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.495975214311	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.465559581463	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.508739741514	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.482266271376	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.44181684635	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.555735618936	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.498666666206	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.496029901871	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.463184789536	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.499447899693	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.474462718563	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.478495649188	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.469683353507	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.497021138608	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.469986283075	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.483558182973	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.554796639359	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.480943626721	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.516816694153	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.54832067161	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.493521686615	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.491654681003	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.506713273361	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.535588082972	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.482052318699	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.501078098371	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.471554335443	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.495134203839	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.468262846254	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.494266497745	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.455148543399	And guess what?
0.0	0.484221812392	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.516918468963	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.53002833529	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.490776441856	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.453607706449	We have a country of borders.

0.0	0.530163985257	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.484265998088	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.432306231195	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.569773522112	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.450969854291	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.493252134305	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
1.0	0.535522436234	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.472297718939	You did.
0.0	0.486134466734	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.454830219797	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.428566785956	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.458465308429	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.471844062907	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.451639547874	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.486204049254	That never works.
0.0	0.502648663587	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.473536943415	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.53059259967	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.536035865181	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.482182520259	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.53635647242	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.447298039752	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.516527380635	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.521581853066	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.454550110281	OK?
0.0	0.537747126363	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.480574544349	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.481629074036	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.450899901417	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.521507346843	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.498470481125	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.483558182973	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.488303317837	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.465009887459	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.527566000516	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.476748062868	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.448429203791	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.457130200682	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.49880203795	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.481308787508	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.523554465476	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.481685114644	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.474356849134	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.465277275465	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.495160715333	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.553875468141	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.532015808246	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.48411760824	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.482665735316	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
1.0	0.502023097888	They stole it.
0.0	0.427431012097	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.447508023365	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.47487780934	I got that.
0.0	0.467089480328	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.495422864805	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
1.0	0.508711972501	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.566153901173	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.48241014075	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.476670240001	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.480886206347	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.49832466844	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.452834248681	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.482923647053	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.485682805804	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.53486283009	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.4896182084	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.49309443532	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.481128575936	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.401415897037	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.412806445316	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.51923353585	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
1.0	0.555061641805	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.463957227377	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.43072270311	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.457897951235	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.479306664772	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.492267984164	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.488961916296	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.47714825808	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.466105603205	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.505427877976	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.503663735582	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.407771613535	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.463414812842	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.430357049553	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.532555625854	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.499337542235	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.493497645391	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.549315090244	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.499811379594	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.485164821516	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.478528033662	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.43114414543	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.514417296753	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.488451194599	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.463783025622	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.546621635662	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.454550110281	Right.
0.0	0.554210871448	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.449960565775	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.453215522897	Thank you.
0.0	0.454550110281	You do.
0.0	0.464473374791	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.472193448778	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.481486798719	We don't win.
0.0	0.482825541428	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.487877887084	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.464730153564	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.482963686749	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.471489577078	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.568889633045	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.499023807361	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.452370645446	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.480918881434	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.461752882995	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.464416705779	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.465590220069	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.548222518793	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.477230731326	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.504264629013	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.482823138611	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.502995472246	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.565788231238	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.570222244471	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.488626362387	We had Boko Haram.
1.0	0.565245526895	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.482825541428	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.452233523958	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.53146178215	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.500382792796	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
1.0	0.51384888305	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.468597735543	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.467032367741	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.441677902072	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.485903360446	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.470068120136	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.432745563735	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.480090613487	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.525553365824	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.482052318699	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.482229163948	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.543513692181	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.502954982798	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.

0.0	0.536759426073	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.503104916556	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.459710097273	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.495293978429	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.

0.0	0.492223012825	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.489565594203	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.451550168879	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.504086605634	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.457000507858	That has not been...
0.0	0.445205535328	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.495573337858	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.522213195477	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.454288571028	And you know what?
0.0	0.486630087828	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.500655549369	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.488308529436	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.523943407601	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).

0.0	0.448647913824	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.477938322469	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.48005955687	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.520116329062	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.489595572732	We've saved billions of dollars.

0.0	0.503626570716	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.481868034118	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.487852347478	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.479400357705	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.457130200682	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.479457897793	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.468573139234	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.483473421991	That's my bill.
0.0	0.484724171684	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.530847874657	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.483390841485	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.479097901824	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.470529866998	You bet they do.
0.0	0.455795613298	Think about it.
0.0	0.488832157487	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.541194468397	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.481126631715	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.475247313915	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.525968923454	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.500021298494	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.547592265307	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
1.0	0.522299681344	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.455022155529	How do I know this?
0.0	0.510987207452	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.481355009371	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.454550110281	I have.
0.0	0.516062848081	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.454852081077	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.456846629883	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.447454402289	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.453215522897	Thank you.
0.0	0.436780635298	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.502047977185	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.467663768497	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.491036946692	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.453923515734	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.494131240918	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.498263513348	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.490275178327	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.468118156831	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.49353039479	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.545113727772	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.482831814798	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.393048600214	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.452829804233	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.514395008025	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.437810196718	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.489586417969	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.438474077629	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.482831814798	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.492872909578	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.479021719068	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.547613101751	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.496416515739	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.463203916429	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.44681278886	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.511156488009	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.457008997719	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.524696343437	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.454550110281	OK?
0.0	0.485128024799	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.481118011797	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.510931052115	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.469810465874	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.518755265116	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.452275601972	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.495410580572	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.453215522897	Thank you.
1.0	0.49930919289	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.481974428047	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.477344246972	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.455795613298	Check it out.
0.0	0.494971659246	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.519650634557	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.451386641188	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.497209657428	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.452979408757	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.480091554229	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
1.0	0.511175363686	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.448972944462	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.482963934619	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.504124657393	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.488624292192	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.465424324826	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.470828881071	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.493147589028	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
1.0	0.519976609992	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.518845291954	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.479528555924	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.395050131108	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.480915479379	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.497079057133	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.497695789454	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.431626966654	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.4810268214	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.505807971164	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.453215522897	Thank you.
0.0	0.521812816615	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.476985581598	They will -- some will follow.
1.0	0.482198158362	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.479097901824	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.457002657574	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.519119373974	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.487168150642	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
1.0	0.52093219061	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.468319072743	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.457130200682	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.461270225925	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.548302998987	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.563583029866	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.498419613922	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.480073646183	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.415736369801	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.468611957624	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.49654647221	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.477384952534	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.52074661414	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.494808663486	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.453428089319	What should we do?
0.0	0.447181413903	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.511366766206	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.480985249658	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.489071051199	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.460474829034	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.450769548878	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.497927209385	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.500472664017	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.498536305132	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.482831814798	We're running.
0.0	0.480918881434	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.481900268117	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.49436068267	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.47487780934	I never said that.
0.0	0.483271429964	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.454550110281	No.
0.0	0.499769335192	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.524545981962	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.498019167547	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.463494604215	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.455130160134	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.543752927426	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.559478275858	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.498209443079	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.491132343594	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.488287219414	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.500086740156	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.491216135188	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.496283096224	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.538384611277	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.491658952008	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.477799008356	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.552844119415	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.509236326007	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.516845018488	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
1.0	0.528810932873	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.485835723298	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.477750287749	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.473529734863	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.475197103731	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.46583520677	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.482839765555	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.481570760729	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.477444833208	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.564928132922	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.522800409775	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.516061115661	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.483489169743	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.488742962835	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.46699066236	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
1.0	0.481418662263	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.498376013405	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.540285523067	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.457130200682	It never happens.
0.0	0.486134466734	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.479097901824	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.520537033945	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.487113399924	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.435220185975	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.482356842245	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.487814881413	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.51398955923	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.450109356208	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.503330552203	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.468057004009	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.504456116074	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.490453139943	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.456501902989	That's not right.
0.0	0.497510565723	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.473686904214	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.547181966636	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.477577179911	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.49019160811	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.453109037496	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.47693173273	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.51381517412	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.465164814325	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.495823498649	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.4898743558	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.491151920546	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.457130200682	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.491597070574	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.497321774879	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.482642122754	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.509534916741	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.488754318636	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.471704123735	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.481486798719	I don't care.
0.0	0.482924526537	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.497321774879	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.429903549763	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.510710128159	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.504606981256	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.508150812325	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.478151039835	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.447259081954	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.481486798719	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.501452465429	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.509282579619	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.528065149231	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.51106641038	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.477114505222	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.448740323872	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.50127679596	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.537236060178	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.529061646394	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.482924526537	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.516280640526	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.497321774879	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.506105224019	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.482831814798	It's their money.
0.0	0.495951028653	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.49243785826	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.497087571704	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.452487024623	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.464350651683	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.481486798719	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.508606201308	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.436780635298	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.480843263321	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.459151241093	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.499241740125	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.511535698265	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.458465308429	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.453955006423	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.50480328111	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.453776652512	They know.
0.0	0.479987687885	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.525512106685	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.438834905242	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.482924526537	It continues with regulatory reform.
1.0	0.524926187401	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.444015345508	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.48947686918	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.479097901824	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.453053580104	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.51232932576	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
1.0	0.455197328211	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.472477283828	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.470254927459	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.519038887606	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.520736032377	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.479683626407	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.505276973901	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.452297550662	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.482892569033	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.478072157946	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.422487221859	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.485568946754	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.509046900501	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.494804108908	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.479060575622	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.431364061875	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
1.0	0.515687136125	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.49830105779	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.460701552332	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.493834586916	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.468324090544	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.4835380626	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.487322388453	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.507747409129	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.457130200682	It never happens.
0.0	0.512829893049	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.455795613298	Divide that out.
0.0	0.49453167898	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.461320562841	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.45023589919	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.495704273992	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.497022266384	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.499139279171	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.472737680259	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.474769162085	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.4808325852	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.519310893662	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.496024110489	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.454688784518	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.45308530971	Becky --
0.0	0.436487407896	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.482262730472	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.480529291409	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.532164003319	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.488961690631	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.449107354136	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.483338837581	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.481629074036	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.500231049268	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.440751552787	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.431023876086	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.477017735581	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.474359823663	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.477938171416	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.483597343185	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.499947164681	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.420721882738	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.464416705779	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.510998791844	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.478528033662	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.485363248607	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.453215522897	See?
0.0	0.497153738026	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.465521055817	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.458559268764	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.49980152291	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.49866050336	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.518377501965	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.454550110281	Yes.
0.0	0.476515038027	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.462851520228	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.486165870534	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.496024110489	That is our government today.
1.0	0.551304056421	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.485039262525	You've got to bring people together.
1.0	0.568823830099	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.438206607549	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.500284828687	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.491263258303	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.475821366434	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.524675241875	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.482052318699	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.523576634897	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.47056152636	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.454375127994	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.494003748726	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.473763076891	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
1.0	0.509538327842	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.480745373784	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.492284912433	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.479896062555	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.571674583913	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.514771262153	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.493339370828	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.457127055265	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.45920700969	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.573591930126	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.498810541371	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.488724042487	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.422247550055	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.493475471534	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.480753324541	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.493492088061	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.457130200682	That's right.
0.0	0.479097901824	I would change them.
0.0	0.538876828666	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.516104236792	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.480845057153	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.452144951035	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.493887252362	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.482325438445	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.499533814835	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.516527380635	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.467070650492	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.492219840268	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.468741100369	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.484812370526	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.481883135484	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.477535318201	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.465674709855	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.

0.0	0.485675612034	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.456531915595	No, he doesn't.
1.0	0.493475006579	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.483004650567	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.534170986359	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.496214384612	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.52351888428	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.471716265471	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.432188974562	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
1.0	0.558243584749	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.444933847071	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.483558182973	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.501311929952	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.480995279741	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.467119659791	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.482831814798	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.473285774337	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.493394088809	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.531605022682	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.488401668976	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.521490930378	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.513398301416	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.497321774879	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.513865428981	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.468488375527	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.527957616529	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.481352804218	In addition to that...
0.0	0.419244098067	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.465990276351	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
1.0	0.502828995648	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.469671363432	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.541567274364	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.46995092042	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.456531915595	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.511662310291	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.495640419366	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.469527513293	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.478180100858	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
1.0	0.486482244708	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.483632383359	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.486204049254	Just for the record.
0.0	0.506744526069	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.459842704052	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.550817798716	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.453215522897	Thank you.
0.0	0.478705814382	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.46735733975	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.480224028812	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.482257624144	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.514607856548	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.455795613298	Think about it.
0.0	0.497268503396	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.430509415098	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.482189482174	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.452275601972	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.46364808126	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.478915637888	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.494848601124	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.446366874175	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.478130215945	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.447563907821	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.531379181535	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.470112901608	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.502723760378	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.484839789085	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.541914370267	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.488480528698	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.477792413909	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.480377414116	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.494757310614	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.457130200682	We are not France.
0.0	0.480007788138	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.473188579356	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.513246875621	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.462317386452	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.475511082441	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.467191919269	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.496593185649	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.450207289847	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.457327053794	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.457130200682	That's what he is.
0.0	0.487547619269	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.41546458357	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.48101990031	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.506138400425	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.476759693281	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.484813326229	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.482839765555	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.482465860033	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.467994171651	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.49436065659	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.49036477366	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.536628996956	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.54460555763	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.443102667008	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.497255009084	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.452829804233	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.463660242657	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.4289148753	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
1.0	0.544994291362	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.437482795849	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.536384954342	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.47870278617	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.480978424864	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.452487024623	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.485114490903	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.492963381122	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.482198158362	That's good.
0.0	0.480225108729	I promise.
0.0	0.455197328211	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.537260964406	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.44997340547	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.480750551582	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.533303297718	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.50676386817	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.462773109721	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.490915617674	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.476449794137	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.482831814798	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.477808080992	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.501775407952	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.50057016468	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.484225269183	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.456356742913	You know that.
0.0	0.528178796393	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.469750370899	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.524818259655	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.481070565277	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.488979533085	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.482189482174	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.485705067907	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.494806914787	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
1.0	0.495104386079	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.505962887933	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.45729691176	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.455197328211	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.535457796336	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.501931579937	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.410943492388	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.451054366734	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.481463136414	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.532182592686	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.523207270461	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
1.0	0.517723126024	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.540811947802	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.458465308429	I've done it.
0.0	0.48986203951	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.469110869443	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.482215688569	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.480285224998	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.546048107667	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.480826712465	We're friends.
0.0	0.4926521818	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.484411879459	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.529270242903	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.434154954047	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.477040370405	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.454288571028	And you know what?
0.0	0.519707806221	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.497762535515	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.506901491941	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.438711893449	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.501335385537	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.499036243797	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.527398127436	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.454550110281	Yes.
0.0	0.484411879459	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.49462951046	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.512422379911	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.485519981599	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.559997964309	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.542009393577	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.47219406021	And, we said no.
0.0	0.546474649178	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.454550110281	Dynamically.
0.0	0.49630335575	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.489801910933	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.496685521094	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.515596274927	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
1.0	0.480142738815	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.502234575221	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.51195130511	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.521574755662	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.463717945124	I understand.
0.0	0.507519163585	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.467329312373	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.478481994362	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.478051600864	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.497321774879	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.429670737548	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.515513224724	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.484199843691	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.483486501989	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.484176132561	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.508363711	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.454288571028	And you know what?

0.0	0.459705416194	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.499580894432	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.

0.0	0.421541519664	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.464386048311	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.482711567234	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.45469723399	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.509191338589	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.50272692789	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.509647842892	The student loan problem has been created by government.

0.0	0.504741343923	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.530962501184	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.480975936424	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.499398041248	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.482831814798	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.517297705714	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.452979408757	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.487096138674	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.520043107562	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.500086740156	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.500086740156	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.494690563285	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.454242308126	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.465160278617	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.504920260186	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.466856953757	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.518527120803	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.4810268214	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.492969281776	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.513848528811	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.520693027987	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.462448363221	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.493472675873	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.475531775604	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.503903235906	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.561201221449	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.48002257101	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.470370776779	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.497691791536	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.446413890376	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.47717324803	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.489950897704	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.456379014674	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.480111717348	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.507887918027	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.483554643958	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.484245875842	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.522802467066	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.481629074036	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.4541612462	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.500612323242	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.499699752468	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.474384647351	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.453428089319	I will not do that.
0.0	0.490820933148	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.542987270176	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.481405216112	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.440751552787	I think he is right.
0.0	0.552147376582	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.480826712465	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.480492975278	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.466029125995	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.464076844558	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.553445334444	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
1.0	0.51071497725	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.529022859622	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.481100090585	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.483449715272	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.482264980026	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.417194389416	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.500151642585	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.455251891268	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.475533532304	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.492198016542	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.533665372778	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.429082638054	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.45736591314	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.461318831561	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.482831814798	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.466316872824	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.450137464883	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.468460165358	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.454433731104	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.548835157875	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.453061988249	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.477307415046	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.477632234399	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.481359439625	Or that we're just going to be great?
1.0	0.550650081295	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.433703565534	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.498523319062	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.48723336617	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.516112689062	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.494586183843	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.492247303099	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.467358325023	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.448616655386	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.467552220778	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.44434137489	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.484266039795	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.470783686783	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.477055269849	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.4808325852	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.46995092042	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.482214333935	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.450859925406	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.479453563387	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.490871944215	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.472798566383	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.457130200682	You looking at me?
0.0	0.484198475312	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.499670575971	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.466633486671	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.453518033845	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.447411874545	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.456183821521	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.479825364249	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.524842852568	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.499507526802	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.555813382337	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
1.0	0.524907301708	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.451568003667	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.47276005482	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.437620389069	And I think together we will make progress.
1.0	0.494757636556	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.464416705779	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.454570661189	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.454288571028	And you know what?
0.0	0.488496532354	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.487400963627	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.466964456025	We need security.
0.0	0.454550110281	Absolutely.
1.0	0.520762830843	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
1.0	0.545552375258	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.496615385069	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.485045535895	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.472978049896	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.484970663603	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.550571186244	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.

0.0	0.476973614399	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.473943732054	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.505286326623	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.444117041819	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.481288207206	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.455130160134	Well, sure.
0.0	0.453215522897	Thank you.
0.0	0.466118059108	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.483042180015	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.46995092042	I totally get that.
0.0	0.49457307016	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.482831814798	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.456091558085	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.472679916926	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.497321774879	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.483632383359	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.497180096096	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.50987625868	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.447305244046	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.519118766714	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.490671883901	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.507163576809	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
1.0	0.572066661378	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.489961286099	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.490788895416	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.51327535653	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.459078325467	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.474897257043	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.482198158362	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.491511354528	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.532215992035	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.493714064391	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.489133947878	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.469198362283	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.443378671554	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.482237512919	OK, good.
0.0	0.482964272679	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.514532993788	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.46296573035	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.512747469153	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.449187282488	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.497493313373	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.495110568305	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.48351114107	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.482198158362	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.47822537851	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.5057519151	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.501670811299	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.471263908112	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.454550110281	Right.
0.0	0.480918881434	Where are you gonna clean it up?
1.0	0.510590606773	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.472297718939	It was.
0.0	0.485783187497	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.416455635571	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.462027771499	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.481191515056	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.477807282533	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.50827581097	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.466409664302	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.484008319607	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.444800927519	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.454258654203	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.482198158362	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.499936101507	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.469358804724	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.494205874797	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.49654643966	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.523668449572	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.482429122147	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.487455345013	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.433572318645	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.486074616569	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.444827271566	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.455055913971	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.468229034525	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.500655549369	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.522747017901	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.470756112862	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.453428089319	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.523930354728	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.491851810971	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.482815457608	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.518023606524	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.480707302619	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.51577102615	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.471352384059	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.476955745597	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.465883125293	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.489098541801	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.46043456478	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.46695686186	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.504592686848	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.507385859467	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.47236912862	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.479739509016	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.482831814798	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.472025408364	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.456765870696	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.48351390954	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.474100706837	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.453215522897	Thank you.
0.0	0.496276527276	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.463268288777	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.440654274497	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.453607706449	This country is changing.
0.0	0.464984308119	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.520612034501	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.518692845544	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.489477410719	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.463014424824	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.507706170144	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.467304220715	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.468573139234	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.456555260667	No, it's true.
0.0	0.481418662263	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.453607706449	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.528706274191	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.45308530971	That is...
1.0	0.547415075865	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.452446149633	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.57096619135	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.45308530971	Neil...
0.0	0.508476145997	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.556304986944	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.428263828825	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.464416705779	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.457130200682	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.498695039191	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.477226803802	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.501311929952	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.43221987681	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.495243286257	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.482198158362	He's wrong.
0.0	0.45308530971	Maria...
0.0	0.503917289364	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.476783269819	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.489276762173	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.483566187255	Good at email.
0.0	0.421863042044	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.466492536691	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.470075317883	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.453428089319	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.503757443554	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.499366208925	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.49559820387	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.539851756202	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.484391064422	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.477642350752	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.519009471103	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.470394871102	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.527531583606	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.503142937587	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.482831814798	My point is this.
0.0	0.433572318645	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.495977966679	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.538810785457	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.479563294612	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.491624629607	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.477795266112	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.489617211856	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.513070120165	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.482062824486	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.503483539987	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.463930021665	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.460143833418	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.455931870074	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.522760740019	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.4914360002	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.458518666107	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.465121079046	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.493462035427	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.475292502532	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.497383989956	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.494502803364	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.453526800322	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.486764060635	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.492102710162	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
1.0	0.461087411833	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.484199843691	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.522607302797	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.496207005373	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.536439778913	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.469882783963	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.53211800505	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.547451630896	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.481486798719	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.483691210918	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
1.0	0.50601113612	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.436272690919	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.491994128232	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.458224411068	The number of women --
0.0	0.498622781686	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.460979912033	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.508705772983	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.482229562162	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.492538894852	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
1.0	0.486894656657	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.458269381356	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.47883078722	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.532613261591	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.476741182771	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.450644690972	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.410202461417	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.493343754712	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.46863213984	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.463074261556	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.483731148261	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.457130200682	No their not.
0.0	0.438834905242	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.46153652006	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.460133405271	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.486066886857	He has never defended...
0.0	0.453215522897	Thank you.
0.0	0.506594120801	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.525727934813	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.499331449825	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.497513050894	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.501636988784	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
1.0	0.530727945894	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.553489884405	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.444609178721	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.503830215531	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.470063994976	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.457130200682	You're right.
0.0	0.505917888695	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.510015390891	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.488922830472	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.447603566245	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.435241813049	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.45308530971	Again...
0.0	0.535149840299	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.490194596457	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.471295936499	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.429547715021	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.465071634599	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.47548478986	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.519440506357	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.462905997994	And we need to do that throughout the country.
1.0	0.504572592576	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.468367555062	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.539033795185	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
1.0	0.534787236626	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.454692237796	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.502868826097	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.483632383359	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.479591452293	Big difference.
0.0	0.545278589052	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.484904075484	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.554872382696	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.506217847435	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.535333844959	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.488044965024	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.436101850532	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.483407728116	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.522242879205	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.480982613664	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.515478256593	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.456493038714	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.455167315605	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.463180771452	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.480203321747	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.498027825437	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.483862134089	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.490033420061	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.505706533346	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.453821029633	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.454550110281	Yeah.
0.0	0.481629074036	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.53810325025	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.561255508286	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.467933025327	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.466719896848	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.493760045272	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.484790896718	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.547277282569	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.503070619006	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.466499545353	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.550814791614	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.466324651193	I love China.
0.0	0.458457140527	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.494643184188	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.453857001502	And here's why.
0.0	0.483418429331	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.45302568548	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.477925781026	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.49671698516	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.523630348537	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.471129776131	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.516081105195	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.534000052288	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.554490064483	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.501455139363	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.464416705779	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.488900261277	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.478235359671	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.48888947205	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.480316628799	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.570750589234	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.479941352702	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.496688118443	This is not some small scale group.
1.0	0.481483025386	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.453229187437	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.494502803364	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.492733562482	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.481660477837	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.48307282632	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.436948431579	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.517433797861	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.472357466996	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.457710902033	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.498484461649	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.492407791312	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.398960105448	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.49845259289	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.393221836072	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.488671109666	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.526194324818	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.482286910328	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.480225108729	I win.
0.0	0.459693138894	It's not working.
0.0	0.459601454702	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.468140801384	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.527880968749	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.490862437857	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.532030944221	And loose money is one of the major problems.
1.0	0.50666587786	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
1.0	0.500021298494	They were wrong.
0.0	0.44690179745	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.463188133117	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.490649196343	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.450976262835	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.459919851059	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.470277337291	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.519472048276	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.453848487198	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.471720439633	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.456356742913	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.507818783685	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.470357768192	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.554584521716	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.489213690703	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.475847818867	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.498588030185	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.455067115024	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.492850480868	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.469487568876	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.495229860111	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.511344460333	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.488626362387	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.537380506578	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.487670176136	Came out great.
0.0	0.57686706605	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.45350283251	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.477560319724	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.462528515556	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.500130039467	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.476900841838	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.487343133223	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.548325888257	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.524767568713	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.507896518457	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.454802635935	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.530178304793	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.481505495967	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.471538874017	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.481469763949	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.471235271286	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.46470497484	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.45308530971	...
0.0	0.532725936834	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
1.0	0.451515909391	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.500334272874	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.450004019405	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.49671698516	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.51036445967	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.517391991214	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.438864479662	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.49570781014	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.479097901824	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.456548762762	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.479531216341	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
1.0	0.548615303775	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.465156475675	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.479097901824	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.512665824857	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.54868210244	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.436517563748	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.50184334138	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
1.0	0.553280903272	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.478844475604	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.482955930338	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.504099315075	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.428900125828	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.456501902989	That is not right.
0.0	0.488869599238	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.551620847763	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.456935367473	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.505364850061	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.529470337778	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.43942644259	I don't like that.
0.0	0.467818015259	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.477183753807	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.499597880495	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.517562424455	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.488871415302	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.510610783255	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.453759826824	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.469692259744	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.497327490672	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.487632948691	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.480487115582	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.449899234123	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.502905942378	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.55007487903	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.470228281379	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.451607071012	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.549612778286	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.480285224998	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.524160563702	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.481418662263	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.4845855121	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.507917480961	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.497947447824	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.494081202568	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.45442184275	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.482177557647	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.523691303258	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.492955342802	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.472703016225	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.473272322094	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.533066811903	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.477285971216	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.462736032708	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.451017137825	But...
0.0	0.472710446798	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
1.0	0.511789003821	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.480723382974	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.499153273016	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.530443046305	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.494001367274	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.452953983644	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.470651492669	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.499989139535	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.482198158362	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.489496421295	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.483473421991	That's fine.
0.0	0.527719579016	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.522572932384	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.555202067474	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.484916001812	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.492365866632	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
1.0	0.563372256932	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.512442874393	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.485037972537	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.480465930717	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.533683828361	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.465071634599	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.550659964441	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.482198158362	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.485430277203	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.558397473408	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.544845962703	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.484161786748	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.480388149747	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.503364280279	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.445894059814	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.542845697221	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.490927694959	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.48274715055	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.497528079961	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.451579634148	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.481352804218	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.510036895712	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.492719987224	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.459425314028	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.487793345509	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.476751815336	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.480745373784	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.452487024623	...John...
0.0	0.482176434238	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.478023937336	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.507886261516	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.484411879459	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.473886899342	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.490488107546	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.454330812727	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.495390454053	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.51059011605	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.543033305324	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.466981856518	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.52706018164	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.482198158362	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.480189422092	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.454550110281	About Medicare?
0.0	0.481629074036	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.51211293394	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.447176302039	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.490882302195	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.465754735482	I love this country.
0.0	0.496764426042	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.494717492645	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.446411517601	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.508765199229	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.495533394524	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.494843253058	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.493056222798	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
1.0	0.528432757777	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.467270981896	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.46798569359	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.474759582923	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.454942814197	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.563407285542	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.497893058976	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.45308530971	So...
1.0	0.477642350752	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.434476901328	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.496447400853	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.485634964928	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.477925781026	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.497642715762	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.506840633676	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.441890234199	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.482947832283	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.552046511709	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.495959529213	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.514199321544	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.548122796998	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.481963619512	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.477052504209	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.48888947205	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.483558182973	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.505291567324	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.486385440132	The world has changed.
0.0	0.504032055736	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.465040186368	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.460474829034	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.558429910489	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.483582362829	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.437903122168	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.500655549369	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.438795510287	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.480632552628	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.474842426027	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.480250889647	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.538005408006	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.500548250196	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.468532262343	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.471776510633	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.49009886401	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.480045191501	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.533021861749	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.519538178213	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.471330682853	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.47312988632	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.504269936078	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.505145260849	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.490588810014	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.493072667447	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.480086271505	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.545477001464	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.456353597496	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.459124054569	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.482642122754	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.495138284925	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.514546106153	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.511198634617	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.462994694165	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.482223288792	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.479345157303	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.474924649423	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.483507362657	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.479453563387	Not bad.
0.0	0.538339157769	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.530503142203	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.493238527794	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.488688119836	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.481660477837	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.481352804218	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.484137972376	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.453013031917	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.43193865639	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.453428089319	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.482229562162	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.424226240002	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.535193792176	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.474506604336	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.478261327242	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.464880383284	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.552099834929	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.48849859355	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.538909934782	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.451576744828	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.481657305345	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.476650491141	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.458559268764	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.544414756872	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.41702220709	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.463957227377	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.455197328211	...Thank you.
0.0	0.481986079064	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
1.0	0.534771111654	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.544996040578	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.499366208925	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.48166272739	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.464821898502	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.570936434802	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.45308530971	These...
0.0	0.4835694664	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.475358215256	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.479400357705	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.54064571553	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.428038202462	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.477272322506	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.523786730945	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.481486798719	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.436101850532	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.466184980694	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.482198158362	He's wrong.
0.0	0.528118467398	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.496755636345	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.501569584847	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.484071448249	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.482831814798	They're a scam.
0.0	0.455709715377	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.486924061775	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.479400357705	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.463824474893	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.499363138993	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.484171719036	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.513715685283	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.465121079046	We need sound money.
0.0	0.484368410967	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.479591452293	White people?
0.0	0.501880417076	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.480225108729	On welfare.
0.0	0.502368556687	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.518931988598	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
1.0	0.540593080782	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.52164239414	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.439303430797	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.484204774343	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.489308256649	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.453044434719	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.452968621601	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.501434253592	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.45202649606	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.525407929698	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.440156087147	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.483007743469	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.474780975655	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.538505116892	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
1.0	0.543532078	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.493287366218	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.484681682156	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.551232563452	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.434615145246	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.456501902989	That's not right.
0.0	0.529992390838	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.47487780934	What have you got now?
0.0	0.447246674256	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.474434698641	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.479698262818	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.493244269808	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.451367833965	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.482963934619	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.476361311901	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.525095798334	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.455062028797	And we are not England.
0.0	0.482748284893	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.535072868582	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.464984308119	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.470250795967	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.538715049534	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.455995872195	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.459937287609	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.479990663175	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.513308185014	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.492033259415	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.482984714835	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.530062687267	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.47674558828	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.513272189789	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.482485024346	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.55201693193	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.499822612685	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.490806265257	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.488868658678	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.45537573472	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.462396057471	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.444918935468	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.479233119935	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.518974394915	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.449857602181	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.450751494665	In all due respect...
0.0	0.475358553562	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.457130200682	They're off to China.
0.0	0.494699326723	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
1.0	0.51002232768	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.486908440814	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.4780932999	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.440209305616	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.440318300662	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.498264684988	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.490468816011	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.485257153686	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.478278344348	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.514783811021	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.452688801987	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.437927595058	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.483065847075	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.47497671739	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.453921812588	Illegal.
0.0	0.46851538063	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.496649175145	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.481629074036	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.478147491576	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.544906551237	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.512503058934	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.48756517535	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.510262398034	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.555946003432	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.551966178231	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.492922054142	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.50376208025	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.508851472696	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.478291957474	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.499919452358	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.542394923903	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.493505555548	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.502210455663	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.481605138929	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.46101062634	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.503933664932	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.548456151035	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.465001984308	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.495789257517	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.483418429331	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.477022139107	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.48149355216	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.467267446761	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.472970069713	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.470705007175	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.465121079046	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.440751552787	I like it.
0.0	0.479347701885	You find me...
0.0	0.506998968053	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.538566012318	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.465001110135	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.446949340787	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.484084250702	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.459943236012	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.49384742875	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.462607616924	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.487904340587	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.453557354958	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.456501902989	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.55053089951	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.460486286374	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.494310956198	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.545817113268	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.449903033394	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.480884546083	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.4349307652	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.505033796072	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.548340432648	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.483187515203	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.467676609945	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.494643184188	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.483558182973	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.501314342888	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.483436318235	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.502795471066	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.452366430998	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.497208360583	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.550158146446	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.489142589744	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.491205558093	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.500312392464	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.498500684817	This is 2016.
0.0	0.527801287072	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.485486269057	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.467641982027	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.484728149057	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.499596717094	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.481595905726	(inaudible).

0.0	0.49805590066	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.483272482767	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.483964016962	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.477937906112	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
1.0	0.482229562162	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.501181876455	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.479544194027	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.415567081631	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.482849345005	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.449565589293	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.496911084702	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.454550110281	No.
0.0	0.503125126206	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.510583293253	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.500866105452	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.530467121326	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.478575620544	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.496778412499	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.523035886094	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.476446770446	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.501488512519	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.

0.0	0.453215522897	Thank you.
0.0	0.478072157946	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.495131702907	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.461587242447	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
1.0	0.538876828666	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.453428089319	We can't do it.
0.0	0.524318393024	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.500278263666	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.494512598945	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.478299191292	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.489488247389	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.515091416654	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.482693925892	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.510235959395	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.50265338631	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.484859033174	You have to lead.
0.0	0.454263199916	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.453541058735	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.484355681711	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.493681602676	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.555222864413	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.39779806516	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.506917548867	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.513056630786	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
1.0	0.531091130815	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.41892531171	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.483700519815	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.477437576041	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.500213120729	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.480995279741	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.455579080378	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.448147579554	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.480597774866	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.452959368544	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.499896536594	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.436726520089	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.50224833262	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.433288762509	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.439303430797	You just want to...
0.0	0.471811566597	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.463730468865	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.441679991709	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.452487024623	...Chris...
1.0	0.520351505865	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.50199673176	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.474886802768	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.454550110281	Okay.
0.0	0.492324353917	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.44310952622	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.478841333642	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.457264890757	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.486178127876	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.491593487824	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.479832274281	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.497985951437	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.482052318699	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.4980488433	Both served.
0.0	0.497497582989	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.46048773611	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.519938493063	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.469275754396	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.488626362387	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.470662280063	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.480918881434	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.485698349895	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.501724500441	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.485045789855	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.509005160357	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.480111717348	And for good cause.
0.0	0.545305367198	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.477140808	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
1.0	0.496156290869	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.549945819499	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.496639390868	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.464413090461	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.479363625049	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.510015390891	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.492110373345	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.467018693302	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.464641560482	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.474452892367	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.454550110281	OK.
0.0	0.544905366295	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.519574386897	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.544959602022	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.520391410488	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.441033033169	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.47652281552	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.481599468254	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.494131240918	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.551826133049	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.463724445019	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.496945963702	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.442005982868	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.476133659884	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.497165859828	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.521003885333	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.503958062891	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.457327053794	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.507207895443	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.486669579493	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.496615385069	And this summer, we didn't do that.
1.0	0.501454288675	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.480060150429	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.49552573038	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.521558767709	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.462382906182	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.528817919188	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.491195833025	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.489086131873	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.534996593714	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.539359452652	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.497237903461	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.48699563006	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.476900024987	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.481660477837	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
1.0	0.518124618013	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.508994188832	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.473434665701	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.491192831865	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.507082403057	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.482189482174	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.452007604015	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
1.0	0.482968978274	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.493867457812	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.509306961235	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.471412799124	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.476219054977	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.454400376767	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.496164584218	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.504032055736	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.49868595621	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.514258571004	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.454550110281	Right.
0.0	0.482823138611	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.483632383359	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.512369579559	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.505813183956	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.537235441611	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.488196092997	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.503242276487	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.49541554975	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.432371806764	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.453428089319	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.479400602428	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.46375698793	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.456984967585	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.481494749476	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.453215522897	Say again?
0.0	0.499742694315	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.436458257579	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.457157513302	It's true.
0.0	0.547245430092	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.483632383359	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.483483951804	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.500361358052	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.479834391897	No, it should be repealed.
1.0	0.502870828473	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.453215522897	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.479097901824	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.503282914462	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.495144410557	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.500021298494	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.419789420074	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.466221664037	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.458635331189	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.47487780934	She was right.
0.0	0.554344581474	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.481629074036	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.453428089319	I'll say this.
0.0	0.52497057835	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.485045535895	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.482006158099	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.48804520747	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.471387952487	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.495959529213	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.483139593238	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.451963288748	I would just say that...
0.0	0.450761653783	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.488626362387	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.473932295413	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.505748249802	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.491157601408	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.519094469628	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.452301346984	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.494588322081	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.496538105752	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.472171369823	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.479483341645	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.480111717348	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.534545343624	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.446708863159	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.448729203568	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
1.0	0.51100421022	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.502830866983	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.483558182973	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.487769113764	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.523095470082	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.4705164404	That's my view.
0.0	0.482654165567	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.49671859711	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.504636547984	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.44522160554	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.484909658644	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.499367942045	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.464483628176	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.50331269591	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.485909625275	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.464416705779	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.501992663285	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.481008943546	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.442725366689	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.47729212459	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.441823802225	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.493685403477	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.499544845099	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.449827007242	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.536044161593	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.526977646653	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.502492292705	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.500655549369	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.489437672227	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.515404271224	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.489730742763	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.427431012097	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
1.0	0.525756778726	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.46075889753	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.483785544004	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.482001838609	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.457130200682	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.493578610739	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.447332691741	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.478653853499	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.457611875678	...No, sir...
0.0	0.437944227004	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.482924526537	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.504288253788	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.455795613298	You don't have to.
0.0	0.448070681212	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.454288571028	And you know what?
0.0	0.50727374123	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.479189829727	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.485904059706	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.511906617898	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.484171719036	I'm tested.
0.0	0.461762693882	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.486978001586	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.49687871872	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.45572844522	That's for sure.
0.0	0.443979623702	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.476042489531	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.486941041806	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.523464141865	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.454550110281	Yeah.
0.0	0.501388847013	They were wrong.
0.0	0.511449299632	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.47487780934	I didn't.
0.0	0.437471506963	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.464011972728	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.49601408506	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.502265436041	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.473825934637	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.537580514984	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.501439556136	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.45308530971	...
0.0	0.482884249353	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.437078945244	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.486861340971	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.504585501394	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.47716081204	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.457275412098	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.442458904645	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.49896158525	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.500086740156	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.480573308118	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.498484374302	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.483700519815	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.47310373039	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.497234792842	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.476192187298	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.525107139193	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.456402222771	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.395682390768	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.454550110281	We do.
0.0	0.476413662656	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.482871169355	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.44464125896	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.493282893852	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
1.0	0.499240280031	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.474759582923	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.427392161152	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
1.0	0.556275842804	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.420559672593	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.453428089319	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.521570854302	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.454550110281	Alright.
0.0	0.463000906894	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.452255561759	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.461812834454	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.482345568639	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.503795062677	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.510668046841	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.514417296753	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.498074378841	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.467603567161	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.493100000462	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.484917728963	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.497684012072	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.553055012163	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.389553344921	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.475668729886	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.488377741328	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.47487780934	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.452481938396	And why?
0.0	0.480826712465	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.540924051073	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.483503186134	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.519206142765	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.49752785287	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.466365327694	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.560757460338	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.455022155529	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.500021298494	We were wrong.
0.0	0.435931959093	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.485565048058	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.479325929706	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.495008763954	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.503951954996	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.486913962833	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.507835603904	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.477494072991	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.459059482458	They look around for gun-free zones.
1.0	0.57244899755	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.504032055736	She voted for it.
0.0	0.426221986987	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.481629074036	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.470904867091	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.525356938112	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.527649218268	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.498565131603	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.487543294442	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.480465930717	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.456245487846	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.462836568836	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.484187198019	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.465001984308	Of course not.
0.0	0.484411879459	He is a good man.
0.0	0.453776842907	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.456856454831	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.402533884733	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.441685734972	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.471688116018	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.454762676703	So you might not.
0.0	0.453215522897	Thank you.
0.0	0.529205611874	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.496258307244	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.49670793707	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.459050806271	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.502602592181	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.47753766317	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.492614555887	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.456531915595	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.542887982485	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?

0.0	0.491623763973	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.

0.0	0.500778961181	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.487574639768	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
1.0	0.54743889398	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.468476934882	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.488497834838	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.49922446465	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.463585090509	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.480465930717	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.452205950988	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.473159437511	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.483473421991	That's fine.
0.0	0.49971964986	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.461706300223	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.487291340074	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.51381444815	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.

0.0	0.505811092623	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.465972214425	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.469195838316	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.522823546532	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.482839765555	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.455141121773	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.457130200682	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.474899443341	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.522962843646	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.497996626073	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.549858375179	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.524236725259	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.495930905404	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.523239266411	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.463758048827	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.528902045479	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.491957163314	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.552190919726	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
1.0	0.524958311341	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.482262730472	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.573834842906	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.456531915595	No, no.
0.0	0.493282021078	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.454920809353	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.395010962314	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.501845556521	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
1.0	0.467614441287	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.499294754235	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.499667765849	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.507307269193	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.

0.0	0.482831814798	I have no idea.
0.0	0.469973011131	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.52910709068	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.476714813154	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.483549146973	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.493439796482	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.4670321032	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.482262730472	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.483873866863	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.44381063625	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.

0.0	0.454550110281	OK?
0.0	0.464919776631	I am passionate about what I believe.
1.0	0.494155330151	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.49631736266	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.484790896718	That is beyond unspeakable.

0.0	0.496909540117	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.

0.0	0.444697095821	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.479097901824	We can't do this unilaterally.

0.0	0.403967043566	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.509714340911	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.4810268214	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.477956953708	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.

0.0	0.459693138894	The answer is no.
0.0	0.507734866884	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.

0.0	0.456356742913	You know why?

0.0	0.458348122815	Do we have answer for that?

0.0	0.504305082272	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.480141417311	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.

0.0	0.507253779209	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.45192896358	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.54930368015	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.516478322068	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.

0.0	0.496300501608	You know why three?
0.0	0.459994001334	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.518864992825	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.471766320222	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.518637633124	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.477868410995	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.495754356479	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.509779615859	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.

0.0	0.540811947802	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.476976801601	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."

0.0	0.439393945938	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.442005982868	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.47487780934	That's what I said.
0.0	0.459876569226	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.528532918333	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.46995229596	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.509675222563	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.496916675454	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.442108897214	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
1.0	0.492595493264	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.454288571028	But you know what?
0.0	0.45572844522	You're welcome.
0.0	0.485537887119	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.492922054142	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.496300501608	You know why three?
0.0	0.541033903534	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.495297581991	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.478705814382	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.491499295018	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.497039325706	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.494312350131	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.490130753468	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.461759179565	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.483045379473	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.473264684754	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.482182520259	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.504861875103	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.485600350554	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.50713345224	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.48620260319	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.478723115249	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.500956315422	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
1.0	0.527092215998	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.50736952782	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.47427545014	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.483857143191	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.478348008908	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.437594070884	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.477925781026	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.507084169938	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.523019816704	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.507781599205	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.450104696143	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.567580197569	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.453651558395	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.494690806706	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.503683691816	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.461563817532	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.488303317837	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.476447608134	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.455067115024	No -- no...
0.0	0.422874978566	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.434853744209	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.489085445474	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.473518412073	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.482432006759	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.457785810995	I agree with them.
0.0	0.459780664808	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.456040728501	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.426919255431	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.506042832237	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.502045273531	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.43942644259	They don't like that.
0.0	0.467605043382	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.471668211678	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
1.0	0.482831814798	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.486764309322	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.477574503867	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.484089674994	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.47487780934	I said no.
0.0	0.479351205156	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.455093670188	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.47879462863	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.454550110281	Right.
0.0	0.480884546083	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.522930793869	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.479332221249	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.45308530971	I have...
0.0	0.472363132045	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
1.0	0.574536911413	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.524195853442	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.488056838529	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.481412868708	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.470194065129	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.474899148194	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.481418662263	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.447183970645	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
1.0	0.542832596566	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.471455553485	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.48309826718	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.509352213378	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
1.0	0.565708259677	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.481486798719	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.503148493671	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.482831814798	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.415758023674	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.46502650793	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.459837538709	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.469931581911	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.512778638002	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.490667970772	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.495153688525	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.505770010249	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.485570392817	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.505888116998	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.491623763973	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.438401734066	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.476647204165	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.470071473564	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.497672724144	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.485554262892	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.425042269705	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.471319378359	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.479395487806	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.481078284582	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.459151241093	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.547827137444	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.464984308119	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.440751552787	That's what we need.
0.0	0.49930919289	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.492698701353	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.455104577964	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.480715580593	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.454401240442	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.475985716932	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.478075365664	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.487547619269	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.511832984906	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.480599895366	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.474755154914	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.475976851492	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.484411879459	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.47496023919	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.452446149633	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.481595905726	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.484827521819	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.493975108462	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.452262640842	And so do I.
0.0	0.457130200682	Why is that?
0.0	0.455758457827	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.513758910697	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.485539747929	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.46127246739	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.511390087901	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.479544194027	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.522045903367	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.476314162693	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.456356742913	You know why?
0.0	0.458001306074	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
1.0	0.55590873477	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.504868643668	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.473742448521	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.486330881499	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.419751709097	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.498311639038	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.489193783723	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.464246341068	And God bless America.
0.0	0.482331802417	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.481750529492	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.464344118659	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.461706300223	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.508755164451	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.481630012746	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.463748068138	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.494767908735	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.508757733655	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.48348341119	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.457957016128	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.507640730245	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.488266184094	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.51685988932	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.4504342276	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.440171757116	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.487332745826	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.498600356962	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.448766117992	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.456531915595	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.481348909812	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.464847168176	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.466689796569	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.547422872406	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.478938113477	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.489121970114	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.49418738397	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.465470966604	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.503502932498	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.483630759366	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.513762503215	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.457130200682	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.512855621118	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.533438005566	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.483066863379	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.531559131167	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.534725524184	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.447431939913	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.454550110281	No.
0.0	0.464890245032	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.48543625369	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.496968418675	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.48687280355	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.504855593848	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.451017137825	And...
0.0	0.479332221249	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.501384868319	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.

0.0	0.479087280272	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.492818047633	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.480839646528	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.492183715459	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.

0.0	0.48337852426	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.481595905726	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.496593185649	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.457724653547	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.

0.0	0.482839765555	I'm ready.
0.0	0.450762316293	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.

0.0	0.4810268214	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.455197328211	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.570075553936	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.447826290894	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.497960967865	No one here is under FBI investigation.

0.0	0.480764464996	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.467421151933	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.484171719036	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.455487451742	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.482831814798	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.47427545014	Well, I did.
0.0	0.491198573964	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.468036920262	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.426410105192	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.

0.0	0.483591317686	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.497149862265	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.501698301687	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.461619603985	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.485378768714	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.464416705779	We need to bring people together in Washington.

0.0	0.549169385681	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.497230479358	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.512680428162	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.481629074036	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.482325438445	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.493475471534	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.463015965561	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.512829979108	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.476415366645	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.439829110109	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
1.0	0.48360263471	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.492770136367	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.489333188614	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.52468007485	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.490018026028	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.492872909578	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.476042489531	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.464350781529	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.481120772018	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.432246213576	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.453215522897	Thank you.
0.0	0.549672483557	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.438834905242	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.525178313226	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.492507977822	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.500331410591	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.453428089319	You can have him.
0.0	0.499685149935	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.493439467539	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.46937794879	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.491550691915	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.50827884857	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.499906313994	But I was born here.
0.0	0.496215263729	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.492831877879	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.503405419816	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.488089240701	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.464522819239	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.454550110281	No.
0.0	0.491680268113	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.554458414951	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.513687715104	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.49542093272	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.498565131603	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.482198158362	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.481629074036	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.482198158362	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.478833412222	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.467415071863	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.546574242309	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.534310536202	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.483407631266	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.48939935492	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.479583401363	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.466407373022	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.502091248817	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.433628670331	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.481483025386	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.445671870047	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.480224459829	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.478893544855	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.457867023342	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.508439621064	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.457077604503	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.418512098508	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.481629074036	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.485039262525	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.521254569588	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.450853653456	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.485045535895	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.47487780934	I never said that.
0.0	0.47487780934	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.462905593011	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.476002004174	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.476445816639	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.497301473081	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.479332221249	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.448417535118	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.487383621497	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.475553668508	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.472442535111	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.503367148354	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.432311744776	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
1.0	0.48623831478	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.484380188555	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.485045535895	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.484859033174	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.524356035523	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.529008007724	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.400961976445	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.455795613298	We have to do something.
0.0	0.462313886582	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.458279986359	It feels different.
0.0	0.491348767854	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.489515287874	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.487123823934	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.53928226964	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.536314143392	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.505896445085	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.491551853481	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.542701790515	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
1.0	0.482215688569	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.479097901824	I would change them.
0.0	0.487793450146	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.531675607607	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.494787276284	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.450855116668	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.510627016809	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.480632552628	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.537594326693	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.479478164703	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.416340664926	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.511661783684	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
