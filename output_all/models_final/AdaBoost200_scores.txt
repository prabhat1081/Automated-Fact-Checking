0.0	0.498897625184	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.500839062821	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.460326374021	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.497483022549	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.498702689563	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.494177228367	But...
0.0	0.496482138891	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.504609551722	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.45810433615	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.484342498484	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.501587973184	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.502007594652	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.498799659394	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.498097378668	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.499220260431	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.453059606633	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.453645983534	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.494666108514	I have...
0.0	0.494994700437	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.498507297643	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.497663146204	I promise.
0.0	0.498854720067	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.497420026929	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.503678380145	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.499529267812	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.543702891613	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.503101784437	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
1.0	0.49729217308	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.500745514161	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.476114606344	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.496807348271	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.495892848642	I understand.
0.0	0.496960709367	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.496567027009	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.495325388044	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.497968289586	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.499051027275	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.501648116061	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.500493549823	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.495490483246	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.496510215151	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.503060135577	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.495323869087	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.495060529864	So...
0.0	0.500960595347	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
1.0	0.506760919413	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.496215978196	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.503764377671	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.49905808748	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.495996664266	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.496872009409	I'll say this.
0.0	0.473745914275	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.497011755283	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.495658146042	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.506944662055	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.456363118551	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.497182184482	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.499848599322	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.498512334145	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.460866767666	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.495366529266	It is.
0.0	0.501719444756	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.498272132726	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.50042328285	He hit oil.
0.0	0.498650923818	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.499753018715	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.500760261965	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.512455230403	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.497720287566	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.500756887824	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.494535509323	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.498021456202	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.498200964291	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.500172681168	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.499300024357	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.445535827724	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.504038199019	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.496890178641	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.495731306852	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.494405270711	OK?
0.0	0.454353853683	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.49404534586	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.494375620224	No -- no...
0.0	0.499203751109	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.500556491063	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.501882268214	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.499344852218	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.542447877618	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.50240406278	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.499069371774	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.497687415794	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.499334869736	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.49718530003	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.494022401332	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.497308703241	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.493725047577	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.504019367609	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.496971058941	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.502229136918	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.50109215172	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.451023797697	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.499201351438	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.494087135479	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.498559383189	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.499806415264	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.502847162793	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.500256378418	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.50020373112	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.542747234586	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.498220532489	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.498118206918	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.499555922645	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.503252329098	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.502903669883	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.498951634761	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.498251956969	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.45185374014	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.5053275685	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.522500351585	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.454083553198	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.553510677813	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.49377882016	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.497759615989	Think about it.
0.0	0.453403684255	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.513063784049	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.516749184818	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.50104360628	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.499694723869	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.501519708054	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
1.0	0.476405316387	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.494405270711	Yeah.
0.0	0.497968289586	But I would add this.
1.0	0.506975228172	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
1.0	0.548259681971	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.497088910728	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.492231005209	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.518102061754	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.553088862764	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.497700236975	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.499693129144	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
1.0	0.503266154988	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.497195695583	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.502745703439	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.453771086479	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
1.0	0.580681288629	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.506083053095	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.498815003415	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.499350700515	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.456976149583	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.496143049684	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.503437342414	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.448731826266	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.496037974997	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.495756484608	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.502602994144	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.49509413169	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.500533609072	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.508870246375	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.50161606168	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.481411465436	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.455324823688	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.496211735568	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.50238971648	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.428129868168	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.490575769089	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.498866153823	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.501284093742	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.499332031542	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.541751963708	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.500761723815	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.475764272788	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.498418543082	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.496506406655	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.504281979876	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.501785024674	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.503581090381	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.495459063848	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.496276211438	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.494666108514	...
0.0	0.496679965	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.49608077363	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.496907379864	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.496010166334	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.504351483916	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.497867017978	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.497158657518	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.49868456388	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.493547015396	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.494439431267	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.503337560952	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.499263176033	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.501642163442	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.49677320384	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.493833292526	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.502701462628	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.494197814361	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.493497771153	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.497668215517	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.497794432567	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.498690666972	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.500401713188	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.496294097086	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.513044750017	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.45180782142	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.500485997939	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.500648536977	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.501054308946	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.51130584722	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.505659098879	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.496555004402	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.503715656334	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.484523521569	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.51255421375	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.494388731753	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.45702312456	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.498604231102	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.491476969946	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.499818925614	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.499153163207	Maria, let me clear something up here.
1.0	0.545963461838	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.499005694398	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.497296781733	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.494177228367	And...
0.0	0.499629519698	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.498187201819	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.500757926051	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.456827696781	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
1.0	0.502714017527	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.500791137714	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.504766224277	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.50056210662	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.499259295866	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.452831324104	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.495169790111	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.503720010349	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.498828492342	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.509170097684	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.4968162422	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.485728577578	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.456181660816	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.499658594618	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.543425549215	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.499948827501	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.498363566986	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.476111697152	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.548565800056	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.489561226366	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.508050601222	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.49703726831	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.498678966682	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.49996423324	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.49949506662	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.503754994852	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.496128143046	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.499606704877	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.499044681763	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.452084778238	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
1.0	0.498560596011	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.500127958514	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.499912023162	Both served.
0.0	0.503002822508	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.501791150837	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.496255872985	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.499689326098	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.452168066796	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.457583131893	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.499315227734	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.506186443399	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.502986578464	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.463364577899	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.497975008165	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.498290104509	He does great.
0.0	0.496319852175	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.500505280243	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.513869654074	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.499771634341	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.521330138182	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.502385901318	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.496486067777	I love China.
0.0	0.495776768298	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.498909523281	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.502150503025	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.49572174003	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.500231942253	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.497570547311	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.516564846952	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.499476578356	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.49983497289	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.498162349535	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.496108963084	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.496629653068	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.499174853826	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.496004441588	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.496077958784	Illegal.
0.0	0.499783263939	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.503761466568	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.523280050146	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.497095165797	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.448962596372	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.495397656327	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.498156709288	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.507101085044	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.505134251693	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.499719191376	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.496995580249	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.497461806742	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.50157103106	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.504667359444	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.460038438776	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.49944378745	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.497973921651	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.458365468318	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.498569839815	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.500905227281	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
1.0	0.503231069383	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.497964115707	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.493893043508	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.451598221614	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.497910324291	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.498439757564	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.487771259086	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.514285738378	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.494984304689	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.499025708512	They cause dishonesty.
1.0	0.509971952996	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.522486039802	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.498970260722	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.499109278026	Here's a fact.
1.0	0.496643050135	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.497462536014	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.498283160541	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.497275468765	How about this?
0.0	0.452708837045	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.500164161784	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.498415989027	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.483741654502	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.498398171652	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.497416351706	So you know what?
0.0	0.497416351706	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.477444216358	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.49920006769	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.491942507503	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.499426296049	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.501966510601	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.502691018817	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.499508500058	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.49836004572	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.499005694398	That's the difference.
0.0	0.498318718879	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.497310556369	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.506871146548	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.493219345175	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.498460586857	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.443200643783	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.499132020782	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.500786869861	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.50068028003	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.49744039283	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.494641018007	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.496486593399	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.544410055278	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.497042109644	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.49906530462	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.50134974716	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.495671267344	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.504127943807	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.499071928335	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.493308562951	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.497750975253	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.49637623231	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.499739454922	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.495854554416	I would just say that...
0.0	0.498344975698	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.500953035743	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.499109278026	That's not true.
0.0	0.456605100698	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.497749840164	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.491533131127	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.503550650591	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.500691036287	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.498585651775	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.494097681522	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.496966545632	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.502608885095	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.497448809605	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.505553230296	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.502831961894	We put in place child care support.

0.0	0.496472399874	Ever.
0.0	0.496719823105	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.503070555425	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.496927426343	And you know what?
0.0	0.498310465327	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.505294757274	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.505389195005	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
1.0	0.500100782834	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.475389580689	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.499430294191	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.498501110227	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.489744425205	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.501332879125	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.498190697301	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.500302693269	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.496008621165	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.500672195704	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.497273604017	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.497266458838	I will not do that.
0.0	0.497877557295	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
1.0	0.504901501394	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.495337811603	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.500680694208	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.486180713522	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.450784965793	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.485895602933	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.498997601934	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.475639059228	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.497811791316	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.499888972302	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1.0	0.500164410862	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.497717599783	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.499191159647	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.497964074998	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.495759853811	John.
0.0	0.492338269197	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.503453177121	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.49583831584	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.495108115097	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.497313484111	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.496908974697	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.498213321138	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
1.0	0.500553196654	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.498178176326	His family certainly believes that.
1.0	0.497783719776	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.498430178268	She was right.
0.0	0.49505374874	And why?
0.0	0.501471163982	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.493844547632	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.49757673173	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.497099342539	That's not right.
0.0	0.499055888372	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.546836338195	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.500261561807	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.501226768055	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.502052479469	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.496935388875	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.497313707737	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.504746395459	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.50113315004	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.495338340529	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.496077958784	No.
0.0	0.495194802917	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.503130390437	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.501501528617	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.496704894699	That's right.
0.0	0.498960356831	The economy was really booming.
1.0	0.543158323803	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.503409881238	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.498680321039	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.498858133514	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.496086818047	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.476111697152	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.498421814308	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.49606175877	That has not been...
0.0	0.502471338992	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.493549493577	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.500927082083	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.521356002012	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.493311749367	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.455439926256	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.497617090631	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.485550186541	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.497099342539	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.491294742974	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.49905890146	The problem is we never get it done.
1.0	0.503295773268	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.454027752477	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.5334139825	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.498926900048	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.500930985842	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.502952463107	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.45236753065	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.50203186798	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.505122151598	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.500020601306	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.501289291611	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.53647110934	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.495168433151	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.48841135103	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.455524877548	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.501884615896	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.497810805702	You're right.
0.0	0.50480633452	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.541442185231	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.498370060426	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
1.0	0.501531793892	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.521419288884	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.498624565232	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.496303598132	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.501492345158	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.497317964938	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.499344852218	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.454217702101	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.502170854529	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.452452057397	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.496761547956	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.497970907511	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.513027832546	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.503837116688	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.497403088873	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.498528299803	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.500722711191	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.501879290467	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.497296117542	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.498324575972	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.498001086252	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.501348010149	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.498034004407	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.49875031532	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.5001172849	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.49822398572	Our next president...
0.0	0.496777717127	I've laid out...
0.0	0.499774947574	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.496996463694	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.501101743435	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.500114534046	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.501160126086	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.493232558608	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.503014959882	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.501325397836	Just for the record.
0.0	0.498124683439	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.498972145928	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.4977934391	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.520831189012	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.498114472076	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.492909383481	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.499162459062	He's wrong.
0.0	0.496924146488	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.496472399874	Right.
0.0	0.498043011417	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.500429147117	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.497117684949	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.498046711076	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.437196178937	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.498218533095	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.48528490175	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.496872009409	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.520709324326	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.49979822876	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.495086945801	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.500567381903	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.496652096465	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.502869342986	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.498714816912	That's fine.
0.0	0.49562616798	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.490780795828	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.49938169933	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.496744075447	...before I go.
0.0	0.501908199268	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.496965517389	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.49870851662	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.499389073399	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.498696683229	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.499239054151	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.497828413885	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.496213542583	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.500396909806	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.500180708241	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.499194928251	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.496389362807	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.520080733926	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.498903242844	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.49644905626	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.495186459863	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.500494457235	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.511458418584	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.518938416005	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.503696165091	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.500493042706	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.500759618453	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.496704894699	That's what he is.
0.0	0.496312891455	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.495149799684	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.497921495139	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.515619046032	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
1.0	0.502344493523	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.49938725574	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.496794682084	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.452011214702	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.488837205179	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.491575919836	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.552004742527	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.461599148626	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.50188857264	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.498209098371	We need sound money.
0.0	0.501064513453	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.453677831243	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.496766137839	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.50178210436	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.500794644799	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.497205742916	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.544899517073	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.495020178811	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.496872009409	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.50230131074	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.492911535343	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.500148392591	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.475102935007	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.499249215848	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.500142343004	A brief response.
0.0	0.49849888743	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.508401714375	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.496697307772	You did.
0.0	0.49838670732	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.49572560961	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.479240133893	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.498370149127	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.485733840637	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.500077116205	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.514356736776	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
1.0	0.498754908869	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.499211271212	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.499518057137	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.494874945458	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.500053377472	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
1.0	0.49643663666	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.499075599326	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.494769625444	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.475718149468	It feels different.
0.0	0.502930044338	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.477782272158	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.498430178268	I never said that.
0.0	0.496484391909	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.496169572018	Why is that?
0.0	0.498838461351	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.499717626799	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.496556984307	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.500673239317	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.501581381281	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.500936921453	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.47839861845	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.498159276765	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.501957723394	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.494405270711	OK?
0.0	0.497545923109	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.50006465456	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.499499245649	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.500116203297	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.542543802006	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.500158000231	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.499455465431	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.497717599783	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.501668693171	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.499602008287	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.511898795413	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.496394316763	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.496139658173	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.503554384045	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.504483137364	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.497810805702	Well, sure.
0.0	0.497810805702	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.497928922926	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.501832852589	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.512604358934	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.496060616405	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.496390808606	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.499696139154	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.495073706999	You just want to...
0.0	0.497810805702	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.497818277721	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.499619923122	I love this country.
0.0	0.499824460487	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.495232079641	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.510240117928	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.496850890749	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.500329630518	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.49986957409	Two points.
0.0	0.498899861653	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.452650540303	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.498851128198	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.499620961028	I changed that.
0.0	0.496751160593	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.499444148996	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.506779919128	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.517648238298	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.518199594225	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.496416253033	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.498602712555	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.500922042147	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.498434915955	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.502214547794	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.495944908681	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.503939898254	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.498045636887	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.489347614421	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.499899521709	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.527442555029	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
1.0	0.501165312813	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.49852844567	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
1.0	0.492525409426	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.500516432562	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.498740117596	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.496077958784	No.
0.0	0.500992717006	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.50122683394	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.455911594914	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.499610719875	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.501226768055	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.498886432253	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.504424794137	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.500144047424	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.475354027264	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.500651506407	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.501375254136	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.497161217858	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.505995895301	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.497416351706	Check it out.
0.0	0.49688318519	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.499620961028	They were wrong.
0.0	0.499832765455	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.500034043553	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.495452143638	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.53756325554	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
1.0	0.502522751905	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.496360139036	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.495498852924	No vision at all.
0.0	0.493954534055	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.49988099544	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.502978599511	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.500008688974	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.499722128754	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.504956237395	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.495201697505	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.495129428793	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.498589899504	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.496897154539	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.49987194107	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.542288201734	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.506332352165	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.499846061245	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.50023213417	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.494244610207	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.496959072119	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.500489840938	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.47819992469	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.491754350525	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.498687409645	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.500763457092	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.501932160055	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.50202131364	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.501816762411	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.5000919754	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.495552487448	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.497821773712	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
1.0	0.496492545217	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.509362622952	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.512633629323	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.498112055904	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.499521405197	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.504705664052	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.500819572728	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.498878763788	On welfare.
0.0	0.5006310918	I have no idea.
0.0	0.491337169438	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.501159600054	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.497662110561	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.496087113328	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.493208356074	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.502135850082	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.504500100979	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.483033337889	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.504057203045	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.49758805411	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.504477591304	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.565190261686	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.502848292829	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.493853720559	I want security.
0.0	0.501444693462	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.483438996918	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.45386429236	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.499203489764	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.497021113248	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.501713826383	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.499175189652	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.498366440479	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.

0.0	0.497783719776	My point is this.
0.0	0.497290572959	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.49217947727	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.

0.0	0.499099685513	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.453872924225	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.513114306281	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.

0.0	0.505083513354	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.54889373389	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.497679948463	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.500655523758	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.

0.0	0.499249302497	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.495237801119	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.478791022266	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.500005812635	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.504846649376	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.498430178268	I didn't.
0.0	0.499222394918	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.536786650405	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.510566054512	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.501603003297	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.496138724682	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.497045857065	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.499804499664	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.503071920166	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.49583930811	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.497538565292	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
1.0	0.50021856493	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.497102258288	We have to do something.
0.0	0.499230034629	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.459363044388	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.512033362918	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.500816119391	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.49945093809	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.497536906787	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.459125421141	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.497759615989	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.499530474262	Number one, you have people in this country that...

0.0	0.500842360791	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.499821153874	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.51983690745	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.49582683933	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.502200943281	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.499203489764	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.446526191999	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.497532383919	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.4986317439	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.499753079491	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.500310549761	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.502738685868	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.50413738478	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.453755100831	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.499652970095	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.511918907496	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.499075957486	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.50019567797	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.494597314561	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.505869922895	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.496894569801	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.501150423572	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.492002420609	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.508805525741	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.49868810524	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.503738996805	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.500685592917	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.

0.0	0.503508451843	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.50559698413	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.495193489956	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?

0.0	0.499820758808	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.501051761293	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.501169812672	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.498783854098	Our vets are being treated horribly.

0.0	0.484672875998	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.483057217242	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.540573851198	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.456912192982	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.495844475599	...income tax...
0.0	0.499879573417	We will win on everything we do.

0.0	0.445321237687	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.499001580886	You bet they do.
0.0	0.499279276987	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
1.0	0.501342157086	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.506373079018	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.498831561079	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.495994516642	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.498883956358	Eleven points, to be exact.

0.0	0.498609795452	She said the truth.
0.0	0.494238247204	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.504063882667	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.56656587272	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.497358206012	You want to fix Medicare?

0.0	0.500150954347	We're running.

0.0	0.497051252599	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.474072592539	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.495860894068	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.495781166345	And here's why.
0.0	0.492027626383	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.49978681659	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.46891132068	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.492659715938	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.511786684667	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
1.0	0.503724721994	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.497772612627	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.498231999494	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.499251113737	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.45450600126	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.499229814037	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.501401268966	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.478206061624	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.495108796124	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.495759853811	Alright.
0.0	0.497981010156	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.496204930828	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.453536314824	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.501557596549	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.4982156984	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.497581716197	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.498341011251	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.49804691544	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.503576046387	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
1.0	0.498470834948	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.502070921839	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.457481248705	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.501233168063	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.497098235111	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.500288901517	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.497675944301	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.496839724387	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.49942617468	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.50004178342	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.498533264539	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.50138613528	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.502059144061	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.498051520476	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.504068977027	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.500571129952	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.497648304293	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.496535653379	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.508216082061	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.454706447023	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.501025553699	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.496535655415	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.49042997761	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.530525815789	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.501408076064	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.498995722557	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.499646107121	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.495465835301	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.498623024868	We can't do it.
0.0	0.500057812506	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.501158746047	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.499793170716	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.497403830121	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.524214469138	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.498470579793	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.498158585797	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.540283062051	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.500907570142	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.498384879093	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.497492957149	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.462934478815	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.504108371027	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.490649474884	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.498958468688	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.526837567145	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.510602541561	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.495335281588	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.491856049557	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.498457224345	I would change them.
0.0	0.503156443992	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.495117165315	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.497994824547	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.499887607504	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.496059703284	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.496834807982	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.499617174422	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.501864930503	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.50000666957	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
1.0	0.501201836084	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.500980293268	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.499403601895	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.500263209992	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.49986750931	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
1.0	0.499643910142	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.496062494213	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.512464114688	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.494405270711	Yeah.
0.0	0.496159574872	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.497047506731	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.501892735862	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.499866112158	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.501022321866	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.541452933703	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.495500884426	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.49848661786	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.499030750191	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.498904542151	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.531036473523	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.500551016143	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.498773447854	I was not at all.
1.0	0.495765797343	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.501642723631	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.49663362206	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.498042714202	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.499426296049	I'm ready.
0.0	0.512148875272	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.496744075447	...Thank you.
0.0	0.502983850205	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.49780657251	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.454110154779	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.498676483329	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.499265745818	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.491965375052	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.496686262163	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.498430178268	I never said that.
0.0	0.516950206464	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.488861237718	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.502391901756	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.497175405291	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.497723266618	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.499430861538	He is a good man.
0.0	0.542966940991	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.507033638967	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.517486209225	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.495202337315	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.487905068221	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.496067810932	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
1.0	0.502414401526	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.500343008061	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.494666108514	...
0.0	0.50060467395	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.501301395235	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.497226515755	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.514535794425	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.

0.0	0.495125635316	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.517123534337	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.498422581837	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.499773211305	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.497762512224	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.496927426343	And guess what?
0.0	0.49929943182	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.

0.0	0.547023727357	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.497462727338	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.497947309627	Well, thank you very much.
1.0	0.498753324479	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.502228952584	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
1.0	0.497609386938	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.499516064225	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.49227142821	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.500257583272	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.493216248308	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.

0.0	0.499965262493	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.497361665958	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.499458704975	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.494244706886	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.498236117726	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.508465147437	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.495552596889	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.503994944695	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.500847101822	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.495672362732	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.504705751745	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.500060447087	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.494602698796	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.492717860481	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.509473449198	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
1.0	0.497791549661	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.505558716565	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.499975350377	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.497328104359	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.502407394406	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.452615253813	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.4951601757	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.498007246192	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.510412933618	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.500106956273	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.501291833715	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.4872045992	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.499186913625	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.499351552663	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.499845098743	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.499215523373	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
1.0	0.507391227946	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.451989758046	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.497927578049	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.501197497212	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
1.0	0.500064947253	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.543952819128	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.49749830735	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.534709381296	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.498024085092	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.542813674993	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.49733067929	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.497123095163	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.502079553338	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.500752941042	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.497263692589	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.501183973845	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.512769817345	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.498636157973	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.49809403643	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.519439545177	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.499361121438	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.498178063769	We cannot be the world's policeman.
1.0	0.521519366651	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.499717744444	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.49844430115	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.545421485929	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.501833324784	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.497598568211	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.494225353974	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.49570768244	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.498368070612	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.49021998529	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.520736768728	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.501456962501	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.493470509775	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.500027642549	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.500534268358	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.499089642093	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.494074943088	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.497141152516	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.494149434713	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.492581590788	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.492526289646	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.497753469774	OK, good.
0.0	0.498557573331	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.496817254778	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.496406415026	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.501601633774	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.492628410561	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.504016127451	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.472413477871	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.488711410773	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.515999203089	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.497593675662	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.501294069348	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.502958596834	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.492508865138	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.500273562761	You have to lead.
0.0	0.496472399874	Right.
0.0	0.49881946599	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.497291826528	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.499378816578	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.500142343004	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.49893795244	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.502499278485	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.50182236733	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.501226768055	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.487514459428	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.458504156593	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.49907650729	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.494672480391	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.498880282173	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.49842146704	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.500485615139	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.539711139039	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.498714816912	That is important.
0.0	0.474999608909	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.500510546171	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.502303404637	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.501113606191	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.502110212347	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
1.0	0.507136065695	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.49576828023	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.498500573038	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.504229751365	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.496136664585	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.503488077324	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.533235065505	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.494385534254	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.498607455632	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.496630407004	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.499022452489	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.496392100372	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.497588747865	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.495429453393	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.499557273001	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.498631090967	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.497270972178	I would change them.
0.0	0.502251407341	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.497069048151	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.499370155022	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.502574671739	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.496675154448	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.498154602187	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.499218724651	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.494411999107	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.496215978196	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.496388698065	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.500626398737	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.499494642906	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.485356083931	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.504761510583	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.507699983395	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.498634503258	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.496976124199	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.501029921895	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.499941515737	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.500945220642	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.502216541428	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.499607659618	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.499245042156	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.499712010458	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.497304425247	No their not.
0.0	0.477912518984	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.498242382958	They're a scam.
0.0	0.451631580532	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.49842232865	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.498425862523	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.494405270711	Okay.
0.0	0.501538554523	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.499864714901	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.496172153494	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.496103642006	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.497365614092	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.495983981595	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.498723584493	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.496362933117	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.496800779352	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.497647688771	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.497790682593	I've done it.
0.0	0.495077954784	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.491672701225	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.452051887486	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.498317141493	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.496872009409	I can do that.
1.0	0.492339602586	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.497006548168	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.498434691698	We were wrong.
0.0	0.497810805702	You're right.
1.0	0.505082103495	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.455769752977	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.504750293453	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.489219249334	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.502347246272	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.502175898507	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.49996254715	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.498767955775	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.498113610964	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.500965784392	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.499999765884	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.495598206124	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.542736211549	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.493636693897	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.500465209351	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.497094613582	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.500990836206	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.498256793467	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.500275656236	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.496206896509	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.49819272216	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.502008633908	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
1.0	0.494938452067	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.493307030875	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.500713185956	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.501852440014	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.498430178268	Well, I did.
0.0	0.452392679926	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.499787421064	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.499704756533	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.500294838531	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.495860894068	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.495234024896	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.500387690182	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.499842332294	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.500404531051	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.48646469811	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.497778185573	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.545917789571	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.495796144964	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.495916309385	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.476770522151	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.5068436643	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.4698591646	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.498035720213	No, you did.
0.0	0.502738205802	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.498575442211	Yeah, they are unhinged.
1.0	0.502947870683	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.508859083469	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.477138212398	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.499336383638	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.497003760355	And we are not England.
0.0	0.499811791974	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.498889221524	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.503772372167	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.491941835892	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.500500801406	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.516358608955	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.461765613168	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.497662453473	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.498892022456	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.500607734156	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.496749074846	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.496236874152	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.518591336772	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.499979117841	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.500452735591	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.498645888116	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.501459630655	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.498455104795	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.496881019253	How do I know this?
0.0	0.538463346035	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.50104345404	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.502232881915	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.497933835429	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.496490090891	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.496177692014	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.543785493389	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.501192469997	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.51206869636	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.505701132005	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.498694653055	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.499368979898	You count on it.
0.0	0.501394190195	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.502276495067	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.502548936242	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.499484745594	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.505368527293	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.496927426343	And you know what?
0.0	0.498768461759	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.500049429543	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.498117831621	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.456645662842	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.494006480315	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.504168415097	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.498335558205	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.502453461126	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.496384321378	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.493956523851	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.458914619722	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.495652943104	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.49800052733	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.498168270884	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.495732963933	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.495385245548	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.499469883709	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.45867626021	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.498847486915	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.496077958784	See?
0.0	0.502986694954	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.4987323629	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.500796461387	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.499329580286	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.524220861799	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.498967950221	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.518797638531	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.498743986142	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.501095748743	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.507015425484	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.498654799992	But we stuck to our message.
1.0	0.529008892836	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.502795767121	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.493590782156	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.496966534062	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.498723644211	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.496866339379	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.502637657828	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.498593439306	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.496561869364	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.49839887446	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.49959802636	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.498731321476	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.503935204651	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.497925368911	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.497690188513	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.501062617187	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.501416574515	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.510286802412	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.502087663245	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.498158400031	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.498730607119	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.501532506315	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.498847486915	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.498929230426	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.499430861538	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.454230240458	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.450320618624	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.503191462465	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.496077958784	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.503538437583	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.49681492159	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.501594586463	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.503364111018	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.452506642276	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.498005398391	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.501492074196	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.50523663367	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.458826712354	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.497633168655	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.495631712691	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.496898267636	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.496534190625	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.503667370166	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.497455308545	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
1.0	0.501005350379	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.503102816525	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.54341279464	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.462255281088	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.493147610267	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.49777387803	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.497149401177	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.499737823078	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.501031683745	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.489813154398	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.500582422504	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.49979516803	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.500730308817	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.496472399874	Dynamically.
0.0	0.498679556586	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.454374909392	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.500549009273	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.498242382958	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.50231139329	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.500522882699	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
1.0	0.499388801227	That's wrong.
0.0	0.544600142953	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.49786472836	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.502520883194	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.501387245461	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.498593439306	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.494405270711	Yes.
0.0	0.4985398938	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.524389528109	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.500648026978	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.498677483153	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.542066800857	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.500309237786	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.492251874105	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.497433715739	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.499592151356	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.502213209383	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.511800142221	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.466482922856	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.502594498129	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.455946406999	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.455188738471	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.500436978868	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.498258395119	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.500880077385	Well, let us level with the American people.
1.0	0.50446020703	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.496700070427	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.496757377429	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.496077958784	No.
1.0	0.493501190363	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.496823684918	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.498618480664	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.501475234896	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.499601729011	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.498225792207	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.4987244284	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.501226768055	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.495207999048	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.49662129041	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.518412722257	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.500999342796	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.503556596943	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.496566929882	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.49942931165	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.49835627081	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.45171953169	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.496096589624	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.497941243699	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.49608077363	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.484603292024	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.497592850485	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.504402158725	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.499603058107	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.478387175722	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.497861342413	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.499176791423	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.499496911982	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.495469268324	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.50320401888	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.497237295536	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.512904394478	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.494675753728	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.500724229023	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.498627796469	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.502085265173	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.497626001178	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.496495030442	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.499704443294	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.49692208244	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.497605190211	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.499336383638	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.498853266309	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.512536010947	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.451317265671	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
1.0	0.501369784823	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.497692623874	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.494420172702	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.498446422206	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.49334649724	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.511149735855	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.498770773451	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.495201697505	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.496774158995	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.504371249745	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.454911071816	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.502515244646	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.503764260351	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.495114394912	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.498301490817	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.497273693387	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.50166209274	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.497867757103	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.499441395028	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.499036239427	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.500809595675	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.496872009409	You can have him.
0.0	0.502494578262	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.499316681845	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.499389182525	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.496454029408	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.497183910208	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.494304935318	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.500816355011	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.49733067929	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.499089154593	The world has changed.
0.0	0.499469016425	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.500666470177	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.498024085092	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.497629348309	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.501504406097	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.501504446786	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.503697182167	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.498953610116	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.497124454856	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.498934822652	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.500256282334	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.499227025521	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.501015938245	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.501303709909	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.489677308793	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.502295542072	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.498299821584	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.501364617114	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.50310683491	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.490472356353	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.497884228076	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.559768819412	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.502546156932	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.497891182344	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.49689026252	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.497596981029	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.495956481131	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.454019812313	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.500382324059	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.49874655172	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.503931294306	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.498208901808	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.498851505178	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.494405270711	Yes.
0.0	0.496472399874	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.488483500475	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.494242431377	Big difference.
0.0	0.497224755878	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.5000708233	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.500527517277	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.499546010259	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.498717531449	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.498010664137	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.499500761397	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.499467418751	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.500406639916	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.506237705524	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.496927426343	And you know what?
0.0	0.499803475619	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.502959374421	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.495863563994	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.494405270711	OK.
0.0	0.497296098486	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.499194120789	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.498903242844	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.544422393346	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.49583933751	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.497497397016	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.500873300885	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.504304484919	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.546993827732	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.499698946998	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.497789303791	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.45786588889	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.497361073344	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.496799666332	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.496799666332	We don't need that.
0.0	0.493811353853	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.500377223978	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.500739829991	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.497484593663	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.499730225013	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.502394777139	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.498209098371	We need sound money.
0.0	0.502161973998	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.497296151795	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.453718656695	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.497405239216	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.498172514089	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.457752842058	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.500720817268	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
1.0	0.502487907941	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.498707359545	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.494653133032	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.496434389487	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.496927426343	And you know what?
0.0	0.498556502514	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.498049158786	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.504440797797	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.522166922162	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.502691142279	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.507177337999	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.498087951638	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.492428506246	...John...
0.0	0.495387387763	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.49993357203	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.503108208321	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.499737045166	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.488454421309	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.525387871445	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.49882599166	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.498720408036	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.497717599783	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.473867415068	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.453549894054	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.517991374642	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.497502839682	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.496593827098	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.50031407338	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.516791275105	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.502440623255	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.493367167116	Maria, I'd just like to say...
1.0	0.49819034642	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.498481462427	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.456875912763	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.498430178268	We actually did it.
0.0	0.496067300798	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.499320318144	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.489223017522	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.45436098139	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.491750278212	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.499183861466	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.544793237328	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.451668788815	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.502413032509	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.498714816912	That's fine.
0.0	0.456153005485	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.497903669313	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.49868456388	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.454932091284	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.502198645906	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.499784185009	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.500015423958	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.501060138443	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.498633943019	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.554785167709	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.502558509789	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.496456592841	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.496461328906	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.501158131365	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.539946040341	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.496582231011	And so do I.
0.0	0.496138916959	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.45103576332	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.496206721278	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.512100613729	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.500684129318	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.486213908081	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.449606531381	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.495952932409	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.543044895009	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.456678725678	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.499214334354	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
1.0	0.503494807855	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.469038380414	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.495171715027	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.497732461297	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.49918443594	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.545052634704	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.502538515769	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.500780663016	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.517791960506	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.500830939695	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.498625215989	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
1.0	0.502681248702	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.502960763635	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.51691373065	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.496697729672	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.461102604165	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.498770997311	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.498384437263	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.498966672282	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.531104210554	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.502796117976	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.498809425819	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.456642663254	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.495813355898	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.494753254697	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.453147490515	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
1.0	0.500112089769	Very few children.
0.0	0.511609054178	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.496669877454	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.469431366632	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.500623320377	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.497855944574	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
1.0	0.50331224092	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.497759615989	I agree with them.
0.0	0.506167913109	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.496581552111	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.493703387431	You looking at me?
0.0	0.499344852218	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.496227204257	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.

0.0	0.497447888047	I think the times are much more serious.
1.0	0.516532815775	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.499483830659	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.

0.0	0.538641924091	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.497121441636	In addition to that...
0.0	0.48655872284	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.

1.0	0.50035869618	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.495533637032	I can.
0.0	0.45357313704	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.505348486052	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.500595449406	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.

0.0	0.496742407573	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.502699839729	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.495568382244	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.501018351242	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.498430178268	I never said that.
0.0	0.499303188091	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.49876314938	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.501976527153	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.495498852924	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.457946751244	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.499768631379	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.500904021198	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.497815371109	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.498210340089	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.496273223353	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.50350767332	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.447323318006	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.498272969944	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.500767536372	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.496593106662	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.45633161146	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.494993354792	I think you're --
0.0	0.498981505848	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
1.0	0.549541827515	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.502820027679	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.500377189247	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.497417625519	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.501062934718	He was on the board.

0.0	0.498750918775	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.502043674327	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.497705583346	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.499912117495	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.495076159451	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.460982543099	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.497155346739	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.497486798857	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.501311297396	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.550939914023	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.498515902107	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.499618208624	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.496490090891	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.497348575632	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.499862295266	I know every one.
0.0	0.497329179977	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.496346803759	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.500227433133	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.500922364227	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.457042055618	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.499409202284	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.500131817052	You find me...
0.0	0.497127403557	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.493304681389	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.499837198286	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.499662245542	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.496202602458	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.495720599183	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.499109278026	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.494995187545	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.496940614894	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.502659600241	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.496077958784	No.
0.0	0.486251551859	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.494676369919	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.499206513643	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.514167260872	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.447588885208	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.501908435585	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
1.0	0.496703178016	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.500501903463	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.498900072987	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.496957146883	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.486737336307	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.498430178268	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.496701350582	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.489245635544	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.493446960088	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.503265943807	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.498601805556	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.499141619419	But I was born here.
0.0	0.500601826577	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.497063709785	In all due respect...
0.0	0.498251181015	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.475718149468	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.460988464458	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.446380670228	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.509220306295	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.497416351706	We have no borders.
0.0	0.497832292924	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.499292642236	I win.
0.0	0.498542525179	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.49812224161	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.497274828952	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.496548622727	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.5022683198	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.499471649349	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.501965517015	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.501978277052	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.496857195568	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.499563532194	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.502024851117	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.499884401559	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.504009085532	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
1.0	0.504155661887	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.49784982024	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.495047319644	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.502173093058	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.498747599378	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.50125892258	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.499819103421	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.500382811685	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.500214493966	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.497099342539	That's not right.
1.0	0.520538382984	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.497311391956	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.496995762154	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.515326258932	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.50187352802	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.499441823319	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.515071189979	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.538548176496	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.499429893259	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.501641971136	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.49947002514	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.497759615989	Think about that.
0.0	0.521834496958	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.452580414867	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.498543336133	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.496943472458	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.476770522151	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.498418349843	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.49478256824	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.499001580886	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.495851810126	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.499735396827	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.504723287565	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.504403900073	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.45327639993	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.500886676169	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.497894835635	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.494134417068	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.498132411014	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.496722450137	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.497759615989	Think about it.
0.0	0.498841492273	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.496889509617	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.498302618876	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.499447605207	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.464376965658	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.491540123343	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.499212470914	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.495339094477	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.497227493761	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.497929049411	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.498424946062	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.49881060237	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.497627565721	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.493727514975	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.512629937553	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.498937356352	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.539982818862	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.495473407973	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.522884777213	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.54064367587	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.5079188945	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.501362362462	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.

0.0	0.497755806615	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.502254827511	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
1.0	0.499783494604	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.500039632583	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.497099342539	It goes away.
0.0	0.505595899022	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.513924175721	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.49646729448	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.497838151705	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.

0.0	0.498709759648	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.

0.0	0.503478126679	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.496982266644	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.497986604984	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.498578248818	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.

0.0	0.499806823177	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.497864706111	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.496389501913	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?

0.0	0.497441071937	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.495902130995	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.497925368911	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.5019168476	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.500140738382	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.497572893382	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.497667481981	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.499251437104	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.49874480012	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.50151060968	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.498396181922	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.50125186252	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.495716273287	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.495981696957	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.

0.0	0.499873939997	They're a scam.
0.0	0.498075447104	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.500481645313	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
1.0	0.501622974341	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.498704937883	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.497753049073	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.495338340529	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.494724274691	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.501745805991	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.502251645145	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.520763964375	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.492742587622	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.456633443885	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.497633933437	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
1.0	0.56695676136	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.

0.0	0.500350072442	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.494215905494	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.499864269092	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.495683830179	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.503902232438	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.455375699371	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.499620960101	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.503938593174	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.454834136837	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.497479840066	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.496280491166	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.454175843482	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.49628977207	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.486956704146	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.497416351706	You're welcome.
0.0	0.496077958784	They know.
0.0	0.495483197097	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.50318014909	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.492731181531	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.499770382081	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.498996668878	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.502148372143	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.517793672975	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.457277202864	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.503441596798	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.451074325602	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.498229239213	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.496719668616	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.499963448914	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.501316280454	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.501923084777	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.450386084436	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.496904755373	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.498800494034	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.500340794642	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.498885243539	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.498132502978	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.495882109646	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.498526916027	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.503357680995	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.524849662331	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.505226913357	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.491796534509	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.496881019253	You know why?
0.0	0.499430861538	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.498044993107	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.496179832379	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
1.0	0.502191334138	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.498050544437	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.512493762676	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.496872009409	I will do that.
0.0	0.496767061518	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.499868779853	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.500236138657	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.498886327983	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
1.0	0.497821449046	In the past he has called him weak.
1.0	0.502810394309	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.498919732188	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.501094715689	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.49595310521	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.499824216837	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.499616553391	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.475620937766	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.497546788748	And, we said no.
0.0	0.496634741226	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.454077881767	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.498369080566	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.514442521224	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.50022445102	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.474554091742	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.49983391952	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.505026815804	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.496347212539	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.501611487698	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.499717732634	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.498636842098	We don't win.
0.0	0.49777729213	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.476722797811	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.496063181432	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.497749229681	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.492572006991	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
1.0	0.493401418139	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.502817892444	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.498482313091	Not bad.
1.0	0.500236960218	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.495325447647	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.518629605388	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.496569266933	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.497943459722	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.452846204708	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.497427872668	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.500731998572	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.523142198491	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.495076442662	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.498010136612	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.49626867353	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.497810805702	We haven't.
0.0	0.501318311508	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.498513040553	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.500005477509	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.49975635234	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.499127764434	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.495537891467	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.494666108514	...
0.0	0.452829725081	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.498486012363	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.502242827908	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.447244934808	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.502091884631	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.504329483725	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.497625000391	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.516830666989	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.49071944746	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.493330667086	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.500978928662	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.492510463097	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.498809650311	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
1.0	0.502660804429	It looked like very few women.
1.0	0.506166847702	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.49580338674	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.542839120954	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.499334195872	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.475291855902	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.507605384314	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.45006586897	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.496040295722	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.49562261932	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.501700016407	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.502229663107	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.498457224345	That will change everything.
0.0	0.498350701315	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.459109644014	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.496652455566	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.457070829789	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.496674256873	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.460194663379	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.513819337873	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.497077075738	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.50317182075	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.503319880062	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.500269674314	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.500498219906	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.49733067929	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.505938600292	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.496704894699	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.499541310349	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.497270972178	Nobody can deny them.
1.0	0.502066867136	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.493608975912	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.498875202206	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.50779690439	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.499964295887	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.501079786689	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.499168407024	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.49925856871	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.4995811129	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.495390775208	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.54494420635	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.498204665086	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.497331999251	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.498464321496	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.492561366548	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.498902743537	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.496776566225	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.499105624156	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.499344852218	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.50095727899	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.45766062892	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.500045151937	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.5006310918	(inaudible).
0.0	0.497946562094	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.499860154429	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.477495976176	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.494663694834	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.492827583726	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.498994983026	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.499287369353	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.500995261963	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.494405270711	OK?
0.0	0.497801266585	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.451524077431	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.542521144778	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.497947309627	Well, thank you very much.
1.0	0.505085431354	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.519688621998	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.497909694373	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.497102945535	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.50876655319	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.49470226677	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.498291672001	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.4982966518	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.498636842098	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.501644357332	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.498033634523	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.500864639755	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.497099342539	It never happens.
0.0	0.500202501194	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.500270646914	That never works.
0.0	0.503670255971	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.509855184781	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.4973940521	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.499012990042	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.499883370882	My name was mentioned here.
1.0	0.508590715283	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.518346949665	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.500248279477	I'm tested.
0.0	0.500342666861	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.500889004945	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.488187496434	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.502945204999	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.494567971478	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.495918811841	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.501517780309	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.501035799669	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.501668885992	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.501448392214	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.497127403557	They're off to China.
0.0	0.496773362871	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.498185139187	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.455696402251	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.459114487201	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.504513799215	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.496409862533	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.49980754474	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.496221132118	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.490252627971	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.45493211245	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.500401148968	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.448145284935	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.495554943923	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.503780688148	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.536728359258	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.496290093939	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.497099342539	It never happens.
0.0	0.49887499387	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.499645088735	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.495237302815	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.47704604234	I was the architect.
0.0	0.495235900009	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.541903402338	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.497094536454	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.498726946583	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.500139385216	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.49841889747	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.496939670201	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.502461264186	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.497881904865	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.499374236371	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.497958341702	That is our government today.
0.0	0.496582279549	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.493224601907	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.502538448279	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.494405270711	OK?
0.0	0.50326442548	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.497895677749	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.496997989225	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.493954719045	That is...
0.0	0.501368824002	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.499818328071	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.499187768503	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.517759704057	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
1.0	0.461532670558	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.515816106299	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.497987740046	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.498914563632	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.497932179177	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.496881019253	You know why?
0.0	0.497957528552	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.497810805702	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.49916296321	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.505258165445	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.499539092497	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.497866450676	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.493794071224	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.498190117628	to save a company.
0.0	0.498246992648	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.513097750477	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.491979399407	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.499949218264	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.455729986876	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.498669077657	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.497059416204	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.49213198482	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.497416351706	Check it out.
0.0	0.501744872113	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.500292570301	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.496591688002	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.513134747691	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.501629799482	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.55006436616	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.500597193316	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.497102852549	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.496501619324	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.498675108199	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.499811333677	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.492428506246	...Chris...
0.0	0.544218665434	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.499483590286	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.49552370528	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.499470266357	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.498364357759	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.495114394912	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.498118420665	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.457920021997	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.502848292829	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.495134057975	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.499241943356	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
1.0	0.505642284924	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.500617246787	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.535218021253	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
1.0	0.516556952296	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.497367609527	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.498233988166	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.497707223786	No, no.
0.0	0.468754193297	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.501439981516	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.49588534487	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.498654539175	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.499394774429	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
1.0	0.497029320944	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.497426841051	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.497425897359	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.494972820497	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.50293034874	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."

0.0	0.497786768098	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.522097679018	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?

0.0	0.497465990926	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.

0.0	0.500448547469	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.50169849069	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.502740317625	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.496927426343	And you know what?
0.0	0.525876191781	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
1.0	0.508840618673	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.493470509775	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.497386980517	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.501965391052	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.500254126789	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.496897154539	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.499097407464	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.467641433227	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
1.0	0.499172422627	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.499079609392	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.497839974569	They have to come into this country legally.
1.0	0.501244074995	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.451477077412	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.499158828142	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
1.0	0.507308708336	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.499287381858	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.501845221398	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.49993357203	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.5124012402	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.507270534421	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.494857739788	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.500658859083	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.498818688879	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.49683334786	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.494485446857	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.500135920336	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.451842798512	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.498669447816	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.500766163729	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.49751252962	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.503534348075	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.47600835062	The answer is no.
0.0	0.504051198205	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.502362258099	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.498430178268	What have you got now?
0.0	0.498148446596	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.497416351706	You know that.
0.0	0.497790682593	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.500803447086	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.498139880071	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.500068955524	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.498056584411	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.500718669938	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.4962153665	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.502752499184	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.498521446085	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.540925086998	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.456473302479	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.499371652519	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.452919172308	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.45004528747	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.49926836072	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.498593117711	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.499299154011	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.501431795292	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.494813153408	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.498370396846	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.490979501061	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.502040278878	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.495338340529	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.493454641593	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.51889897411	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.49678525143	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.479649332001	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.500321713152	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.50455575121	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.49938877083	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.495969126066	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.453310930669	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.510947094779	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.502075316433	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.499568681586	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.462776624644	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.500273075334	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.500587665383	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.498285268262	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.494864760607	I have no illusion.
1.0	0.499620961028	They were wrong.
0.0	0.497426509812	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.501725779091	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.500926717844	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.501565763424	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.512943857745	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.539529110991	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.494652171107	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.453628166859	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.498413197903	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.501379563614	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.497577825199	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.496361892627	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.449148404295	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.498531356621	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.477355201351	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.501076030295	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.500489934964	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.512677201861	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.498720872994	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.508156612213	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.500276844286	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
1.0	0.500179233349	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.447003105245	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.488668097158	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.500973924273	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.481734850377	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.497920823415	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.500164924814	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.500209620125	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.50078491924	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.50007717076	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.477355043285	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.452018351718	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.499446149819	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.498944276416	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.500591602207	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.49514411638	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.500266279947	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.50031082224	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.501299450322	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.497332021891	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.497304150098	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.501207044706	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.499838100833	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.514129367826	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.498208429167	That's my bill.
0.0	0.496472399874	Say again?
0.0	0.497175754247	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.457826658073	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.500362154208	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.501354542431	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.500799570114	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.501099942631	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.50077013373	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.500474622	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.494864760607	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.48479230606	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.491628451377	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.498021357322	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.50366463444	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.498648170787	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.500254921985	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.496901216128	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.

0.0	0.49780034728	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.494793070864	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...

0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.495497287862	Now, we're going to blame the people.
1.0	0.519469270754	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.500008463397	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.491487500595	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.545333506105	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.496077958784	Creativity.
0.0	0.500542781448	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.497613778585	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.500153365793	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.500598505912	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.

0.0	0.498448842403	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.492250725561	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.496526912382	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.498521901068	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.452177357591	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.497043820827	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.497257408466	How great is that?
0.0	0.496080543301	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.498334198146	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.453368377132	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.475257442112	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.494926940064	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.503659364948	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.49655389699	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.498662375825	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.505166178	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.502884587977	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.496872009409	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.453423997116	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.497853632855	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.517759565997	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.502591648541	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.493934068711	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.496943316174	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.494708974942	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.497127403557	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.517755937289	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.49932034477	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.503460211963	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.498519926359	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.494219562765	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.501571023142	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.491776775616	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.497873868344	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.488017922829	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.497407023298	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.492896664133	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.498019590247	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.497252235266	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.496616797521	We can't do this unilaterally.
1.0	0.505789476574	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.498731321476	And for good cause.
0.0	0.496630231105	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.49932240757	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.502009760388	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.512756469465	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.501547357265	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.497286364935	It's their money.
0.0	0.546589524785	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.500587665383	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.511522088363	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.496236194309	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.498784325179	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.499879405337	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.501915011228	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.492217750907	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.495076745434	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.500031069386	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.459579888097	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.501015653248	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.496858445035	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.498226167805	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.498791205186	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.498604277979	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.501645352657	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.495664430998	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.496292323826	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.460752986805	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.496481416329	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.517192188312	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.498968055089	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.502696852685	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.548703946408	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.499822482742	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.499396042855	I totally get that.
0.0	0.500118219841	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.498925817053	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.503294239124	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.495860894068	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.502827796232	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.458118011924	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.455330260563	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.543990697489	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.497833829512	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.503121221968	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.49689150479	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.503232468608	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.501048594179	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.49616950813	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.495100646275	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.499012425768	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.4996914871	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.491376515519	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.4990444015	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.503101588952	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.497373833238	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.50257059796	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.502284322882	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.504699849242	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.503101813181	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.

0.0	0.511706410725	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.

0.0	0.455507048984	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.500488527632	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.496262254639	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.500872852877	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.403363558847	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.456255984735	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.4985859016	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.495127196482	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
1.0	0.521571729508	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.49858388156	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.497840464722	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.453891938598	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.496699792918	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.49122001262	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.498216524854	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
1.0	0.499281441514	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.499361231074	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.496108182767	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.492291499921	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.495929515584	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.501543784324	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.494017356662	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.498164401658	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.524947342315	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.458140979978	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.495789792729	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.496239484532	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.499017055434	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.498441491227	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.495584778943	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.501069125451	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.493769938801	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.49785965637	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.497811918746	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.502147947421	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.497699299389	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.473737034642	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.502836739251	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.448230128951	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.501930226635	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.494290212427	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.498040647592	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.498780750465	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.499048017621	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.499888310014	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.49200501108	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.498290104509	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.500926259773	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.497514881779	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.496464607442	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.494533490867	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.496712427814	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.504763665608	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.502544846861	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.501052245429	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.498475368075	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.49679027383	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.491853129236	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.459506538933	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.544313204831	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.499657462971	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.498072064084	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.500355081311	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.500065231783	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.502613388255	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.501728570726	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.454159339905	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.504058649584	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.498118497724	And God bless America.
0.0	0.497778178429	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.500214960523	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.453793438228	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.495637451359	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.502771511078	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.497726912176	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.499859638146	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.501099254046	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.53040135412	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.500208272223	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.498127286173	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.451716128922	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.499793787373	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.565602455576	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.4968594118	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.499006146362	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.497303815961	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.498486503428	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
1.0	0.49826829757	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.501033396906	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.497893349398	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.500586443684	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.498704464473	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.49640310577	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.500500719537	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.528416321876	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.495100203231	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.50227503435	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.50143191082	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.497307724217	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.449976975888	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.501317729522	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.500232211152	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.494123029387	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.495060529864	Again...
0.0	0.499351552663	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
1.0	0.497686093249	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.502740930335	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.496676733179	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.501298625672	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.499746419164	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.497688981261	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.497211876638	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.530671058238	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.501698169336	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.499409363192	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.494757850882	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.499844372861	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.493063275172	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.501272853843	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.495232451154	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.502039436013	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.500194257595	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.499789622074	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
1.0	0.502133751673	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.49740535946	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.497877551173	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.494177228367	But look...
0.0	0.497976006032	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.499289093799	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.468484890266	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.488527116391	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.496515644622	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.499182882266	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.450646374359	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.499154828884	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.496472399874	Absolutely.
0.0	0.498449056266	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.500065893342	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.499475110199	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.496077958784	We do.
0.0	0.50065675435	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.500142343004	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.496472399874	Right.
0.0	0.496592970148	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.501793645161	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.498666072758	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.500093044632	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.498187201819	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.493436493319	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.471779468309	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.502753508751	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.499453337502	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.501468921827	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.499637240138	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.497624015364	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.504243320832	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.500705606718	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.501485148547	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.501298656028	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.496077958784	Thank you.
0.0	0.501046240501	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.494607954707	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.496775490632	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.509831527354	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.500338572692	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.498381819453	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.497178761779	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.501359913812	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.497325558707	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.499273871795	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.497054385671	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.501850541191	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.50036205425	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.49988099544	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.501178577153	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.501321993781	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.505253216277	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.511071011696	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.500637738405	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.496077958784	No.
0.0	0.499402511252	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.501528664305	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.49684758956	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.501849211027	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.49558380484	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.501912094371	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.504591364222	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.505088638333	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.497224895042	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.499420170541	I don't care.
0.0	0.515757024591	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.496777156988	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.49978518659	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.

0.0	0.546439606998	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.503395996839	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.525474799776	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.501447207613	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.498154117458	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.496872009409	What should we do?
0.0	0.499233014871	He has never defended...

0.0	0.496064159947	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.518967978933	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.540818569561	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.496183681122	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.454900619546	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.

0.0	0.498752772492	And we have to take on ISIS online.

0.0	0.49463024537	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.500355078832	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.

0.0	0.502000842421	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.474981403414	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.450142773265	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.498056805771	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.494763451371	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
1.0	0.499112155891	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.497810805702	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.503772654058	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.497345103228	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.500971020018	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.498158400031	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.492507268864	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.495955427548	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.496964548558	I want to take care of women.

0.0	0.502136186658	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.496927426343	But you know what?
0.0	0.498991127056	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.50260554959	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.448792716929	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.497610996628	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.500686731933	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.499819103421	Of course not.
0.0	0.453709524688	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.505930485188	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.496261338296	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.497227910574	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.502577368948	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.500668790793	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.504845607913	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.450550738826	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.498887398121	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.459677065416	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.497913494672	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.497006821133	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.494969929232	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.499310113906	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.496704894699	It's true.
0.0	0.501107336313	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.448495699561	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.498106193249	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.519378348672	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.501005199291	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.499161283001	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.501049901185	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.453010746017	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.537563744672	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.497845882033	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.511394336695	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.513243251315	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.494348020741	Maria...
0.0	0.498265621288	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.497465812869	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.494093755062	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.504723422155	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.480578620701	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.499595646503	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.509811967966	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.499821786762	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.457371490432	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.546581320094	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.500118252658	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.500945178315	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.499875528157	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.494059717734	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.501302820339	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.456972895994	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.501591846634	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.49143174386	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.508954005522	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.497806102382	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.501158230286	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.505972387078	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.497801012898	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.497549372353	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.498532730618	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.499426945971	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.497619211151	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.499179426777	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.498888009006	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.492821167554	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.502630137213	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.494666108514	...
0.0	0.49710106507	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.56695676136	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.497759615989	Wait for what?
0.0	0.499736796566	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.496472399874	Absolutely.
0.0	0.499276399195	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.505444864841	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.412326195396	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.498544272702	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.49736550927	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.497495007782	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.499261043982	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.514072749289	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.501037546736	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.503137670886	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.486215243818	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.497821531636	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.503234051951	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.500962876881	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.501847026206	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.498861342618	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.494737575756	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.497759615989	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.473337286572	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.498021301463	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.501045066255	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.496077958784	I do.
0.0	0.491838081699	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.498899382671	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.501231658949	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.496540677548	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.503457073899	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.498102408694	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.485026252706	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.495835336418	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.496780082054	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.497291067281	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.498438406282	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.495962800877	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.457881374466	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.501009798728	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.497990421293	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.455691216417	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.48208520387	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.498041543464	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.499717485728	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.497318346961	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.488634880341	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.500536613886	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.451948723133	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.502966964214	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
1.0	0.503911651993	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.496473136065	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.499168495328	You really can't.
0.0	0.496571452519	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.499649033329	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.49188270171	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.497615680859	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.501214875266	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.503995455557	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.496830829869	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.500254126789	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
