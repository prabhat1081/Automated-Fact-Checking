0.0	0.499261983955	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.501491720151	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.417344740017	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.49868577142	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.496777570446	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.492369021153	But...
0.0	0.493782614745	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.506248385329	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.419050162627	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.468958764151	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.503180425978	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.504605131986	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.497887124593	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.497231669148	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.498679662674	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.411422179966	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.40931822333	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.493346703404	I have...
0.0	0.493115738003	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.4986400176	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.497861423982	I promise.
0.0	0.49997706944	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.497318138757	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.505363971471	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.49836369675	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.587929989445	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.5035105296	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
1.0	0.496209270555	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.498872265678	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.497861423982	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.494413352753	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.495839168818	I understand.
0.0	0.495771769342	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.494822851048	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.494041779114	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.495794907778	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.499002075605	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.501633439709	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.504596043528	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.491558054121	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.493507139517	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.506123146517	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.489418770929	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.494135505624	So...
0.0	0.502143964651	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
1.0	0.5106856648	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.492920952624	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.506447563001	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.499360052262	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.492480182034	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.493602538168	I'll say this.
0.0	0.493748656279	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.497857802463	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.493727341199	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.508034132608	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.413191226584	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.495433054267	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.497988470993	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.499920498555	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.421295794072	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.493898664522	It is.
0.0	0.500631697348	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.499458218596	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.500704817259	He hit oil.
0.0	0.497909742152	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.497367771328	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.500892917671	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.521558094377	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.495243323684	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.500623349297	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.490188716437	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.497892403032	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.497002182469	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.499192401301	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.500411899325	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.391410186239	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.506545214393	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.494905328903	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.492874201961	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.494691108761	OK?
0.0	0.410215462902	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.490716208327	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.489508145868	No -- no...
0.0	0.49526773263	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.500697651242	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.504253119293	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.498547959591	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.593003138304	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.504405967897	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.499822904571	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.496392511345	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.498948737256	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.495188821669	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.491544707331	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.4948284302	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.490611608517	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.506056750054	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.494760368164	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.503707048531	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.502004871697	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.405812900614	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.500454075436	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.489422936234	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.499366396131	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.502055086396	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.503061233678	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.498652566338	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.501583056235	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.585914489485	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.497119134518	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.497590958027	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.496772735539	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.499232597119	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.505348116277	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.497403016279	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.496410870996	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.40673748996	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.50901366064	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.499124993985	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.410003926827	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.571830692745	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.491122574142	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.495377585508	Think about it.
0.0	0.411352173037	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.525429210267	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.509694471611	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.503414779121	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.498484778293	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.503154099332	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
1.0	0.449041875434	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.494691108761	Yeah.
0.0	0.495794907778	But I would add this.
1.0	0.509274685694	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
1.0	0.59354718603	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.499161640643	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.488108792093	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.498633846755	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.599329749069	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.4981214652	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.497939325414	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
1.0	0.50409143567	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.495494614072	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.505985680289	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.411647566479	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
1.0	0.669990319474	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.505704586214	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.498118678937	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.498940541894	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.413326079448	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.495377585508	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.507335614728	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.406822988105	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.493948164603	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.492810462948	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.501862436384	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.492236705984	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.500079205164	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.509396313259	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.505212964304	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.507084663887	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.411771396081	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.491717147849	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.505181617384	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.321657449576	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.489399887936	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.499032763511	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.502301630235	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.499964595182	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.587425810078	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.50152306168	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.407921598213	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.497690077813	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.495872291651	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.507342901068	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.499395927317	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.505647433511	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.492041260163	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.492920952624	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.493346703404	...
0.0	0.497616158406	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.494135505624	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.496800359899	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.492811444227	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.501747970615	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.495479958386	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.493910642344	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.497857802463	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.486433152666	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.491553215164	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.506524119179	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.499139815186	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.497624752667	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.494135505624	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.497229509158	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.514452702221	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.492671949162	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.493700949571	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.496364409492	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.498202009166	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.496002543135	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.498826493871	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.492719833955	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.526964329692	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.49385745369	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.500852653782	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.497314569164	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.502035715914	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.521838499678	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.505063768835	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.493598917177	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.506281800512	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.47163493401	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.5249677439	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.489224240153	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.40360378312	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.497697138902	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.488709150508	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.501947552085	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.499146864802	Maria, let me clear something up here.
1.0	0.591040186489	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.498673510456	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.493542036737	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.492369021153	And...
0.0	0.49963528034	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.497857802463	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.500174671922	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.412354134618	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
1.0	0.506384873986	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.500859959274	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.50688283381	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.501104207416	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.498806870653	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.495156239721	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.491109141233	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.505512023899	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.496413388275	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.510340089315	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.49436970346	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.469898577473	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.413583439857	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.501456043507	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.586493989615	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.499755906844	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.498533141599	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.497857802463	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.59008141963	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.47568900492	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.517822549071	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.495191488916	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.497217462913	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.499786718316	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.496911281013	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.50416864762	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.498731318621	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.499052676244	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.499681845259	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.40629883977	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
1.0	0.497769846694	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.498172191868	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.499100174705	Both served.
0.0	0.505852952084	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.497583383958	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.496571177503	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.499913767503	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.409697207287	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.414888476951	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.496919355036	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.510711354108	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.500231580156	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.420220919445	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.500813850691	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.497068896928	He does great.
0.0	0.498424538366	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.49845123654	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.527036809252	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.498500730601	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.49996008877	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.504629958337	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.494426635629	I love China.
0.0	0.494015709931	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.499453208794	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.501775464959	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.493523172201	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.496481411283	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.494869484337	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.498365840759	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.4998364818	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.499914015443	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.496777570446	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.493343082461	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.492369369346	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.500165604233	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.493346703404	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.494691108761	Illegal.
0.0	0.497857802463	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.508587394126	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.500273208785	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.493769171437	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.403003081795	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.492917029946	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.497690077813	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.501921034535	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.507651555217	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.498547959591	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.497068896928	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.494990169555	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.496365187631	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.506138067202	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.500729363762	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.500751027534	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.497005193034	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.416800253381	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.497372246445	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.502178250968	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
1.0	0.503384097051	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.496323619037	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.491208241449	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.403666444627	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.496640685042	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.49625756393	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.473513902408	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.525768298107	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.492924263948	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.497861423982	They cause dishonesty.
1.0	0.505746342021	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.49946861968	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.499172889235	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.499462433555	Here's a fact.
1.0	0.505800798043	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.49534555066	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.494857750405	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.495479958386	How about this?
0.0	0.408393146579	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.496362426505	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.49681845965	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.467969310655	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.497656390637	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.494691108761	So you know what?
0.0	0.494691108761	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.409412915243	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.498976101929	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.489591953421	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.499466055136	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.499918422399	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.500583246361	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.5003101818	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.497514971035	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.498673510456	That's the difference.
0.0	0.498650340223	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.493730962214	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.517046146505	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.487652611199	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.497788524147	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.396114683912	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.498122300471	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.502209596576	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.500604966672	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.496932153482	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.491642685944	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.495068859704	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.582695746979	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.495565458051	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.497290765722	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.50329218516	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.494598739748	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.50893083543	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.498248168462	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.490943809073	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.498392032741	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.491949184215	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.496054808004	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.493046964699	I would just say that...
0.0	0.499030325234	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.49985280529	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.499462433555	That's not true.
0.0	0.414347237105	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.496843821976	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.482782679247	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.501727059237	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.499152753381	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.498547959591	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.492174622511	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.493791587745	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.504239323368	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.494381542154	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.50843538502	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.505566016657	We put in place child care support.

0.0	0.495479958386	Ever.
0.0	0.494040269842	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.502653443834	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.493713358465	And you know what?
0.0	0.496525673257	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.51010302862	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.508336964309	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
1.0	0.501009980007	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.495728129423	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.497595613215	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.495940864779	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.483716773777	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.502538354557	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.49978641044	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.498411839599	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.49696407628	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.510408056575	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.494208894968	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.494391350288	I will not do that.
0.0	0.496401100719	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
1.0	0.508500855895	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.490298369452	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.502850596491	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.471646614928	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.404679311239	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.470363970469	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.499573265409	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.495369939196	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.49657345247	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.50024699016	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1.0	0.500442528272	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.495929761949	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.499736861226	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.49728504216	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.494691108761	John.
0.0	0.484946611124	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.507367278799	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.495098689913	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.490141382387	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.495467363448	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.493676459641	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.498082161394	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
1.0	0.500569927817	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.496845046064	His family certainly believes that.
1.0	0.49605615998	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.496718645152	She was right.
0.0	0.493713358465	And why?
0.0	0.50327884176	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.490842041363	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.497792347424	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.494687487585	That's not right.
0.0	0.498376611652	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.590613093068	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.497518227252	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.502942174739	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.50591839354	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.496089965777	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.505182093059	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.507833357467	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.501716180477	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.494691108761	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.494691108761	No.
0.0	0.494838986288	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.499989805233	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.501157071447	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.493898664522	That's right.
0.0	0.49988909974	The economy was really booming.
1.0	0.584448253252	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.501687841857	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.496653749809	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.500809845598	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.493730962214	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.497857802463	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.49881906477	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.493343082461	That has not been...
0.0	0.504159223332	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.489623027354	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.50171241142	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.502254274061	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.491241002008	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.411966108341	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.49688395648	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.47423536929	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.494687487585	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.492850741746	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.497857802463	The problem is we never get it done.
1.0	0.504300595021	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.407032802209	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.587686452507	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.499191395107	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.504076090868	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.506415716972	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.493676459641	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.504514643358	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.505465899873	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.499131154217	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.501047602051	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.589539109286	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.493901453793	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.475423044659	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.409089687093	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.499786718316	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.495479958386	You're right.
0.0	0.510050453146	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.498747273811	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.498779754528	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
1.0	0.507449527382	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.49664440115	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.496525673257	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.491861451992	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.498388327665	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.496892610768	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.498547959591	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.496643133763	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.500633113781	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.409988631272	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.497634429394	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.499847687894	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.526964329692	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.505562570094	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.493809404103	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.49667897382	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.502298392963	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.504437460508	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.496046649688	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.497131804316	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.497358463355	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.503660719457	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.497061181414	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.498132633185	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.501202403891	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.497926931741	Our next president...
0.0	0.495104300844	I've laid out...
0.0	0.498676041115	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.493730962214	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.500705688555	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.496808716016	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.499788163691	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.490438642251	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.505752445577	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.502509032644	Just for the record.
0.0	0.500392731753	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.498948737256	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.497315090428	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.503731475181	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.498219408464	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.493493701738	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.497068896928	He's wrong.
0.0	0.492158607789	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.495479958386	Right.
0.0	0.496670978461	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.49994969802	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.495100043212	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.49533794346	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.38709678893	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.495817347832	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.4694952165	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.493602538168	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.501376362133	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.494375256602	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.495643910818	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.501477271945	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.492586689122	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.503124842169	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.498673510456	That's fine.
0.0	0.501541713572	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.492125561449	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.500450453854	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.493346703404	...before I go.
0.0	0.504864857021	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.494777900462	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.499701848854	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.496609849805	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.497203386101	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.49758769866	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.494736718871	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.493320754662	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.501788878987	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.498253072647	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.50089875887	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.495759884819	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.49844445974	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.498676041115	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.492230518908	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.490862307462	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.501475368065	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.484601025911	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.501265524778	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.506641409947	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.502170936829	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.502743754679	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.493898664522	That's what he is.
0.0	0.49397031696	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.492807080148	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.495308982812	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.522273383207	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
1.0	0.504806294865	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.498480652008	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.49349655279	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.405450927676	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.47998551484	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.480889438936	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.599711683154	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.417068326923	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.507115886574	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.496657371232	We need sound money.
0.0	0.500605134803	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.401356412276	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.493970679873	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.501821034212	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.50124061778	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.497010466967	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.590288074858	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.492483061039	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.493602538168	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.505600682356	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.491501948385	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.501114655727	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.495835547485	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.501033581659	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.500284303567	A brief response.
0.0	0.499255185588	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.492644236873	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.495929761949	You did.
0.0	0.4978986996	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.495039284581	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.502218151701	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.499336881903	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.485434023258	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.503435921935	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.525952650548	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
1.0	0.498948737256	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.496883569207	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.49988909974	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.493360516485	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.511137128485	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
1.0	0.499421371659	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.498251679452	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.49668874921	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.497068896928	It feels different.
0.0	0.504230764319	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.500575644053	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.496718645152	I never said that.
0.0	0.495068859704	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.493898664522	Why is that?
0.0	0.497535190312	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.498679662674	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.493546971148	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.499786718316	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.50227233028	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.512529296986	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.500367398426	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.498289717158	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.49982341724	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.494691108761	OK?
0.0	0.495921619548	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.502101602041	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.49711205403	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.500280681983	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.587017862002	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.500870448491	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.500152599497	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.495929761949	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.502856961023	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.499144620382	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.524151469605	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.49466663223	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.492700069422	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.506425861102	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.507992227439	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.495479958386	Well, sure.
0.0	0.495479958386	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.496139644101	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.503532474404	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.520337053561	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.491896122297	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.495380428203	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.501555513283	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.49211355261	You just want to...
0.0	0.495479958386	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.497965242111	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.495839168818	I love this country.
0.0	0.499999631417	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.495172732897	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.524893400706	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.4970104372	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.501834852158	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.501792382755	Two points.
0.0	0.496091060901	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.40743601679	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.49632344862	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.499100174705	I changed that.
0.0	0.493814507277	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.499741283319	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.51085504666	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.531236698144	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.501417570783	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.495572902221	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.497541989943	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.500700378774	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.499280760471	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.500238265954	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.494529334862	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.504408767594	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.497068896928	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.492731941133	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.499771272129	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.509699708412	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
1.0	0.497083636224	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.494963634635	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
1.0	0.489122681649	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.50089111637	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.498704489851	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.494691108761	No.
0.0	0.500717397249	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.495399598834	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.500467385493	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.498353424963	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.502942174739	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.496764519855	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.507941442128	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.498188386554	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.496336726799	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.50187402376	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.500698784562	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.487583100159	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.509721379763	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.494691108761	Check it out.
0.0	0.496535839074	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.499100174705	They were wrong.
0.0	0.500292441769	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.501193004863	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.490979550882	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.589329079564	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
1.0	0.504237976538	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.491582572088	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.495450063604	No vision at all.
0.0	0.492776396832	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.500254980915	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.503891061096	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.498679662674	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.500975483797	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.507144072408	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.494237725334	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.493693595196	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.496405826984	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.494288981971	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.499036947225	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.595430811843	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.508812075276	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.500580660683	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.499882127949	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.49145851673	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.492666984917	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.498830776108	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.495879995109	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.486231263757	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.497689549816	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.501936543837	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.504484737776	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.502538354557	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.503011971597	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.500009427561	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.494246449946	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.498248168462	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
1.0	0.505533111493	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.519671050318	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.526177631833	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.496718645152	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.499367985588	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.507418345833	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.502834944562	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.498547959591	On welfare.
0.0	0.497861423982	I have no idea.
0.0	0.493146004144	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.499366204514	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.494288981971	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.492669096445	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.488040651879	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.504710428739	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.505614177115	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.468891026915	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.508027777386	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.496342805156	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.50611996783	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.601010681415	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.50396318285	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.492741565211	I want security.
0.0	0.500329446714	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.482146526259	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.414060411608	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.498476436468	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.496984977288	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.503226858771	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.498277490768	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.497857802463	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.

0.0	0.510916611564	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.497887124593	This is a bad deal.

0.0	0.49605615998	My point is this.
0.0	0.497637250743	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.491027908761	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.492665475639	I think he is right.

1.0	0.596054133541	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.499256705724	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.409019922608	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.527033873599	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.494015274779	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.

0.0	0.497595485687	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.50522108059	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.594742230081	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.500661432478	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.501645728289	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.

0.0	0.499567378211	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.495345963086	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.510265868273	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.500941524393	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.498679662674	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.492816673771	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.501374191864	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.497892403032	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.50667416508	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.496718645152	I didn't.
0.0	0.498848919416	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.590193105278	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.520896898492	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.498094358701	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.492021865076	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.493624469021	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.49977582489	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.499672910364	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.49088415398	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.494374832938	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
1.0	0.500008339368	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.494691108761	We have to do something.
0.0	0.498948737256	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.412650590227	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.526866466939	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.502120895176	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.498766662571	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.494318424349	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.501546394098	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.495377585508	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.500478771323	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.493898664522	He undermines it.
0.0	0.502965078208	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.496803713869	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.502747318712	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.492874558284	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.505452502432	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.498476436468	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.398014652537	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.494718463717	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.49738267063	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.500991238583	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.502319977314	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.50418756643	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.507725732928	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.4087653406	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.500525649951	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.524938494272	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.498432984656	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.500084925705	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.494592591302	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.510867320834	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.493498597929	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.498948737256	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.489530556745	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.512302225614	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.498606223157	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.507673809407	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.50247729022	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.

0.0	0.498293177376	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.505024134	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.515266843135	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.493709984766	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.488230691632	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.500254980915	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.498967338654	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.50280864565	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.496677325127	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.502111372399	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.500276775238	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.

0.0	0.469551737628	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.46798011957	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.591894095854	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.413527736917	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.494583439203	...income tax...
0.0	0.497459257158	We will win on everything we do.

0.0	0.392027719463	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.497861423982	You bet they do.
0.0	0.497793129894	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
1.0	0.509465360484	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.509162315955	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.496772735539	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.495460338276	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.497017280126	Eleven points, to be exact.

0.0	0.500284303567	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.496992857965	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.497077868831	She said the truth.
0.0	0.493602538168	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.507437223551	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.586097829769	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.495839168818	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.495927800443	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.

0.0	0.496901175052	We're running.

1.0	0.506480449879	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.593762789511	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.

0.0	0.506647180924	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.495182418627	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.501742192804	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.488559637618	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.

0.0	0.493898664522	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.494542660855	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.445610776	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.491580646735	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.494502174745	And here's why.
0.0	0.477876585164	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.500128082048	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.43678752148	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.491438036766	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.526143960487	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
1.0	0.505687756166	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.498281684697	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.492550627446	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.49922938165	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.409721103004	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.49637484899	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.498398003859	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.500187746431	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.491921063243	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.494691108761	Alright.
0.0	0.497278524925	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.493270277425	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.409090210583	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.503645606538	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.495837342573	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.496199884223	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.494426003468	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.497444582268	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.505152012019	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
1.0	0.498948737256	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.503367631414	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.413546187937	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.50247891469	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.494691108761	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.501239921726	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.497241927806	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.49353797625	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.498900626042	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.501134368483	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.498134923381	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.501621203265	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.50486924558	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.49695553846	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.508210894548	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.502980974282	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.494624004052	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.495247397469	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.517687577424	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.492390657297	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.498650340223	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.492929923038	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.472008083541	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.508955551204	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.501912284556	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.500542929714	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.499786718316	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.493641573627	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.494391350288	We can't do it.
0.0	0.4978819944	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.499675322447	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.498995401513	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.496124190894	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.499503265989	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.497427630298	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.497135318869	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.58924401829	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.502231820971	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.496628049893	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.49524479682	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.423728375615	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.504351372202	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.500931058731	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.496570835367	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.506333879417	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.512679212436	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.492755310894	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.492086021564	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.496772735539	I would change them.
0.0	0.506859491077	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.492576553313	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.496487670055	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.49837987106	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.491355398656	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.496458651654	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.499801031879	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.497597547914	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.500499796529	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
1.0	0.505888796183	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.499212079407	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.502363332744	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.498790859568	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.498723310214	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
1.0	0.49912976007	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.496195436544	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.512472122831	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.494691108761	Yeah.
0.0	0.492687714463	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.493975894762	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.502833652663	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.500582157809	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.499290674036	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.592907681314	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.494010221304	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.500343905203	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.498547959591	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.499831964221	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.574018233466	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.499725980105	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.497405165907	I was not at all.
1.0	0.493727341199	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.504116024912	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.501505014882	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.496596535242	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.499466055136	I'm ready.
0.0	0.522367113724	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.493346703404	...Thank you.
0.0	0.5047301259	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.496477755444	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.409164780996	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.496701454687	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.498234876229	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.484780917702	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.495806746438	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.496718645152	I never said that.
0.0	0.490506747692	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.480672312692	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.503136636698	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.495215476829	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.492813881411	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.499491756183	He is a good man.
0.0	0.587609946584	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.511573537063	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.521691631776	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.5028541379	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.481551707772	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.48943204797	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
1.0	0.505762001774	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.501345924037	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.493346703404	...
0.0	0.500460286935	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.501210057958	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.494939604964	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.528237429675	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.

0.0	0.49917766884	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.50133909205	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.501205755132	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.498141785573	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.

0.0	0.499631362166	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.487779748886	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.

0.0	0.501851823328	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.495392166116	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.498657401411	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.494173013326	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.505992254341	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.504621878913	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.493637139187	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.507590624688	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.500895007361	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.

0.0	0.500152599497	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.489348583805	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.487641707546	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.485881812934	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
1.0	0.497690055482	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.50586588115	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.498940024949	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.496460021996	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.503998006737	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.406907171816	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.494789283165	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.497920228384	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.521462754212	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.

0.0	0.501364444694	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.474880660199	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.498111613342	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.499260627125	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.49430314481	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.496410717373	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
1.0	0.508154197559	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.408128528005	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.496708165687	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.502963773166	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
1.0	0.499959645306	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.587709467326	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.496445181266	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.584729348598	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.496901175052	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.58298476462	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.494519779147	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.49336535456	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.

0.0	0.501333809239	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.526942475313	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.497688132037	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.49621983175	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.496816465448	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.499202128928	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.497592614937	We cannot be the world's policeman.
1.0	0.504556501997	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.494943937729	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.498130270045	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.591412235996	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.

0.0	0.501946312554	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.492975903934	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.500856560192	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.501396550407	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.498210995137	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.490662524944	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.497950321536	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.491298036431	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.489865260113	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.485183079686	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.499466055136	OK, good.
0.0	0.497561636056	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.495767148229	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.492553245633	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.50511623123	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.482674170269	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.505124369712	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.413160288046	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.475390332841	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.496957340486	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.496429043953	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.502982720701	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.504619536538	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.487817713444	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.501033581659	You have to lead.
0.0	0.495479958386	Right.
0.0	0.496704339334	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.497395058887	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.501102841987	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.500284303567	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.497683655088	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.505276958976	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.498478757264	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.502942174739	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.486885339383	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.412475768008	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.496122038631	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.503209078137	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.497618830428	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.499110282831	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.500970846946	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.591789095704	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.498673510456	That is important.
0.0	0.49504668723	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.502673713025	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.503532555184	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.498826444891	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.50506243503	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
1.0	0.511040090753	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.49530362886	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.496859430212	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.506930401002	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.496260420391	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.503864452954	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.506551607636	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.490876355353	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.497250931874	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.497219886252	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.49931106071	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.493713358465	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.496315016961	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.488326633355	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.501674818568	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.497498570531	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.495360155924	I would change them.
0.0	0.502403110381	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.493038390424	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.49802505839	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.506205012935	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.49315758245	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.496515095978	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.499336881903	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.489799947216	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.492920952624	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.495840679357	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.502435433498	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.498995959767	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.470496837461	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.505666003325	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.505733599821	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.496545548504	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.49702998477	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.501282888709	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.499741283319	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.498489674801	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.504624612769	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.501092395273	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.498984588741	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.501482445918	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.494467275918	No their not.
0.0	0.501472898399	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.497861423982	They're a scam.
0.0	0.410532985401	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.496640099284	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.499360052262	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.494691108761	Okay.
0.0	0.503598594714	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.499343009804	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.492576553313	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.491648277496	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.498160565703	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.49606719655	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.497287453077	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.495929761949	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.493460096198	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.495153746422	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.494691108761	I've done it.
0.0	0.490978065332	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.490733563924	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.404952511706	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.497467001228	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.493602538168	I can do that.
1.0	0.489617402839	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.497992293733	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.497687522236	We were wrong.
0.0	0.495479958386	You're right.
1.0	0.511530611921	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.411386529668	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.502400978051	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.474061043865	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.501542136633	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.499573280628	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.50117175585	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.495223998604	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.497621482939	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.500380788088	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.500333873916	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.491691453848	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.593675940885	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.500473812075	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.500511429551	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.494396184789	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.500309602645	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.497141427269	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.497792957246	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.492152070599	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.496907924422	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.500585193305	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
1.0	0.488498953915	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.493005804285	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.501036973227	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.498652566338	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.496718645152	Well, I did.
0.0	0.407653239195	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.50042782776	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.501407360322	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.497970864756	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.491580646735	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.493486681367	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.501798744475	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.501797928264	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.500080804614	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.486044106185	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.495957048805	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.594475875171	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.492173103156	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.491691453848	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.498547959591	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.503474109123	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.437862352055	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.495929761949	No, you did.
0.0	0.504118841332	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.497861423982	Yeah, they are unhinged.
1.0	0.505006831802	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.518607901625	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.409257308557	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.499302800374	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.494502174745	And we are not England.
0.0	0.500822205071	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.498756928319	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.507567831012	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.485467619756	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.500225615011	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.496779425672	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.417029533083	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.494875867568	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.493750125646	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.498876316467	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.492344886853	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.491620387052	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.501012991758	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.500825580672	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.500008576853	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.498781010145	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.500840164296	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.498312881265	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.494691108761	How do I know this?
0.0	0.591985750454	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.501495965398	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.503467093629	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.496410870996	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.494426635629	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.493715117419	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.58665802577	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.503773941352	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.524616667533	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.506972254099	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.49754360851	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.498547959591	You count on it.
0.0	0.501234394106	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.504625057373	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.505108927606	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.500344065746	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.505794449421	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.493713358465	And you know what?
0.0	0.499200513159	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.499963643416	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.495567610275	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.41355294039	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.489396896196	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.509336984944	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.498169148639	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.502737084951	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.494149052294	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.49173320748	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.420873981605	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.4923548565	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.4972233906	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.497459257158	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.491324843162	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.493952216814	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.499230281044	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.409558540908	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.498547959591	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.494691108761	See?
0.0	0.504133611825	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.498751887583	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.502186307529	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.496772735539	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.500885455209	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.498803245535	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.502480688615	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.499360052262	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.501817712802	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.508249469952	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.497796065322	But we stuck to our message.
1.0	0.516857037633	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.505124281672	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.48757917587	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.50051445054	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.497935962267	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.497935263415	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.503632094901	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.498670275932	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.495130859623	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.498939043571	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.499895443381	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.4977017937	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.507813637463	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.497857802463	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.495595722065	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.501400210821	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.504088993022	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.521050515301	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.505630013377	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.496062689964	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.496570835367	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.503573450291	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.498547959591	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.498348622735	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.499491756183	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.410015449016	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.40111017714	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.505794181588	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.494691108761	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.500698201644	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.495131539529	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.501851823328	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.505363607795	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.407561320158	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.498379295183	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.501786733595	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.507963147247	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.417446667437	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.496657371232	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.492380666351	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.494993485227	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.496210756246	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.506608439475	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.494856587394	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
1.0	0.502537550455	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.506560066899	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.585965922738	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.417743611117	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.489444639498	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.495826106717	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.492377903535	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.499809988313	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.498544338037	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.487320115328	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.50150139333	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.499208326341	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.500874042178	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.495479958386	Dynamically.
0.0	0.494504400606	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.406468648571	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.49987929424	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.497861423982	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.5022677172	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.501790410056	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
1.0	0.497068896928	That's wrong.
0.0	0.588462516668	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.496164253734	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.504256928621	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.501991966875	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.498670275932	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.494691108761	Yes.
0.0	0.499131154217	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.502254150974	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.500623336079	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.496513247306	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.5840228704	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.500272015123	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.490681599669	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.496835817723	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.496419842745	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.499668256051	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.524023114367	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.428064708086	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.499000626611	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.412434103125	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.500393410589	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.50017981922	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.503489048825	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.501759766905	Well, let us level with the American people.
1.0	0.508246300768	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.495484968531	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.496718645152	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.494691108761	No.
1.0	0.501092933968	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.497314678289	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.498312743987	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.501397068191	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.499407744954	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.497099875483	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.497721436647	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.502942174739	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.495450063604	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.495839168818	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.493183478015	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.500459502761	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.505736317869	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.494691108761	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.499151839115	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.496570835367	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.409004562695	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.495039908621	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.495740818975	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.494135505624	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.469342000667	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.496640099284	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.501174562162	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.50121568031	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.49922135221	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.496973630247	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.498690136662	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.500768256115	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.495139673556	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.506515384774	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.499114470276	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.526839501769	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.490192865817	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.4991258757	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.495710991226	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.504493896243	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.494496595007	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.495000797002	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.495468883882	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.496413359911	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.49631419438	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.499302800374	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.498572137567	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.524968800951	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.406383589556	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
1.0	0.502991657097	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.496353606155	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.49402489246	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.498861225455	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.492751091532	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.521730744758	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.500371311119	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.494237725334	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.496516868714	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.50631437034	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.410995070708	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.506121989594	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.500607604664	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.491231925924	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.499763909425	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.494577757632	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.504043248204	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.498376611652	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.501772388981	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.498444613791	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.501011482104	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.493602538168	You can have him.
0.0	0.50728831416	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.49901845618	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.499635353637	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.493378562171	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.496413359911	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.499022635618	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.500244504197	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.494519779147	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.498673510456	The world has changed.
0.0	0.496655485367	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.502356407602	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.496901175052	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.491655693548	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.502503371109	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.505635703764	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.504633349629	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.497555817822	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.49509877905	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.498680366882	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.500419474269	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.498312308044	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.500980044834	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.501851823328	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.489205637581	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.502330136566	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.500512033686	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.501908823139	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.505801362738	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.478842476341	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.497637569362	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.597264791666	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.501897914202	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.495546077212	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.492729124218	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.497798580709	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.494608001925	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.499069387961	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.501064561131	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.497935962267	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.505180469993	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.506491680873	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.49803956867	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.494691108761	Yes.
0.0	0.495479958386	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.487777457398	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.495581757106	Big difference.
0.0	0.496946369403	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.501391358704	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.500631407144	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.501812195593	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.499240974962	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.497028481825	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.497459257158	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.498638218783	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.50153071572	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.511544845287	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.493713358465	And you know what?
0.0	0.498276745875	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.505791170773	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.494135505624	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.494691108761	OK.
0.0	0.496895552567	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.498676041115	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.498676041115	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.587468636437	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.496111925219	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.494804935573	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.50150139333	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.510609560773	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.503025959957	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.499884351481	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.497803860776	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.414768466179	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.494428464766	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.493457870448	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.493457870448	We don't need that.
0.0	0.490186947631	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.502599973943	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.50042782776	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.495586726205	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.499895197699	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.503662563752	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.496657371232	We need sound money.
0.0	0.504555959375	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.492734533632	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.403189321442	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.496231927205	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.495967634721	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.413104510989	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.499775956597	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
1.0	0.505309999502	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.49907270548	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.491280592416	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.493355506815	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.493713358465	And you know what?
0.0	0.497953547615	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.501296725703	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.504210884966	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.499759091463	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.502009454881	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.505017321712	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.497530448035	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.489508145868	...John...
0.0	0.495554180669	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.499573280628	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.505592604992	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.50052351556	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.485139478518	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.540428978007	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.49909253046	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.498682482603	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.495929761949	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.493358349252	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.409986373341	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.502031919384	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.495373964233	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.495687281931	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.497857802463	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.497406166302	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.507809614609	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.489337228527	Maria, I'd just like to say...
1.0	0.500773655918	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.49428493087	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.415058391628	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.496718645152	We actually did it.
0.0	0.493431232671	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.497892403032	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.476224786198	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.408958743255	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.486972445964	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.499483713808	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.588773151645	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.406485218079	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.50185911211	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.498673510456	That's fine.
0.0	0.414559550119	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.494917061984	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.497857802463	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.497716155776	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.504885832302	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.50137217154	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.49988909974	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.50084186557	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.497777899681	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.572534269506	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.50386759942	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.496094592802	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.491530136968	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.502929696681	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.580967193158	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.494502174745	And so do I.
0.0	0.493309430362	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.404404915265	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.492718603953	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.528927799968	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.501837217306	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.421062916409	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.406647463616	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.487697151966	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.588739247599	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.415737519708	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.495263651004	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
1.0	0.503770013621	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.437783084566	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.492140869746	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.496207867856	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.498310711649	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.587731720671	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.504531097803	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.503662135248	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.535246529982	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.500484947137	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.501928635949	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
1.0	0.505823633422	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.50343027297	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.496267984728	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.493395321996	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.431240482383	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.499932691326	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.493300490754	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.499786718316	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.526370648807	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.506069914104	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.496329198431	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.499772842711	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.492138656397	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.493346703404	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.408235401826	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
1.0	0.49946858581	Very few children.
0.0	0.493385376924	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.496127342603	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.434441292339	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.499357754545	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.497352557507	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
1.0	0.504051262496	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.495377585508	I agree with them.
0.0	0.514587677017	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.495595313193	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.490281822168	You looking at me?
0.0	0.498547959591	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.494962772999	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.

0.0	0.496628049893	I think the times are much more serious.
1.0	0.496923716036	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.499302462855	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.

0.0	0.593982257748	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.497203386101	In addition to that...

1.0	0.500575644053	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.493602538168	I can.
0.0	0.408595228111	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.

0.0	0.507879931316	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.492065088151	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.50147621402	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.496718645152	I never said that.
0.0	0.499895404114	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.497900453235	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.503392696338	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.495450063604	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.4160083276	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.501023289406	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.498171378378	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.495505657373	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.498473262533	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.496900377996	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.505357387823	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.407967456676	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.502785293883	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.500777301266	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.496245640975	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.411968554245	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.491324843162	I think you're --
0.0	0.495752679371	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
1.0	0.596299923403	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.507423303948	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.501661852626	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.498884562777	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.499786718316	He was on the board.

0.0	0.497307175423	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.

0.0	0.497337738899	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.499709823112	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.491718555422	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.420439423607	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.494747783123	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.494519679099	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.503745240668	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.601306121701	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.498502726091	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.499179651855	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.494426635629	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.496566276426	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.498345726565	I know every one.
0.0	0.49490531438	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.496525673257	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.506631361647	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.500058185532	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.41326288987	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.499360052262	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.501601226237	You find me...
0.0	0.495377585508	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.49167921226	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.499763977113	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.499658833231	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.505204737807	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.48828410396	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.499462433555	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.495024438386	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.496757726485	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.504152469437	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.494691108761	No.
0.0	0.484975651857	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.491321222667	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.500278630501	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.529457760625	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.40142312597	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.503526004318	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
1.0	0.492421746095	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.49988909974	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.499049859262	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.49377279246	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.471550855308	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.496718645152	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.496396095084	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.470180778427	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.488338926577	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.504458361337	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.497690077813	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.498911219369	But I was born here.
0.0	0.502002153527	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.494851285902	In all due respect...
0.0	0.497726620528	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.497068896928	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.502771112952	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.397165701552	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.520835489555	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.494691108761	We have no borders.
0.0	0.495287227067	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.497861423982	I win.
0.0	0.496343168593	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.492874777087	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.498849167917	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.493821202214	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.499815052037	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.499793232079	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.500601345093	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.501889962474	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.495295588966	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.499366204514	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.504694954978	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.500772606193	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.506608716332	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
1.0	0.506484584696	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.49727336847	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.491432751482	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.504358696941	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.49335280883	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.500879095312	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.499496458821	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.49944129063	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.502944647699	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.494687487585	That's not right.
1.0	0.493420312563	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.497857802463	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.493898664522	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.495228026935	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.503600743057	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.496583787795	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.489143431008	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.595861042747	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.498789104648	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.50239350861	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.501712743897	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.495377585508	Think about that.
0.0	0.496390644453	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.495115219334	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.496569874226	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.496054718809	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.498547959591	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.499664248314	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.491666488735	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.497861423982	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.493714445383	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.496900023471	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.508821764132	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.504684786787	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.496821048142	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.503292610156	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.496718645152	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.493468304989	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.496714092826	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.4943118422	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.495377585508	Think about it.
0.0	0.49758769866	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.495697671293	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.497861423982	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.498153279649	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.431679992642	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.482362446768	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.499723314079	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.494689882278	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.495870146298	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.496141406153	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.497154661707	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.499119475041	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.494364907252	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.488896767371	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.499819647655	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.49848817745	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.578815572602	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.492600459847	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.500081402115	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.590659805692	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.508562267979	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.502758679876	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
1.0	0.500575644053	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.496507308894	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.49448538025	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.497866299206	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.50431534833	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
1.0	0.498048879303	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.501081745968	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.494687487585	It goes away.
0.0	0.501435361159	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.523083160294	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.494032006139	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.496179378472	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.511856260423	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.497005212572	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.502293518145	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.495345139311	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.488344372244	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.501417886596	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.503689157748	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.494716149045	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.496093212596	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.499777380489	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.502756840733	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.498277490768	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.502957845923	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.499015063509	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.494585117931	That's for sure.
0.0	0.49916626149	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.594369276947	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.503135323399	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.496328503491	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.498378559746	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.497857802463	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.501620401608	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.49742237015	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.497732772663	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.494974810512	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.499744542182	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.497857802463	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.495407248127	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.498132800686	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.501322780829	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.491018966188	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.492582689554	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.504785618127	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.408758704074	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.493346703404	...
0.0	0.497861423982	They're a scam.
0.0	0.502610233962	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.500200392372	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
1.0	0.502903385661	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.501113024484	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.498478649623	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.494691108761	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.492270091048	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.503170347789	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.505310664917	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.497946670811	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.493244597757	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.416130661009	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.498499504411	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
1.0	0.595163876497	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.496732026499	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.499746088394	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.499732260445	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.491156984251	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.50105313143	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.497922103032	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.507601707011	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.411432979993	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.499803673574	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.509477572736	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.412784571968	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.498118377061	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.494018945979	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.412223550413	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.495492789836	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.473429691864	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.494691108761	You're welcome.
0.0	0.494691108761	They know.
0.0	0.49102262111	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.505562395521	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.486655012019	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.498650340223	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.498420783428	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.503884565868	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.498601328099	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.414956946046	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.506589057305	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.405995408878	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.499661528023	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.489959654687	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.500575171014	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.501585390391	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.503090555229	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.405378329756	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.494777458009	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.497459257158	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.499993508622	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.500136945231	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.497929354187	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.491623068814	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.494599514042	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.505408584308	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.506641465831	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.504677313364	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.485355505273	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.494691108761	You know why?
0.0	0.499491756183	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.497595793023	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.49542131673	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
1.0	0.50609247564	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.49797900155	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.524778954299	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.493602538168	I will do that.
0.0	0.493447154303	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.50198556049	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.5028893411	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.496227250873	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
1.0	0.496342805156	In the past he has called him weak.
1.0	0.505077587138	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.496834324648	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.501929413957	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.492953410209	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.500284303567	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.499569659046	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.495211741544	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.494951961475	And, we said no.
0.0	0.496432950279	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.408002720936	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.498153279649	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.527985644593	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.499573280628	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.495026171045	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.498396856313	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.505569657187	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.492232713568	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.502414435219	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.500118052514	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.498650340223	We don't win.
0.0	0.493460096198	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.497887124593	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.495043830853	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.495514159837	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.486204282321	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
1.0	0.490832313639	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.507166957551	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.500254980915	Not bad.
1.0	0.499766984388	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.492842248876	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.513927717452	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.495908328007	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.497145166429	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.495869223339	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.490982509007	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.498097266331	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.509945832188	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.491906399803	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.497085448792	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.494455796986	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.495479958386	We haven't.
0.0	0.496563359728	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.500796258089	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.5000105726	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.498309420292	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.499839051531	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.494496219828	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.493346703404	...
0.0	0.407165864151	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.496742668839	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.49726852586	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.39997229394	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.500757849736	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.50543900356	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.494494593631	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.496681597731	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.481550276831	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.491647048511	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.498573660454	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.482728544289	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.499492489454	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
1.0	0.504565938236	It looked like very few women.
1.0	0.511300013704	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.491465657147	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.585936100789	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.499912270138	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.496477789877	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.506619150913	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.403407475859	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.493527125825	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.492114586971	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.504404378739	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.50393592352	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.496772735539	That will change everything.
0.0	0.498573479448	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.417422835524	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.493791587745	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.416673781522	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.498902269629	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.418729651769	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.494943042827	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.495893053682	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.505823750732	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.504686861681	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.500597191618	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.499650209319	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.494519779147	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.503596101215	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.493898664522	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.502184936719	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.495360155924	Nobody can deny them.
1.0	0.504532042384	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.490513481863	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.49983457501	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.51201971511	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.500423095851	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.500922071452	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.499466055136	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.494836529467	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.500015211367	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.503675732569	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.597984965534	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.496859901733	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.495593013635	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.497463770474	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.490418343285	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.499256158488	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.49622652922	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.498654044005	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.498547959591	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.501953410438	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.41550464295	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.497235404304	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.497861423982	(inaudible).
0.0	0.497682019063	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.495638330366	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.499395199146	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.494361456829	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.493171021707	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.497283053985	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.497633002446	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.501175916014	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.494691108761	OK?
0.0	0.496098198795	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.406295093898	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.592689777866	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.49454865944	Well, thank you very much.
1.0	0.509113207847	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.496866958922	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.497115559805	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.494016108323	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.509443847327	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.490593477412	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.498072578372	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.499178917918	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.498650340223	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.503849960029	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.495304488271	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.501234545363	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.494687487585	It never happens.
0.0	0.496293437547	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.501029960089	That never works.
0.0	0.506297768173	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.518833461627	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.496795176243	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.499089673997	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.498876316467	My name was mentioned here.
1.0	0.515054408122	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.500743450898	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.497861423982	I'm tested.
0.0	0.498146271566	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.503840603742	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.478539894749	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.50169227335	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.489623463137	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.491605783207	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.499482681439	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.505213357187	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.497270306323	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.502716980066	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.495377585508	They're off to China.
0.0	0.494073078307	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.495479958386	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.411781010692	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.422042959975	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.510691400027	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.495724369001	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.500041329663	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.494296068729	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.487387657245	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.411681803728	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.502452425032	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.4013246341	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.491109295994	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.505759926015	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.593020253293	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.49446060879	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.494687487585	It never happens.
0.0	0.497749616722	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.499100174705	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.495998149328	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.499100174705	I was the architect.
0.0	0.495815597492	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.593923888984	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.496592801526	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.496565998201	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.504339024851	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.497451269814	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.495021109194	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.499922915281	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.497160653501	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.499175483276	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.497962209522	That is our government today.
0.0	0.494309195429	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.489969491211	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.504915411554	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.494691108761	OK?
0.0	0.50153748178	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.497237697062	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.495420110565	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.492554313524	That is...
0.0	0.499336881903	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.502511772402	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.499117757742	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.511658678332	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
1.0	0.418921876106	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.528315216122	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.496810145338	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.500508703453	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.499661528023	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.494691108761	You know why?
0.0	0.501605047268	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.495479958386	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.509147840346	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.502946863817	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.49732428186	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.497156904818	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.487753800663	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.497861423982	to save a company.
0.0	0.495778334335	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.526903955054	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.482163488644	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.498217027559	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.412227371452	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.49576263037	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.496070695706	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.489903649341	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.494691108761	Check it out.
0.0	0.501597759551	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.500873645821	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.494001690781	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.525202331567	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.503886881895	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.595093664469	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.496883569207	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.495455481094	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.496011779891	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.499752196292	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.499536109632	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.489508145868	...Chris...
0.0	0.588507827495	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.499616340854	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.500412058333	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.497231575347	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.496607857118	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.491231925924	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.49630634433	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.415723861521	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.50396318285	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.493053215583	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.500157094648	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
1.0	0.507609893097	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.50092277198	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.583398963397	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
1.0	0.499069105042	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.497272841089	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.498149535885	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.494691108761	No, no.
0.0	0.439744994211	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.503270108491	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.496983697525	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.498180208166	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.497312825485	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
1.0	0.502802677604	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.495058084426	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.496295103353	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.493207945139	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.50160064616	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."

0.0	0.50156504775	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.503109623326	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.508040726376	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.493713358465	And you know what?
0.0	0.505845420091	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
1.0	0.511891257717	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.492975903934	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.495782781917	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.501984381286	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.500214390073	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.494288981971	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.498865494955	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.432834844111	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
1.0	0.499162977103	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.499351386419	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.

1.0	0.513561311929	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.497068896928	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.505610930388	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.499573280628	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.525833138365	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.503366986608	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.490023480534	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.502163661704	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.496957853598	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.49511310497	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.490277930403	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.499516246898	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.403753491064	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.495498989612	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.501386752823	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.49433125511	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.504154335231	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.497068896928	The answer is no.
0.0	0.503540438964	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.504940291667	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.496718645152	What have you got now?
0.0	0.495360224729	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.494691108761	You know that.
0.0	0.494691108761	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.504647006591	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.496766245624	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.500204312609	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.496595048462	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.499783096731	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.493609708317	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.502291965375	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.496901175052	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.594191200117	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.413477780138	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.498648007215	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.415523682947	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.404564303712	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.493103172174	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.496253925557	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.499690070965	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.496347764415	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.489734386779	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.498296026821	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.491600661194	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.504126414815	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.494691108761	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.490970169615	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.508895498076	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.494687487585	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.504925452977	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.500516038009	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.506441608805	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.499423936441	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.492219566971	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.40953578211	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.523180263432	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.514041973486	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.49909045098	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.419725067985	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.500555033554	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.501033581659	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.496989284933	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.494763584895	I have no illusion.
1.0	0.499100174705	They were wrong.
0.0	0.49619064548	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.500307295969	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.501343895573	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.503072101567	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.525729007069	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.590147917874	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.492632120407	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.406988503195	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.4977017937	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.502617362144	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.495650226421	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.494504400606	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.405147685564	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.497267018837	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.497561636056	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.502659834522	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.501090262087	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.525757405417	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.49988909974	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.513942676512	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.500259825069	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
1.0	0.499761351005	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.403284089861	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.48355931493	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.513151360421	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.465406962863	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.497924225453	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.501638706402	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.499473190274	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.502774733344	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.501266169257	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.501374702198	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.493887918913	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.498260204282	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.496650223532	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.498974984839	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.495636546425	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.498416432923	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.497381847307	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.502355016569	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.494819487644	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.495999352808	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.50227233028	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.500430617223	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.528571653667	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.497660739248	That's my bill.
0.0	0.495479958386	Say again?
0.0	0.496588970273	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.414147630676	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.500604966672	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.504129837579	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.501119047056	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.502688530565	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.504432776404	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.497861423982	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.494763584895	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.469692246146	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.484751197329	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.497794117075	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.506294870489	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.495077818612	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.498489674801	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?

0.0	0.485775401613	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.595022313675	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.

0.0	0.495794731344	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.408527801953	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.

0.0	0.497010818354	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.496772735539	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.409603409824	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.412253455011	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.492111060369	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.50343027297	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.

0.0	0.505658674524	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.505756407941	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.493602538168	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.407031040118	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.495694673766	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.531725082572	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.501772828709	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.49353034237	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.497068896928	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.489113793246	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.495377585508	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.498898200097	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.500470094364	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.504825552806	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.496616268265	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.490570142123	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.499741283319	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.491726968105	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.497293476037	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.474592823144	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.493804453367	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.494541404558	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.496525673257	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.494362905887	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.495554662706	We can't do this unilaterally.
1.0	0.507423564463	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.4977017937	And for good cause.
0.0	0.495790984591	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.502137292763	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.503769617877	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.526439314192	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.49616370795	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.49605615998	It's their money.
0.0	0.595753015923	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.501033581659	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.526208526424	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.495879301492	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.496516868714	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.503375251513	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.502832029087	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.497821596644	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.492731762882	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.4987339775	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.501642767489	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.502426212943	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.493051239457	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.494904317843	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.498129452444	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.499199444971	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.503582445915	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.495641025121	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.492443338977	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.418635935046	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.494920923667	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.49738763902	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.497935736559	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.505713260623	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.593658187449	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.499303689773	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.498650340223	I totally get that.
0.0	0.499362582934	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.49805592742	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.504622700506	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.491580646735	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.504428265256	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.416397738604	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.414018515181	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.595244782647	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.496485822364	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.503528887104	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.494278379418	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.505161747674	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.502149349659	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.495951299804	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.494621573997	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.50110536074	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.498676041115	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.492205135323	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.497967956167	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.505836998746	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.497460646518	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.503525303988	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.500120319918	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.504097350091	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.

0.0	0.493174325982	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.495377585508	About Medicare?
0.0	0.411570776842	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.500067006304	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.493591253058	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.497519091871	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.32300330293	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.412974648067	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.498338470907	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.492602346582	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
1.0	0.497379088254	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.50025392265	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.497135318869	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.410499335767	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.502533524987	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.489140085432	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.497715778346	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
1.0	0.497672471667	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.498997790551	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.491044859586	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.489891772628	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.495984371314	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.502945796198	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.493059942425	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.497120559752	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.509816020188	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.412613760014	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.497810072868	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.49433153294	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.498635008344	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.499568202108	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.491656560454	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.499540142125	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.487979751313	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.498916933748	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.495482184335	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.503672196759	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.494209236653	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.493364041484	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.503266945004	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.404291986444	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.504686242	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.493614508974	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.495657756829	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.499661528023	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.499380324159	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.499205941552	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.492177292928	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.497068896928	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.502875861666	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.497303065885	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.49152857591	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.494471996267	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.49466663223	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.501940701251	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.501955290058	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.500523037153	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.497443739033	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.494585117931	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.495739713174	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.41259487026	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.587413873045	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.49902106355	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.495484116879	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.500416299111	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.498676041115	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.502566392317	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.504206699235	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.405417807099	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.509311433936	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.495943203176	And God bless America.
0.0	0.497817692809	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.499248632979	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.406753199012	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.496137254075	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.502470031129	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.498951321902	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.501449319011	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.502659834522	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.506422571118	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.497561636056	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.498126648511	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.493358690881	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.49878107558	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.496003919286	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.494577254104	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.497887124593	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.496091060901	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.496879947763	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
1.0	0.497587403605	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.504386655814	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.499122797795	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.50471566495	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.499570454014	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.495716731798	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.500704817259	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.508619983806	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.489231248033	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.501426505363	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.503584678694	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.49597252092	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.40304104051	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.503096773526	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.498856261603	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.501491947481	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.494135505624	Again...
0.0	0.499260627125	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
1.0	0.494919880659	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.504242904394	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.495933008232	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.498622498596	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.49658174783	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.492514984834	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.493393096254	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.573624974554	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.502640733246	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.501370209918	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.492262173514	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.501505014882	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.49051386997	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.501560648831	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.493293959454	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.505591740868	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.502381127969	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.496914592372	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
1.0	0.503019631694	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.494101045649	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.496803713869	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.492369021153	But look...
0.0	0.497068896928	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.50043683194	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.437290371605	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.476463063355	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.492938555627	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.49656011789	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.40765363038	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.497191848568	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.495479958386	Absolutely.
0.0	0.498547959591	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.501785566653	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.493362252628	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.494691108761	We do.
0.0	0.502096865963	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.500284303567	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.495479958386	Right.
0.0	0.493674839935	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.502058490864	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.49513612951	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.501157377745	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.497857802463	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.495009752576	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.410166688188	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.503919948427	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.497068896928	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.500499770329	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.497196331465	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.497183834315	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.506617133872	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.497657865004	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.509035068845	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.49837987106	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.494691108761	Thank you.
0.0	0.499592169345	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.487519827086	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.49692916213	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.483634968901	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.499786718316	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.497331694939	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.49632544112	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.500610986417	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.496838681754	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.499517688456	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.497206602135	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.503575860225	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.49893438966	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.500254980915	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.502089600146	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.501867988448	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.51055192231	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.525327879834	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.500867308126	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.494691108761	No.
0.0	0.499291479964	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.502996612761	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.491495658566	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.502296999971	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.491654612636	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.499913235224	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.503586800196	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.506811034722	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.49730576445	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.498650340223	I don't care.

0.0	0.498232650126	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.493861211603	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.

0.0	0.493898664522	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.494391350288	You can't do nothing.
1.0	0.502901947222	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.524475333962	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.503777993532	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.505615568112	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.495761429215	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.494220818113	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.493602538168	What should we do?
0.0	0.499685363016	He has never defended...
0.0	0.496195775887	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.

0.0	0.498328837045	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.500927547311	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.

0.0	0.497660739248	No, it's your record.

0.0	0.5029431207	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.496570835367	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.500285800932	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.495289484371	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.

0.0	0.503400523739	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.491486226136	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.494709367375	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.493848715881	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.497166222187	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.

0.0	0.496883569207	And we have to take on ISIS online.

0.0	0.491450370215	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.501171503619	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.498650340223	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.485971748622	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.497099875483	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.503524196584	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.496225894801	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.404971988653	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.499783096731	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.49232905282	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
1.0	0.498141731923	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.495479958386	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.504062183765	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.490249078807	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.501809551877	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.496062689964	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.490177085749	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.491769673942	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.496525673257	I want to take care of women.

0.0	0.508296118334	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.493713358465	But you know what?
0.0	0.502291795631	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.505527851336	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.399131237232	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.493595029708	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.50124607395	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.499496458821	Of course not.
0.0	0.407509229369	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.50785118302	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.497340271711	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.496455650897	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.505528618489	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.501571897841	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.503306639138	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.490884408714	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.498004654053	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.416465974766	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.496144268126	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.498384608245	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.494655777906	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.497820271695	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.493898664522	It's true.
0.0	0.501312315111	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.488715974262	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.496448802668	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.504114589228	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.502623595024	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.496994514163	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.504077135523	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.411070727786	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.529490241815	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.496178269394	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.524451479806	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.477957244653	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.493346703404	Maria...
0.0	0.497878480104	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.497755422998	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.491391745437	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.507031020259	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.500837301814	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.499661528023	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.506271879657	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.5013608086	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.414059785035	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.597255500418	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.497739167398	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.501577671116	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.499997251684	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.491864363526	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.500692095336	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.412546144562	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.502562148816	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.48308332642	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.511275292482	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.499496920246	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.500988936044	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.505522378789	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.498120213633	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.495931287826	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.499032266306	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.498446066961	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.494518409048	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.499532824422	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.499396147678	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.49070939182	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.505979227876	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.493346703404	...
0.0	0.494040977074	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.595163876497	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.495377585508	Wait for what?
0.0	0.499805177141	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.495479958386	Absolutely.
0.0	0.49916626149	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.506627171884	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.413526724194	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.498568177311	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.495549219922	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.494028882469	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.498212783606	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.496384726758	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.500529151875	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.506056395959	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.414643357621	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.495547852917	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.504323255252	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.501117678416	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.500314795598	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.499580357951	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.577190026627	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.495377585508	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.491665094253	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.498547959591	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.502088669744	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.494691108761	I do.
0.0	0.489483238346	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.49783048073	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.503711225246	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.495126936531	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.505927150975	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.497654723807	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.469275804597	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.491145087705	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.496795176243	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.496462272122	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.499712654293	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.494762192113	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.416019656497	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.502709640213	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.495839168818	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.414336951791	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.466111660685	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.498508314469	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.49393697388	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.495346673896	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.491430859608	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.497672471667	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.407567803952	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.504455448377	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
1.0	0.501617097427	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.491365556979	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.495482184335	You really can't.
0.0	0.492751759494	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.495756608873	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.491315621587	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.497487528789	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
