0.0	0.354118539563	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.188951695379	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.343711519744	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.51402291096	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.488260445642	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.335656803502	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.244557322843	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.505717602457	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.287703706	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.270979824713	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.261767797459	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.416087451252	That's right.
0.0	0.572206318122	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.39772565906	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.228475375704	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.474921044104	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.5	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.430125387408	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.424388256736	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.332310155684	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.535143629041	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.19480275026	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.440240470217	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
1.0	0.622804900553	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.201935936946	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.575928862174	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.551857912376	They're a scam.

0.0	0.384678473382	You know that.
0.0	0.202316393842	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.415287332566	Good at email.
0.0	0.281304881858	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.771231649516	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.46200129962	I think that's a major accomplishment.

0.0	0.425194789421	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.459573704962	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.263504213822	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.2845081288	Here's the thing.
1.0	0.436919882522	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.901807437576	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
1.0	0.185846748099	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.243063469445	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.445051720687	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.434884776061	I never said that.
0.0	0.482476800087	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.572996327007	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.414605055544	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.372962306863	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.5	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.26094856883	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.566650067562	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.176210787281	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.288686753543	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.40083223066	No, you did.
0.0	0.303565892759	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.350452365835	Thank you.
0.0	0.249212695199	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.360222014644	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.233988829854	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.506080269902	I said no.
0.0	0.458094796957	You target the bad guys.
1.0	0.630998740901	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.235557050367	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.296966161032	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.409168834661	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.634894241814	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.867251322879	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.532853307077	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.382022566197	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.402784365956	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.468892312861	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.844186175331	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.137903464283	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.553590999655	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.457860691139	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.473163854895	I'm tested.
0.0	0.260266581841	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.455559301727	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.359054830335	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.469584262178	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.239195698682	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.121073095962	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.285689461346	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.410329878616	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.45840450899	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.5	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.419849912584	I love this country.
0.0	0.343208031135	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.54840528708	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.332783329565	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.480573922883	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.277628117928	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.896031272359	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.728480143008	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.323438670902	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.391044328466	Right.
0.0	0.341774742284	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.316539253832	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.677610962814	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.342936778067	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.395665805486	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.570344618847	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.349802732969	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.316603216864	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.279474076895	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.0871964801198	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.303408727371	Wait for what?
0.0	0.471963218661	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.230330987364	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.574411947552	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.441816908718	It was.
0.0	0.346474680717	You know why?
0.0	0.823782594798	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.297866065882	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.444328080329	We are lowering taxes on small business.
1.0	0.994151511254	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.515681167927	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.454995966747	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.360241843072	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.5	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.348807399136	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.412525839969	That is not right.
0.0	0.520429422948	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.182126037039	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.244885099498	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.423658517784	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.507200455061	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.651445917263	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.624155204916	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.282678592839	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.250283436663	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.194337218737	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.430657075262	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.540397573523	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.459597327259	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.303207818065	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.292917023872	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.318133995616	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.677692888296	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.341973638018	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.637807333046	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.248258849257	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.327732276235	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.369413764512	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.474693798055	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.319636136391	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.539600276351	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.471560662924	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.457760814923	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.462318100111	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.678810775126	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
1.0	0.623327298178	It looked like very few women.
1.0	0.879140991583	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.5	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.344924079836	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.450191490431	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.390236551707	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.38380832925	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.288452009877	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.455938202988	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.328308123277	We need sound money.
0.0	0.311848783982	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.479364064668	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.729611307909	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.329980981769	So you might not.
0.0	0.383367825259	She said the truth.
0.0	0.663059845267	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.617280802342	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.566219403411	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.411284899863	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.339446515398	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.430064726832	You get together.
0.0	0.214031670163	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
1.0	0.452392505493	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.427137342836	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.213114721445	The number of women --
0.0	0.432532682478	You know, that's so simple.
1.0	0.533623424037	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.696525739268	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.47537837566	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.408513665739	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.445878938685	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.142254233624	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.5	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.349363817549	I promise.
0.0	0.738729358836	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.

1.0	0.691525173603	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.295823978971	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.424753043288	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.32238871188	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.358232332549	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.675622542054	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.57585591473	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.428042634336	It goes away.

0.0	0.417938476935	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.437724976075	My background is different.
0.0	0.729183298408	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.

0.0	0.185203413852	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.359451659235	That's good.
0.0	0.403351993597	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.

0.0	0.507321070362	They're protectionist.

0.0	0.342192574459	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.345427712308	My point is this.
0.0	0.553688870721	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.455940457635	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.37034488355	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.628097168759	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.345069312763	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.266833598787	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.393715003454	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?

0.0	0.549484810237	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.442350794325	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.333171807457	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.21576095219	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.355543317934	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.240159007349	But...
0.0	0.457883224763	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.262126624387	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.39223584506	You do.
0.0	0.792506159417	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.437951249169	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.5	You just don't make promises like this.

0.0	0.439568257726	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.139544655388	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.345024686226	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.41785945584	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.33091663818	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.196297323011	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.48344951709	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.

0.0	0.650807352833	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.538255442768	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.17869525219	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.423977351357	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.216655938745	We need to have stronger families.

0.0	0.409123433949	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.556806360042	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.

0.0	0.346436100364	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.276685978567	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.572676088422	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.529077126409	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.404948267284	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.493040468851	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.721241333701	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.595299196563	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.230947956694	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.5970410971	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.627376946633	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.434884776061	I never said that.

0.0	0.680136160791	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.419726462446	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.554247304265	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.44368305517	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.515040874531	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.44700225798	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.511688138754	You've got to give people hope.
1.0	0.637669244636	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.374729285722	We have a lot of work to do.

0.0	0.234696863966	It's true.
0.0	0.471021754136	We both have a lot of small donors.
1.0	0.514509809256	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.390485391386	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.577459684905	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.350901739841	Illegal.
0.0	0.207745629482	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.339794655842	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.299234595382	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.358775034419	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.291044670278	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.361230180568	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.270297534372	What should we do?
0.0	0.351434392384	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.126514772167	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.336928060277	...Thank you.
0.0	0.188236204012	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.610016521723	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.487801286799	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.140636637663	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.243862660343	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.518613755782	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.381350164169	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.448118591099	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.113268469595	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.336403495978	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.650713438633	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.18358889984	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.621183319438	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.242914244151	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.460349332878	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.546802271875	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.442346440463	I know every one.
0.0	0.402275911739	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.28175040903	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.176262551677	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.333787435887	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.313223501592	...John...
0.0	0.602096349661	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.46038888831	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.639662541924	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.623865006304	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.350824482033	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.263901169807	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.247200967257	This country is changing.
0.0	0.592900574525	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.468525166446	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
1.0	0.462096581911	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.319989355107	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.369573525679	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.426287811625	That is important.
0.0	0.156405668683	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.213067932455	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.787421492795	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.203033934494	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.382701184801	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.

0.0	0.439049145395	Unless you are clinically insane...

0.0	0.177601700652	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.

0.0	0.441816908718	You did.
0.0	0.186972502086	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.

0.0	0.406065911111	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.333171807457	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.83778296618	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.379217100772	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.231809224653	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.361524986331	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.480242267901	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.571761035203	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.25740520665	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.797680596194	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.42818948819	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.332625047318	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.383556893833	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.0556053867844	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.422726744681	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.393167574416	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.351258553235	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.312127812932	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.389821947618	Creativity.
0.0	0.350452365835	Thank you.
0.0	0.203197524375	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.260408317501	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
1.0	0.884088337478	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.685501671486	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.203257092937	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.667093601815	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.394831776519	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.144845975023	...No, sir...
0.0	0.198391273405	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.126576064813	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.369001523767	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.301028401013	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.279322315314	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.436692030407	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.64437923875	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.135496986397	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.369727286715	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.417686043893	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.270746735729	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.249144624234	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.744749865774	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.852682281594	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.265566997809	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.725028390301	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.322291780486	No, no.
0.0	0.357880879136	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.484219877872	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.479913597499	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.35973924659	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.398419506603	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.406322072519	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.52739845169	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.551086114825	And you know what?
0.0	0.75874112064	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.460490708443	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.60766077665	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.253974797657	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.439841902903	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.425336885392	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.253257595368	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.347812855766	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.298549183853	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.436463876001	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.594094060474	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.294411166421	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.525785796991	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.506383013695	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.0408104213867	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.460171778146	slot.
0.0	0.547684877462	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.250127203008	...
0.0	0.477333857279	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.140566460341	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.28268390648	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.251733628748	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.223083575546	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.457477432878	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.615983896112	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.474822920811	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.246145127399	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.352436944303	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.367841009898	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.183158818042	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.466645892612	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.462007964609	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.296245552665	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.570249294189	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.353840383511	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.283051160173	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.392110744382	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.494752907486	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.419395360138	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.399337156459	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.136101185669	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.560829722119	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.391044328466	Right.
0.0	0.244763591185	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.461368026567	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.172774672703	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.212198043615	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.126257168921	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
1.0	0.239578579343	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.617878065183	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.422175427643	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.275690538931	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.466058304398	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.301537298853	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.791064945147	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.302033984	John, I'd like to address this?
1.0	0.134936527934	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.479394622288	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.712774134009	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.621841210367	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.360895322623	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.138252392706	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.164012940542	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.280999176037	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.656965428785	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.278283160222	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
1.0	0.0496505587629	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.251384679754	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.335132902909	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.583275627108	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.

0.0	0.211580439469	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.475136934439	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.354727325375	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.

0.0	0.251952838648	But look...
1.0	0.242288937839	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.553079785217	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.329859026052	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.195724827057	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.483632409591	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.3876856236	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.0909489695999	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.5	(inaudible).
0.0	0.64713037028	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.560869716403	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.284173935455	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.681876325059	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.641429333196	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.188167207842	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.231241986963	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.0512353101806	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.10766877758	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.536675407204	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.443566772066	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.264080413087	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.728106093233	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.412179842438	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.1819171329	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.547439181272	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.336871982569	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.453486717385	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.563291345005	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.294176156794	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.198954251994	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.240159007349	And...
0.0	0.570125822813	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.577966296234	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.485886182885	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.283783056648	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.510965868963	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.281779122887	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.283982551788	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.594457845983	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.136212464405	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.313671165356	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.975006693778	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.252939862786	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.272470339541	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.448187246629	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.478298869819	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.309955311007	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.423387336073	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.196632500571	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.629856599224	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.631198925938	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.18334866664	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.247754662059	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.539370546979	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.388995322039	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.457431099705	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.666951273958	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.312429268396	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.334231955401	That is...
0.0	0.28200666151	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.201094393359	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.281610023284	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.414998156258	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.29615402902	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.458176869451	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.699400568357	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.413091930258	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.287542700588	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.297646369632	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.211680857151	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.228539093418	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.443436999839	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.576635981682	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.356762396427	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.226993575661	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.341687165864	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.198769437817	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.429284576302	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.314185096729	Big difference.
0.0	0.206204527702	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.114711493252	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.549005778277	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
1.0	0.434251637761	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.309557289231	OK?
0.0	0.438179526493	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.270788390463	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.582559621491	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.197900676448	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.235782685358	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.370241684447	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.29273982045	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.472595277268	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.753351772467	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.335503115453	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.227977439776	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.100585971915	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.518879877228	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.198575785871	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.360432433427	...before I go.
0.0	0.264606674882	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.546345248965	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.282300315215	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.517837208119	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.417059181949	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.350133388956	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.46823272146	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.341187214554	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.545876816577	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.256419148781	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.597008414674	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.742557979377	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.187491716094	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.108675866945	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.253979908856	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.265778909516	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.5	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.51094136877	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.339293051582	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.385301757685	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.661714354786	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.228655963393	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.261197560384	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.268966810854	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.418944039151	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.369499097777	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.700369970005	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.347291951929	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.773312902101	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.453363235467	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.433958696977	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.668207448504	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.581314467549	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.359024277214	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.219858038551	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.401985524409	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.378433909541	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.397466917921	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.488807200931	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.419623770739	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.534219785328	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.217968443841	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.506115234163	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.236275791008	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.212561561462	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.260438322941	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.312531784962	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.506579919019	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.515404547056	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.349266061594	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.295145680526	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.417477098888	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.387604234543	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.766347046318	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.767759338546	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.227363183908	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.391044328466	Right.
0.0	0.53307776335	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.511645708331	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.250299084465	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.779621130021	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.50788500263	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.39824029917	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.42926194017	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.564575504817	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
1.0	0.529749438177	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.37101704122	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
1.0	0.763287410713	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.615850752662	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.342823736105	How about this?
0.0	0.447161594987	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.597190647282	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.555680394928	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.415970711821	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.452489915467	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.440470296785	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.314066627589	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.379735262196	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.263546470888	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.179641811376	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.298981027397	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.410808960153	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.431732158902	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.332078931139	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.224443792658	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.288022838068	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.400783294851	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
1.0	0.272879948426	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.417252549688	You know why three?
0.0	0.236093543275	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.43192553299	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.517730842417	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.22979952318	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.336944833029	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.553335399776	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.225877583657	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.494887167377	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.2238097471	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.554175309941	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.418137356841	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.203111851819	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.304862454123	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.

0.0	0.462755607281	I win.
0.0	0.399804529489	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.

0.0	0.47054105097	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.220771948531	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.437472997816	You really can't.
0.0	0.310523463121	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.482637463393	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.137526253845	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
1.0	0.906319604095	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.

0.0	0.478661283511	I strongly support the president's executive actions.

0.0	0.5	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.420312858664	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.315888037794	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.329760253851	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.444180948038	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.459356687386	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.446805690998	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.

0.0	0.412525839969	That's not right.
0.0	0.218573751022	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.276243353269	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.

0.0	0.446279070473	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.2845081288	Here's the thing.
1.0	0.75642610756	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.541161946579	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.617837655586	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.342620122169	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.5	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.439027749084	I've done it.
0.0	0.43943598035	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.294799571097	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.

0.0	0.459828100332	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.5	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.295734083783	But I would add this.
0.0	0.661123760299	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.195247513581	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.706371679184	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.205497936682	No, it's true.
0.0	0.47585832648	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.466406735405	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.406144922275	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.320875964253	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.146418492092	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.463977504313	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.605970345432	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.490224350922	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.5	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.319705215099	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.218323270071	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.509332479301	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.429306805725	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.162640108705	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.332016579447	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.166805172948	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.760993842318	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.47085534273	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.455137253462	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.580487851468	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.352472535517	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.466763746497	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.361153232805	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.414758774753	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.28255646952	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.608751642595	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.192858949249	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.385205077219	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.313535155213	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.481048690757	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.5	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.509252695777	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.364531315983	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.360309761796	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.0774928070035	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.517053153424	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.397569265968	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.156495488803	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.729631660025	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.458737555844	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.374581570252	I'm looking out for the American worker.
1.0	0.654150379682	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.444760890602	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.448624095744	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.455677192252	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.5	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.342703658415	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.371816650726	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.355741230759	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.428228116931	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.208235157004	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.373215230638	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.37546063516	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.124820723976	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.26090133359	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
1.0	0.725563484276	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.260914966975	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.105106504122	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.311439401122	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.487823794082	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.448557934678	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.161087027891	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.258771594985	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.647122555609	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.186388622969	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.672470855316	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.273326600609	It's a joke.
0.0	0.288892911624	I would change them.
0.0	0.445859573921	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.285088591095	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.389730444649	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.446375684272	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.453510223388	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.560091357838	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
1.0	0.568146709087	I didn't have an involvement with them.
1.0	0.613040018759	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.579115864676	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.124434951684	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.276796575706	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.331987478512	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.578496293293	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.743912540302	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.381360601939	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.681163277931	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.5	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.313429617365	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.456566806975	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.332468247966	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.296314633191	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.480289665562	That's fine.
0.0	0.274032831331	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.172348608547	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.155693689113	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.320085305821	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.383229022931	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.557049060627	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.221119298809	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
1.0	0.79648056976	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.419325488065	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.171108120192	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.490723790613	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.309557289231	Yes.
0.0	0.169566166933	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.20191924668	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.17809735354	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.313858087927	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.563775174854	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.473521646552	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.340168262311	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.0204870137409	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.374339449435	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.412153930963	Not bad.
0.0	0.393377526607	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.470727904411	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.386453730177	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.287455371947	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.189846578577	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.162206173624	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.130095818726	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.385472978154	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.391044328466	Right.
0.0	0.706594842984	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.404580480585	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.439205441554	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.52449201793	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.3702899154	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.362463971414	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.174804445725	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.430146322129	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.368326413432	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.312671857961	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.422047009196	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.203198074359	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.399915038662	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.513276894833	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.726760713162	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.100547351365	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.380917170833	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.0904116131191	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.482067850751	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.34305450579	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.170306131399	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.566125567025	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.186847693157	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.388257639443	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.774474841229	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.603868064847	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.364990580639	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.575512268179	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.468292652181	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.328639880804	I like that.
0.0	0.202457710961	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.210307316928	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.268916844065	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.363832549468	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.379508247984	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.34210691304	Think about it.
0.0	0.5	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.391044328466	Dynamically.
0.0	0.307623642004	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.555218999139	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.121752739125	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.119970290937	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.5	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.538566553992	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.518909272941	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.524309429202	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.429762869556	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.508091778892	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.414949931834	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.506430571512	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.354255802694	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.264269593689	He undermines it.
0.0	0.246681475734	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.398746902694	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.73962338058	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.376635545358	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.0898844198877	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.252361433638	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.201148567033	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.40669790023	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.249435235699	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.812937155329	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.359192738399	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.514628534706	Both served.
0.0	0.2482225936	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.54460049541	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.530243908615	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.581914013071	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.436036679377	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.410513242904	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.286289592444	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.296707498529	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.28525226629	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.51445282331	You have to lead.
0.0	0.613550745025	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.458670791699	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.5	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.404373505197	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.190329407138	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.261455132354	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.222543115543	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.684133845976	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.284526280415	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.283229555667	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.320117607737	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.807055930245	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.308153382362	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.278487860885	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.546026600268	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.337499038744	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.41751010252	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.249327292006	We're running.
0.0	0.907297565396	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.200248811525	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.397602999944	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.159650276337	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.543205041625	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.39223584506	I have.
0.0	0.457715373363	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.426440000205	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.922525922128	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.284338995224	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.191625755661	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.183278982828	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.380269210522	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.275374944848	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.334743387262	Again...
0.0	0.319707178329	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.280051951023	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.459473366101	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.475778133787	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.374536716079	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.254986592773	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.358351648754	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.562927449732	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.0372665374186	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.619792668599	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.427023175221	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.804591125359	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
1.0	0.953391018989	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.778551555227	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.176324138635	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.292499965927	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.281220330271	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.258769393839	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.331686387563	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.364849769939	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.549645160298	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.436630665943	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.250127203008	...
0.0	0.13770395546	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.217415031803	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.5	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.715505967178	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.477949929402	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.419443957632	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.389238322188	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.457789125721	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.339088840199	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.424322901966	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.209824645804	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.353828855303	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.18701500004	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.406176867146	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.43477912047	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.211231333917	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.330436085409	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.400857606532	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.148336296122	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.315707800951	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.132972210896	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.278519621814	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.868665703507	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.442582499044	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.387781564754	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.297866481011	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.450466927462	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.449052844056	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.418683758183	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.373828958679	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.267225694993	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.313460003061	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.554585141165	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.5	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.337761737265	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.212753536057	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.309557289231	OK.
0.0	0.200534612718	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.21091922642	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.533573932012	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.0816410985095	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.572939551075	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.748886570067	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.557584842605	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.268794144281	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.675903865253	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.578953717812	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.359754904385	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.375021514126	They don't like that.
0.0	0.732504555671	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.360172446318	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.924529877911	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.405254865669	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.309895423385	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.181437514731	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.254425230894	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.212556045943	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.378649143294	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.531610372988	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.398348915933	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.304628414653	Divide that out.
0.0	0.172250113397	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.530852996715	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.406389641054	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.556923614795	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.145466573442	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.486190080788	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.33471523109	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.518790169965	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.466232167234	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.315148149558	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.100087314537	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.457049169972	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.350452365835	Thank you.
0.0	0.560832890881	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.315685958312	I will not do that.
0.0	0.389638754605	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.203169228486	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.467227265001	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.449959469861	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.4662680594	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.467410973045	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.535615534808	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.549413874437	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.299020300395	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.25636891959	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.640719133486	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.487685336785	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.435606715908	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.368016096415	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.645516890021	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.472827410917	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.459695915702	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.445803482105	What have you got now?
0.0	0.423735566673	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.458747918078	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.490924870186	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.308525911346	That will change everything.
0.0	0.36237649751	No.
0.0	0.257445222347	You bet they do.
0.0	0.126576064813	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.254588885594	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.253300835796	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.37644046104	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.412193752705	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.470114585057	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.470419061926	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.287748320307	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.612593714659	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.330283586874	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.309557289231	Yeah.
0.0	0.278233741065	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.383987461717	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.6047159121	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.306804599038	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.637698199924	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.313119051176	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.88093066637	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.5	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.544311510738	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.654763259095	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.199236809775	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.464270296921	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.249271054431	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.414392733002	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.652664612647	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.339454449633	Our next president...
0.0	0.415993246115	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.212802850786	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.38071351422	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.433542866248	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.63467466634	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.390729943035	White people?
0.0	0.298622618016	OK, good.
0.0	0.389990481827	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.486554384844	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.450193347981	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.465400143491	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.462625453624	We actually did it.
0.0	0.274410268893	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.648793751577	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.551623370858	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.41406463022	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.328862593723	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.205632140759	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.367021616676	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.368153906042	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.413653435084	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.234966764014	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.469030416981	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.646778326928	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.476213130164	We had Hamas.
1.0	0.46775303227	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.452588990096	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.0820923981609	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.425932850123	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.226296112388	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.662408625827	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.245624599443	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.247438766826	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.197013968612	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.333896461231	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.66549127977	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.28730020982	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.329978799226	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.376123113564	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.350262231782	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.710372070774	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.575351879623	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.5	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
1.0	0.626596304699	Very few children.
0.0	0.382857434928	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.140765907581	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.390501137229	They're off to China.
0.0	0.640901646255	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.876489166568	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.509438680448	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.523125841624	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.398262002207	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.407940624539	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.365844048329	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.136547045266	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.378239306838	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.303700559712	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.412525839969	That's not right.
0.0	0.19137787261	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.288178855751	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.3004645183	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.309557289231	Yes.
0.0	0.678258362685	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.172972814404	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.723736149974	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.370260240138	I think he is right.
0.0	0.655283113392	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.280232368972	I think you're --
0.0	0.204654755992	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.380831495276	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.584673882906	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.715368492165	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.136035119494	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.462083413127	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.947352369224	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.734290275613	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.230172783438	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.385673684398	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.237826242513	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.459325095861	I understand.
0.0	0.426350744887	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.201469518044	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.266840232572	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.164850736127	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.270723769044	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.307416750165	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.382972965209	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.601013264505	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.350452365835	Thank you.
0.0	0.369470522701	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.380228825936	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.418228748274	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.194500764461	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.398275513435	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.719737207118	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.401333831098	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.607187040658	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.367941370855	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.4876411297	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.577391366023	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.564523807947	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.709293266352	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.248064770792	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.43952565467	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.429941403103	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.0683758320459	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.241088781419	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.350237593291	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.60428265446	So you know what?
0.0	0.234855770185	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.148112388863	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.353022788258	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
1.0	0.439692564788	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.366477281589	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.247816273121	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.536718103992	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.85644885821	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.275092287576	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.261075001138	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.304044272508	These...
0.0	0.311635324911	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.197097457862	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.303227560925	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.0937715532876	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.645328513319	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.713902237262	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.536982247908	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.455738298984	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.281234409151	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.231155272808	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.508091813707	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.216660060231	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.626072794524	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.478674254906	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.130123057372	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.350452365835	Thank you.
0.0	0.278619646609	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.646233547435	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.508964175004	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.473192607874	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.445712780515	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
1.0	0.533396078452	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.272977463261	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.336044820882	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
1.0	0.270598506417	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.363142798262	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.34148698324	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.267636145086	I don't care.
0.0	0.718521284036	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.664532282148	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.0690853413799	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.221353767447	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.553247389087	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.358168797241	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.378678902814	Say again?
0.0	0.17252305711	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.334848322098	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.297598993472	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.336743503802	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.525187567657	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.71989083254	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.181605804947	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.34242478635	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.589101501873	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.45960425691	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.323072355164	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.23349247195	I would just say that...
0.0	0.410440786138	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
1.0	0.434825823095	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.602161026284	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.585049236375	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.63513026989	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.454951322503	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
1.0	0.356228997596	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.364103316521	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.771670705178	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.4528548205	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.428760161246	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.43838229791	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.82189747217	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.160496427812	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.57878232055	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.383338616411	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.457285346915	I will show you what they do to women.
1.0	0.575727574858	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.578435242952	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.58683205696	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.645241489584	Of course not.
0.0	0.131049731181	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.485938439148	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.153099959626	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.287051866045	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.903120479677	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.464102246975	I changed that.
0.0	0.546027809646	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.289849765412	The answer is no.
0.0	0.657945112003	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.419298458395	I can't do it.
0.0	0.547939201873	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.248973421614	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.731050014527	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.841335083027	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.361242313204	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.375481849753	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.520622323243	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.217259559337	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
1.0	0.605402528333	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.606988858999	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.519842378132	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.670388523391	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.336247632748	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.388706368154	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.489437266489	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.680389416917	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.352270984692	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.725334032346	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.387811431349	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.507104243228	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.171473604521	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.468160601225	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.17950510226	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.0992822196667	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.187009446327	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.175087776799	-- the governor's absolutely right.
1.0	0.469269485986	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.206478825512	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.379066229092	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.476054522546	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.264770286731	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.39877418226	It's their money.
0.0	0.447594786347	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.24607513535	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.441530888717	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.69154031218	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.406744034497	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.450700827603	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.465389503196	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.181775967941	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.480729076188	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.43520335478	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
1.0	0.40195242159	That's wrong.
0.0	0.360007451117	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.350452365835	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.185568193471	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.409280347753	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.381705848287	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.0706895070679	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.354995380183	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.478209210301	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
1.0	0.475979660346	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
1.0	0.435609331304	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.250127203008	...
0.0	0.404486827493	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.667032785198	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.209864951657	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.87094854747	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.354957703152	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.823983079445	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.108926854258	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.309557289231	OK.
0.0	0.347427253799	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.567569643753	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.524223111755	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.430452322169	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.224065849519	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.706808210439	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.265945476739	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.191350163459	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.257160567435	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.205757091898	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.385823065042	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.451047009915	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.300553435168	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.0997892382655	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.338444326647	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.536329863375	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.226630576461	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.309867729855	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.385868723591	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.314315820793	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.39907017057	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.371920265986	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.595251594955	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.486765809496	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.512781289937	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.47053115839	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.453405332739	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.361716754473	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.631723417494	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.429102446195	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.284241897524	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.528237220861	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.480703372324	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.65363586764	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.329612705687	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.315295949117	Well, sure.
0.0	0.574437702577	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.428471672331	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.350452365835	Thank you.
0.0	0.438564963471	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.320203255191	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.520790740206	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.228212649846	I totally get that.
0.0	0.288655400863	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.366844502227	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.463477148494	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.335104603823	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.331495681234	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.367021616676	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.478102587456	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.395306054585	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.602093952073	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.474752649516	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.760149596832	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.23436080104	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.385355958092	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.803528989075	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.444692005623	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.336547626508	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.492524955379	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.100730243518	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.395905567901	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.483978730611	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.456733060973	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.232672888276	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.277704292408	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.534399294386	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.570412411028	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.32888184208	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.944734867719	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.374830830936	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.5	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.5	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.349260072377	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.220335156279	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.33615753883	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.632729199545	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.197367053725	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.306094783304	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.565771229477	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.21367496275	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.482213322844	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.234050836185	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.191048669351	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.645213129318	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
1.0	0.356033329275	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.548426789896	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.693856443571	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.774022296289	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.19415193997	You find me...
0.0	0.386404834606	John?

0.0	0.551543073717	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.309174879148	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.645937823892	It's called the value added tax.

0.0	0.354595322432	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.254501353178	I think we should do both.

0.0	0.431143163966	Well, I did.
0.0	0.398590758204	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.251829688679	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.53048219834	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.483575312346	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.445923733999	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.581964356232	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.

0.0	0.461945390651	Does he stand up for law enforcement?

0.0	0.388409331159	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.460629449699	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.436122231444	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.5	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.58763681034	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.28739328428	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.75417805127	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.243746326865	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.282632331858	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.263148343671	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.510180943762	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.387363756507	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.583412810844	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.248497521886	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.19854124392	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.395782801545	That's what he is.
0.0	0.667428600278	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.411425913124	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.244086606951	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.407256166672	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.473207973869	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.635667435951	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.360302929209	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.36237649751	No.
0.0	0.362803464278	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.471654388855	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.411284073229	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.275337297651	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.380683232509	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.513138733439	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.291142953937	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.30814581714	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.

0.0	0.549382232538	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.294340741795	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.477246540998	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.412685071642	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.5	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.091186710086	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.473288330714	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.382287525442	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.411105680274	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.142965049682	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.703828301901	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.300068998116	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.466391190421	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.234544225276	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.5	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.450337865702	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.570224920852	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.540169662276	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.378109013589	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.465195044284	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.

0.0	0.575798079107	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.180763591616	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.333935621503	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.

0.0	0.369056979107	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.304011367942	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.596343392126	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?

0.0	0.381895936458	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.521482442255	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.679841712259	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.639039990027	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.134141952913	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.66319749851	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.329477938123	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.274992326268	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.308964582504	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.647248667197	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.428042634336	It never happens.
0.0	0.332332756219	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.601942133428	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.532109904714	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.885273505288	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.580119178449	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.202199158389	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.882949996899	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.296518223903	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.57962143122	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.382883473885	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
1.0	0.485131197119	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.480289665562	That's fine.
0.0	0.233122848809	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.538871533052	He hit oil.
0.0	0.524610734622	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.620214036583	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.308734040698	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.852404926564	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.477566128029	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.434884776061	I never said that.
0.0	0.216843402819	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.550693401913	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.430064726832	We haven't.
0.0	0.546799739643	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.433517350798	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.198271777127	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.332802083958	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.199702232287	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.782681495205	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.31691229208	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.623689422354	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.712778006007	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.578517551548	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.333381087022	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.691937538194	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.322368654582	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.645707426817	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.360284866656	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.20918298632	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.695865678152	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.344583109946	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.439744819287	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.453865677236	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.0699951078393	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.428096026128	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.690571423931	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.341326065249	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.468516189446	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.60238673863	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.494957645736	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.300621845627	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.426352789739	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.301013758219	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.175865313345	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.576700445419	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.646155477627	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.293119893493	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.339464918494	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.407779844226	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.426604519839	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.341876360553	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.728106093233	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.267225909749	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.551428504784	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.467227265001	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.574562735284	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.295514693346	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.534747353455	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.389171576946	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.549172663377	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.54425727916	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.490201119513	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.464324139759	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.245121102928	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.207412647566	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.420798037977	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.152355113266	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.377496753408	About Medicare?
0.0	0.556726672708	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.554874014233	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.191164034652	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.838501134481	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.0142359329709	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.338254711052	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.479401595266	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.209261655883	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.250344805638	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.671350078351	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.101943848061	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.542006008747	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.387567498122	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.109090884191	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.493287865926	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.425818231873	A brief response.
0.0	0.288584205353	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.0928788353474	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.372437467093	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.223208760498	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.300894857904	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.645764122975	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.

0.0	0.399182539428	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.471200390354	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.267354636482	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.

0.0	0.305346291925	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.683320797423	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.249053778777	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.634916955085	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...

0.0	0.657418087082	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.78327903858	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.560437458736	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.23873202823	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.589360765237	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.632198919936	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
1.0	0.70884695293	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.479781820613	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.

0.0	0.26097487329	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.431295751655	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.903588086368	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.223043022032	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.27384019366	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.188818439623	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.

0.0	0.592893087694	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.

0.0	0.36237649751	No.
0.0	0.451144200822	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.431967173959	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.225228665594	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.155377043262	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.29644344117	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.458252712642	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.407295424642	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.367148563044	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.448815788262	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.374932021557	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.633531010385	You had two one hundred...
1.0	0.907575953125	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.

0.0	0.579056968943	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.461926210399	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.841062511312	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.350452365835	Thank you.
0.0	0.402073921441	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.236158400676	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.181339479139	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.535936736446	The world has changed.
0.0	0.702384007704	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.

0.0	0.588083112116	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.488117823162	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.528496798148	Two points.
0.0	0.335780874135	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.174615353935	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.522507659267	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.182943448141	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.366274540977	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.667350676592	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.

0.0	0.552856255564	Just for the record.
0.0	0.459639847463	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.241685530356	So what if mass unemployment exists?

0.0	0.250127203008	...
0.0	0.338409627706	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.232201344474	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.735149750741	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.582210180202	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.270500531993	I want to reverse that decline.

0.0	0.507820291666	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.537623405916	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.292821036533	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.304973194645	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.667739246717	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.310569706735	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.659984186901	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.614864070854	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.346779606853	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.41401792432	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.164828392494	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.475074815383	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.339807397488	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.233084728096	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.410506599417	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.555514438787	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.283144785218	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.5	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.192455164324	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.538583738873	We don't win.
1.0	0.601907165814	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.578163013384	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.226121868615	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.342484674574	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.391128748104	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.201083921961	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.454856544082	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.562843428291	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.243101423618	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
1.0	0.632754879472	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.141244008282	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.268026162131	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.302404133583	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.435496707316	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.218656406121	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.456570982711	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.399327538833	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.336865312984	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.781463123955	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.593812387174	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.355619322488	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.0617411308393	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.317281187807	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.309557289231	OK?
0.0	0.357570579354	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.679343996813	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.546663304649	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.473999280784	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.482806706958	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.5	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.

0.0	0.727931176411	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.643529535378	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.153874211449	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.256135894493	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.30756438294	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.459755984981	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.675950789361	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.

0.0	0.395487492168	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.429741750674	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.38927384381	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.511942847949	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.997397555064	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.181299099566	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.335550281553	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.131929419773	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.254385757787	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.573464340959	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.46610479288	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.509653888129	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.428703030652	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.172271823652	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.334743387262	So...
0.0	0.637627396029	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.244287365156	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.390431388069	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.359597150661	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.550306408426	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
1.0	0.386419468188	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.538173621884	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.471892590029	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.489111842475	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.267400259881	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.462547748715	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.146993168676	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.409680988685	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.408468131269	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.421124833035	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.224625318903	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.516418467494	We'll go to the Congress.

0.0	0.265479503264	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.525166245305	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.516364285884	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.

0.0	0.135923866757	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.433992293611	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.452136603384	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.263273539219	You count on it.
0.0	0.355000716413	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
1.0	0.766684588733	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.156066252709	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.450632056446	That's my bill.
0.0	0.322379406328	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.588478421639	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
1.0	0.773506886328	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.381918254226	Let me just -- let me respond.

0.0	0.357284170485	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.362061472261	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.

0.0	0.54167428538	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.256529627062	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.402034439462	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.655380769586	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.310687331169	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.594953174526	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.92156558723	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.309557289231	Yeah.
0.0	0.36237649751	No.
0.0	0.335319500542	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.34429645197	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.350452365835	Thank you.
0.0	0.0726402560027	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.316925483508	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.565542996966	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.753341799115	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.427108929903	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.542459643814	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.669307604003	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.248805265457	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.546952871685	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.407194189964	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.479401595266	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.509950241032	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.593904503434	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.430064726832	You're right.
0.0	0.541283851046	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.402272423623	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.520884056611	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.441272005512	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.340447813299	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.681835243375	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.202148992179	Came out great.
0.0	0.379976155135	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.268927397868	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.296265053966	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.47181504329	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
1.0	0.330017462803	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.102247197362	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.913207899564	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.858450920062	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.445068379719	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.222623828679	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.323502093811	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.212164586701	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.32258251764	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.651155807282	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.438784932187	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.423055948305	I got that.
0.0	0.462384191133	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.35825684094	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.301815635105	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.669276742888	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.297783149216	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.804673975326	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.535665346209	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.563792559104	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.343675223407	See?
0.0	0.244666043624	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.33149058922	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.309557289231	OK?
0.0	0.202878859301	And here's why.
0.0	0.309146136855	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.449465570382	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.5	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.0567703556061	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.341971968647	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.562401834751	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.43874850801	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.319854292192	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.400290013011	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
1.0	0.804366675823	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.606086174731	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.233849292475	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.235613999955	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.386404834606	Alright.
0.0	0.346303670626	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.350452365835	Thank you.
0.0	0.564917949698	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.0425771858537	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.405376412206	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.766276910931	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.423332550111	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.109661569404	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.401151261203	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.669619871309	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
1.0	0.584362036091	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.717858930083	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.561665556545	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.328308123277	We need sound money.
0.0	0.346019637232	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.5	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.34210691304	Think about it.
0.0	0.476448398075	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.375021514126	I don't like that.
0.0	0.23838094472	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.418589281787	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.87865291362	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.330560998522	Becky --
0.0	0.242675921236	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.543416233556	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.393575728757	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.176910010686	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.439035882628	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.179869979369	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
1.0	0.506203074872	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.0702422666188	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.17439301402	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.430141284177	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.579633497871	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.392744231625	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.239320527078	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.452726566084	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.258263943541	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.171110175119	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.101260529712	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.340729710318	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
1.0	0.602151209802	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.162961939912	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.47740416687	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.627970201333	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.328867674998	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.398362546412	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.572496956095	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.424471591508	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.430064726832	You're right.
0.0	0.259351240002	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.458538603374	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.469545308667	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.582362223492	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.397999884861	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.44756324357	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.309557289231	Yes.
0.0	0.328022267671	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.566950936311	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.386147951616	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.261568902133	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.309972747879	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.350452365835	Thank you.
0.0	0.217285357242	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.303504792035	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.473557208145	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.449053153896	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.33843563057	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.430973210155	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.695830952183	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.293990531801	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.171987068966	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.350452365835	Thank you.
0.0	0.595586222472	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.522175484175	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.394285167803	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.684478331486	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.43871010381	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.761133827103	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
1.0	0.853755719353	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.311122299045	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.136583304709	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.

0.0	0.168017618203	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.186101857537	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.319684477386	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.396936293059	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.322392762898	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.315242638927	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.606900839598	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.545707913283	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.435645173866	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.418845221349	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.123262995933	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.522816877882	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.751897659175	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.428794667651	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.432261925966	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.280578421314	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.253658617987	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.543056520611	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.308445783657	Why is that?
0.0	0.377648135666	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.401011791603	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.250127203008	...
0.0	0.362923408429	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.228851819375	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.523378565021	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.386016781852	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.394581702511	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.37535194022	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.370128025769	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.161137887214	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.87127598436	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.551086114825	And you know what?
0.0	0.368973244078	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.282442333482	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.552563092579	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.466927394522	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.220501603641	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.890941997545	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.372535821119	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.0932523801213	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.174353912492	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.254184501477	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.282557806753	How great is that?
0.0	0.600454176049	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.343202577067	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.320698263391	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
1.0	0.719116971136	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.541838339029	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.731932136663	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.345349575678	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.43503426042	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.305566822105	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.439192567798	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.300218932933	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.397116398645	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.424521796416	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.437378830065	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.233451222171	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.265663201601	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.354993806002	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.0849427759155	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.244181768625	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.454725441072	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.596282668551	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.479079836024	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.254815049983	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.516540197267	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.475245290296	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.256696382826	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.184329017246	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.358349765307	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.528641294315	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.460763889895	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.630870447597	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.450551516105	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.508393508979	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.680756890717	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.278605710533	It's not working.
0.0	0.268488807738	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.519032858666	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.417252549688	You know why three?
0.0	0.462015008688	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.576971395472	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.366687089954	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.295912442358	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.526483962698	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.711553470876	We need to reform Social Security.
1.0	0.459254155456	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.490482734944	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.350720433112	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.399820170633	He does great.
0.0	0.212089610877	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.488970383105	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.566070483657	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.438362163406	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.230287441858	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.404580480585	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.384969349879	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.482507002934	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1.0	0.489351359438	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.419561798916	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.512604385399	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.512796365182	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
1.0	0.491604709989	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.362286024991	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.322380369317	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
1.0	0.772379316374	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.592107549457	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.633385208043	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.334831201131	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.249052153269	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.40925891666	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.0512716034819	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.296086479405	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.441231860833	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.388257484458	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.186688373218	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.12716983891	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.706786653371	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.420586101559	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.190145792882	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.5	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.341100089677	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.904026580618	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.300561128467	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.252432405148	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.251860336207	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.176012924076	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.377655612516	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.388176866446	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.471597333154	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.357326511504	Let's talk about our campaigns.
1.0	0.274245170153	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.313739014323	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.595378718877	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.359359099656	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.631993799185	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.594473242743	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.263677139832	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.446023558739	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.441139075141	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.209404899487	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.559753293479	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.5	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.404352993213	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.481224091935	She was right.
0.0	0.328047867897	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.388333546575	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.537054521912	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.5	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.447819589967	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.329209645416	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.160311370097	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.520939486558	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.610339905933	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
1.0	0.334473830314	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.334344820765	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.159746745239	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.296652844228	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.335818586364	I have...
0.0	0.204239027826	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.412556018668	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.525375600006	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.412147479413	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.443256393557	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.610825912318	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.346474680717	You know why?
0.0	0.393749601731	And we are not England.
0.0	0.299249884847	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.247547621894	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.621924330414	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.457843740666	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.343186220235	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.470157447163	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.210668444356	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.579802329593	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.281496798242	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.490390611715	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.305413223144	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.195873497679	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.209489850313	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.360053603596	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.284366344707	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.472425762915	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.773152011543	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.514375873936	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.570532116294	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.714435531942	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.800985142665	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.24124942994	And why?
0.0	0.301958478855	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.520771001718	You're simply not.
0.0	0.541682257711	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.261315438211	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.519207566806	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.318963987025	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.565139975199	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.278875046961	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.459723880167	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
1.0	0.489519951305	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.232994783325	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.196196972178	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.564335526946	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.371113232713	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.638392848315	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.35305492487	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.31188666764	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.303066153788	I will do that in Washington.
1.0	0.595486790209	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.41838713686	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.459245506663	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.385181446876	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.349794307895	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.127065862482	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.596064694493	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.272066286143	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.358726601655	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.418244248709	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.330446698806	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.548234901354	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.106783956936	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.40615145194	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.395624937206	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.614613511662	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.558414970393	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.278198143873	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.0502610680336	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.335075392853	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.52474980551	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.400908367698	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.69508746905	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.405634547246	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.28238974255	I'll say this.
0.0	0.200119477712	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.450072516947	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.613000338737	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.374282234312	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.603046151559	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.573225980722	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.565451860922	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.376131420742	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.289220240049	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.444760890602	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.331952608873	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
1.0	0.696196007624	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.275938511127	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.64475754325	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.16239451579	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.222650690038	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.543651359571	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.639770321842	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.561305824876	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.333491124301	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.199731625958	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.530894778524	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.129362825992	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
1.0	0.270842974522	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.288154803901	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.53496730223	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.33454541885	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.416976491698	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.423774316602	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.542588227134	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.733206182434	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.456921184748	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.0836422266319	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.473397819281	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.7171115608	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.248771962809	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.348599038306	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.275703086538	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.278382267531	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.229632454312	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.53169823809	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.517898520174	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.456900474832	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.206832494632	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.413524858366	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.254403331421	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.305312695973	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.548807950788	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.446787510346	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.591821384529	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.5	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.429256700413	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.239418441598	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.43967598211	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.665081242121	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.386531748987	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.3689789473	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.419396876743	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.5	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.433622868643	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.43564592905	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.532857369293	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.585682785373	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.465527972635	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.555682749254	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.36237649751	No.
0.0	0.381433588405	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.645862094372	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.4426167576	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.522498345343	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.400808969868	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.428803246922	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.522248440057	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.30480339577	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.479079836024	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.488370061552	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.311711314753	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.475627322464	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.143237305852	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.458661060332	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.467968492167	See, here's the thing.
1.0	0.519580989138	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.551086114825	And you know what?
0.0	0.621786983728	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.299580344135	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.263974805154	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.369070932453	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.350452365835	Thank you.
0.0	0.27902437112	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.398975956468	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.454678643403	Now, you've got Europe.
1.0	0.610850626833	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.291571865716	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.374114277959	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.524665971137	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.5	That's what I said.
0.0	0.392646344688	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.247098801929	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.568339726593	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.885585985499	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.373894544493	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.402583977643	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.133706579535	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.533607273701	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.402259526837	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.508978336347	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.179721599968	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.391721130706	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.60742032309	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.527763918786	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.438667014431	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.482746335309	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.346850988727	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.287167933704	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.267317146468	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.338956688107	I was the architect.
0.0	0.298498107337	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.118291476811	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.8372044955	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.197561128967	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.165401185882	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.430781733317	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.550190768188	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.410932289178	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.47197657076	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.396361202586	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.198143205468	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.313223501592	...Chris...
1.0	0.913075122524	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.467810464056	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.409093518743	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.295496570353	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.253189258228	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.426181508519	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.456026002035	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.370472590375	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.480579471764	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.356550096443	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.58883462373	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.147075887653	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.359308679398	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.580894303962	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.471327978114	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.416817852308	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.715438408325	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.475136704149	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.315934047793	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.591196586414	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.315523492462	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.528093182928	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.0974089888496	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.137996366124	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.19566435344	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.426272781577	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.480427475253	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.276693167953	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.321939981052	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.461512588264	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.0566727304459	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
