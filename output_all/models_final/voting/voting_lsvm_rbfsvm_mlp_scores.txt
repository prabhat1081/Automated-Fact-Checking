0.0	0.467295934076	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.238373460637	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.213628549513	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.257695170724	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.219786985568	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.654274554263	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.165473419764	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.

0.0	0.455194731675	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.173210144298	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.513438450244	You don't have to.

0.0	0.570886540799	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.069872371916	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.395327900125	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.395511312936	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.371593536233	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.869091507177	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.208031273974	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.360628241603	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.251739251603	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.277643889187	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.240376129989	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.274086975841	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.75166490331	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.575621676563	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.406072026728	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.

0.0	0.693440164074	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.341359466566	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.513241458213	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.114188495825	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.162405049935	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
1.0	0.862970950682	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.652875798906	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.677489254018	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.248560150116	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.110269832795	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.22476665428	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.869592392014	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.243843812173	That's not true.
0.0	0.133574855648	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.773367657429	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.190396667731	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.175397884109	That's what we need.
0.0	0.511002623366	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.576345695547	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.220247691992	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.251801394037	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.182642019541	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.349750352255	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.491831945173	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.653726096433	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.588136504563	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.178426989368	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.462354229689	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.398207192605	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.27069069401	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.203764132555	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.137079369706	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
1.0	0.772435704618	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.439258236339	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.107676454953	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.0929005687038	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.250042415182	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.226315532922	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.343967720623	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.100739576707	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.202539665511	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.523201264576	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.78898888853	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.847118972036	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.752455933433	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.195216419687	...income tax...
0.0	0.577464147382	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.142533589738	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.745733305154	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.830368728064	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.472094099604	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.305361222695	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.732500633996	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.216375008172	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.150373264178	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.24497055093	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.178540792889	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.706032716631	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.307496450184	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.382787627065	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.35243333489	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.214911040737	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.852273826864	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.747118117504	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.629366056038	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.382452261756	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.317766307317	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.118575046326	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.104186373949	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.132001008602	...Chris...
0.0	0.655777146707	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.259700432489	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.473464067052	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.792980844953	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
1.0	0.622333600498	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.199328201646	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.128354306379	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.246244775109	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.655799556133	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.632809444162	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.200240542304	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.11300862722	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.872932247758	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.843874385097	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.143388423498	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.154117495382	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.252050598317	That is not right.
0.0	0.703848841194	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.644796668664	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.582252013255	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.311547780408	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.162771001357	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.753375765516	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.311259145386	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.415579824573	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.573413160975	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.760843178281	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.527229280264	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.223645615024	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.282647950478	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.729795385131	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.347315752264	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.257501194029	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.151846048488	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.190972250025	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.351086087247	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.342475611031	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.925514220587	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.342301592747	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.264015960568	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.0914364553082	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.521247651797	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.559601074195	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
1.0	0.346267008086	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.713238464041	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.240186890489	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.795243111828	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.566427096724	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.471711162657	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.349375350097	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.364168671521	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.8147647034	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.

0.0	0.149427206201	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.320648923998	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.721417654228	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.186621016245	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.283834699462	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.

0.0	0.207902081489	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.0556867056671	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.243802986304	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.629319813763	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.0451766439759	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.

0.0	0.301127007128	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.257646355072	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.164008098908	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.18612634235	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.154510797212	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.204777832758	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.548482814586	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.241605980224	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.566397700416	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.187219272934	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.0851115101055	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.576061615041	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.201020915928	The economy was really booming.
1.0	0.759926956783	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.172206615951	Yeah.
0.0	0.233814546819	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.313722241484	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.200023051584	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.249737152911	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.192603000972	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.510653362216	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.159721116134	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.649149290593	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.271963286209	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.863725328639	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.267188155614	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.11133287324	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.18131304472	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.302595529402	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.843954168072	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.383042804483	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.188912789484	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.129048124064	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.375162100428	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.32448842468	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.149103579724	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.16234514668	Our next president...
0.0	0.767696878846	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.195697356508	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.164783051873	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.123710211995	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
1.0	0.514313475439	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.220708910173	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.686633116603	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.185631574157	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.681531622981	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.32773884665	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.777896231734	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.0372379410906	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.235906593236	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.611344098972	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.195347033944	Thank you.
0.0	0.1624135133	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.697039015198	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.406082612424	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.104655080564	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.249642970857	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.198853806363	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.220233990888	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.219654869689	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.0956577800449	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.415277956698	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.331526708875	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.0547848246769	But also, I can't fake anger.
1.0	0.690032974774	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
1.0	0.532700799041	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.135642741481	It's not the evil rich people.
1.0	0.712274240402	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.281076674728	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.266345328553	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.588212896448	I'm ready.
0.0	0.136160552614	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.135511048015	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.376748312496	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.694243729752	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.332321576409	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.678145598496	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.0794281868164	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.19965772738	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.208878087464	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.171843222836	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.209417469333	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.612743334813	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.265108411916	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.263459555943	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.203670075916	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.125202379914	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.560437059862	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.220679016341	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.673133880628	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.145050034361	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.416600598083	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.651340864239	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.664379473272	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
1.0	0.862051589348	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.0824361998571	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.62625882247	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.430698521864	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
1.0	0.610485977748	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.224505824336	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.183774327812	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.181514928581	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.654864999888	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.2346298418	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.885616262456	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.208297163806	You know that.
0.0	0.256143802138	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.270359967796	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.272633417177	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.201188068238	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.756869553065	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.250037768643	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.397776952581	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.511667775092	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.298589478163	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.168364124738	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.246147964795	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.509711062127	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.296259326899	Both served.
0.0	0.402543341435	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.312717200483	That's what I said.
0.0	0.610943530723	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.195260103197	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.627223540043	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.342098151253	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.246513373135	A brief response.
0.0	0.105038741295	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.0917514041486	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.691991112109	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.123137935362	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.170031790526	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.585294621983	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.696795731655	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.481503342867	He has never defended...
0.0	0.232817934983	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.223726751933	John.
0.0	0.0846452864665	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.118271086792	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.627837623477	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.432425167092	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.203635289027	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.490935018941	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.756463476338	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.0817365663604	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.712882525482	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.250591912304	It never happens.
0.0	0.641139067362	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.217879780206	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.513824882946	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.249220852478	I've done it.
0.0	0.275172034824	I would change them.
0.0	0.189600593974	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.592003134959	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.41177041265	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.695031719979	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.258345171365	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.190186370164	Came out great.
1.0	0.593272316843	I was not at all critical of him.
1.0	0.303392201547	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.108444521271	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.295459311994	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.0929975722192	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.213339115448	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.19088352076	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.13212233307	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.448289078695	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.741493467596	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.717104934196	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.429780735305	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.536104987168	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.271298754178	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.730856166137	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.116212331539	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.286762077014	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.598136704615	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.174932775628	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.339674078176	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.339136141389	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.237705586682	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.589709196322	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.764319632657	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.184609556441	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.20089641168	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.705061406234	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.432186975931	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.640827775728	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.457550123388	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.131739741064	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.581785126832	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.151511095754	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.297009017174	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.830099070327	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.694933455154	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.153823673925	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.205715732836	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.101768024823	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.480344590846	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.259644097797	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.214454589159	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.640987334435	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.395370449221	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.

0.0	0.134656742701	He undermines it.
0.0	0.162550097034	So we have a disagreement on this.

0.0	0.0958500628355	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.488273438649	That's not the America that I've ever known.

0.0	0.209854398271	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.674921432367	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.540653374765	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.473047947244	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.846105609352	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.713178034617	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.280918245499	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.148291375911	And, I'll do that with the country.

0.0	0.37365407675	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.731666602843	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.243016459726	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.773083574207	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.646703445194	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.599619825275	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.111215855833	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.707775689571	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.792596697839	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.253774285112	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.542685387767	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.357961353804	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.199646328618	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.165554834313	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.626059619399	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.0943393258583	We just want to be the rich."

0.0	0.175067918098	I don't care.
0.0	0.71425251654	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.168208062249	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.0344693321968	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...

0.0	0.195347033944	Thank you.
0.0	0.11300719757	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.0236504286597	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.154471671633	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.194447909329	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.888646031014	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.21337259457	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.126750639962	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.0616410243537	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.627695304819	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.124331304555	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.257336770013	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.332542054136	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.163350736509	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.375544667476	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.0815251279055	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.73238805587	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.20826279493	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.859923342555	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.600315566195	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.59013234363	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.894769444065	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.269102149774	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.626968013858	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.302245047422	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.393991525311	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.619653645511	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.6904333213	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.428367846076	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.687711413448	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.127250405682	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.233166612692	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.572689176833	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.237041406205	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.815633653009	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.373287094245	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.351597160659	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
1.0	0.657784740511	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.672848526108	He hit oil.
0.0	0.685832281544	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.0782685793004	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.271429213226	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.145930193028	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.698194937353	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.214466283862	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.743735110595	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.733714057028	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
1.0	0.940017902624	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.0909578763005	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.562250749962	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.248154579703	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.825074309609	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.610262746302	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.364258049939	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.117477798287	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.394725961234	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.350162258695	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.252782089145	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.156093615766	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.446527170563	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.

0.0	0.133144271445	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.224231284638	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.213256846292	Can we stop?
0.0	0.489519355263	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.617252294516	They're off to China.
0.0	0.130563329225	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.726241875678	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.

0.0	0.224806001926	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.217717983323	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.62017172093	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.552984824744	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.25720366907	Just for the record.
0.0	0.439229654687	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.

0.0	0.867919477932	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.64234670759	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.

1.0	0.398986650608	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.813156254937	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.156627893321	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.588403267255	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.

0.0	0.0988309109288	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.251957686848	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.815172667467	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.0628345552259	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0744558079123	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.790564163712	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.638055975927	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.529951012045	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.145052448336	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.412102947357	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.206349031101	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.35061629623	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.770547889251	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.239239202556	We have Dodd-Frank.
1.0	0.884811751883	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.592837755537	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.781158402236	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.322849702969	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.58515440666	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.54954890695	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.392698963288	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.168418413427	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.36944884963	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.2301800696	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.188845066049	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.721842245517	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.267948872673	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.122724295802	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.626304514477	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
1.0	0.976952579882	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.087432407151	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.297100642274	I promise.
0.0	0.833555797087	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.215896703838	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.189708893742	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.436515473528	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.286664576674	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.0929226603351	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.410430787637	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.181328322042	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.739837080398	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.130262635142	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.585294621983	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.543184509336	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.248268989658	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.118105298615	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.143516663081	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.119501758128	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.23308428466	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.164102187814	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.739229275056	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.536268937999	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.274705798604	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.473204770277	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.668524365457	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.634219004002	The world has changed.
0.0	0.614095052745	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.270004184671	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.193270404324	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.183994837973	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.227680406504	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.384112508229	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.220183904357	Right.
0.0	0.816627870331	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.857246333498	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.304350623391	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.190850806246	No their not.
0.0	0.888980816467	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.0850704036943	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.150333432751	...
0.0	0.726560751103	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.174476607088	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.671825307211	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.829846961727	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.60292893898	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.477819711937	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.707867142832	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.172989984028	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.281123229409	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.686127100419	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.21115692813	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.662028542562	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.737976164948	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.876789747359	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.210619699011	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.

0.0	0.172347627818	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.150659535382	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.638236248978	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.239986892745	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.0626832618963	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.164366716495	We can't do it.
0.0	0.718946265236	He was on the board.
0.0	0.208500186739	Illegal.
0.0	0.106331408969	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.4627516817	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.131070726919	The number of women --
0.0	0.471161158732	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.274190274088	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.649270889884	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.563861338766	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.286998546809	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.374416090137	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.455116330236	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.278660061301	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.142653336247	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.219285362893	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.23375384028	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.47029249233	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.836831144554	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.

0.0	0.142943670534	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.335932005989	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.

1.0	0.332587667942	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.690724514687	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.

0.0	0.209766690633	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.

0.0	0.0632016478188	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.243673455526	I agree with them.
0.0	0.706564153817	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.

0.0	0.619980476612	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.155509158417	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.179879173297	And I have many great Muslim friends.

0.0	0.573298393676	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
1.0	0.869705091093	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.756960197708	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.216980006338	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.494276756201	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.320573254099	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.37420986366	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.211190000616	We have no borders.
0.0	0.430658605793	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.610159664696	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.108545649041	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.202057502733	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.275517559385	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.648691157118	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.262353451212	That never works.
0.0	0.645645479032	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.656638152702	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.200495008846	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.538415533773	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.218984728716	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.164486618591	And so do I.
0.0	0.286955954598	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.659015859489	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.589342605158	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.195347033944	Thank you.
0.0	0.268792336399	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.668511696905	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.0628345552259	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.439443899883	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.285338968826	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.184227573485	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.224685839965	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.182019169778	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.401713367054	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.658280062817	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.546255422593	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.338809508505	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.326693453665	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.184647641921	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.274805950788	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.184342365467	I've laid out...
0.0	0.174574229658	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.48471969605	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.249504499567	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.106602288647	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.703842833851	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.569227381544	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.19150662424	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.256757273326	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.162690577388	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.722887302309	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.552136677851	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.49383424599	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.317604544294	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.169335473401	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.615790011857	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.198221178914	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.46386728868	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.335038681744	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.167604143882	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.368992587417	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.38025965963	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.29317011758	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.158321175395	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.760369098663	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.257063612348	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.47951434448	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.310563645154	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.657012417408	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.850815797765	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.299345478079	We have Arab allies.

0.0	0.291211682906	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.418186527273	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.492965292151	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.173210144298	Well, thank you very much.

0.0	0.440800013638	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.642316378657	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.347564449842	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.

0.0	0.18607641657	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.762967909626	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.387834466218	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.397643558022	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.327155038079	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.670418544178	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.

0.0	0.161008811927	That is...
0.0	0.154395784879	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
1.0	0.609127018264	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.0612017209369	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.613260598023	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.141415262501	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
1.0	0.506253885671	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...

0.0	0.733769036324	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.252829674056	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.671485835292	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.191261757537	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.349326075188	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.637875643519	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.468982784571	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.81273950564	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.

0.0	0.342677687666	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.782930216218	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.12023045249	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.173498351441	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.161860706465	It works very, very well.
1.0	0.312020548224	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.27979965003	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.642839698284	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.202560659504	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.533967082857	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.

0.0	0.208063720212	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.635810836716	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.138248985329	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.679476365355	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.223923764767	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.674748436984	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.153806361918	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.371109260056	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.182482682128	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.548327027624	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.361050100222	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.709482415872	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.129795174915	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.635931638833	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.143999369984	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.209427053661	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.0733884714869	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.648197331802	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.804931931492	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.465142698591	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.137344378244	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.186132722804	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.65048583724	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.207005894269	Divide that out.
0.0	0.581988185384	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.550684091575	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.295946719659	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.801887121559	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.146950047253	We're running.
0.0	0.0901653803691	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.684894564168	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.590283425881	I never said that.
0.0	0.172206615951	Yes.
0.0	0.213475922418	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.234820783498	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.434533761191	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.556888204573	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.197079321224	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.234200726177	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.355594523093	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.751282842495	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.844281449861	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.167633779507	I want security.
0.0	0.365696468007	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.341059691426	Government is the enemy.
1.0	0.876615582189	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.142415132048	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.235869600263	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.271650502459	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.23361730171	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.763481330169	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.670285892623	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.419445443264	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.221693471603	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.25623592465	This will end.
0.0	0.250591912304	It goes away.
0.0	0.545487188831	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.197403767545	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.0990741485943	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.189708893742	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.606601120529	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.236712352021	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.141680872554	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.275476557944	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.252043949994	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.201668785253	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.517464767894	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.0983075751112	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.567353577337	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.833340875328	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.0902733840702	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.12198174344	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.266612343675	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.776965960381	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.613359241976	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.211138557392	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.489152531951	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.716874267277	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.578674576908	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.59035750916	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.0405467583258	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.308485956782	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.264964163601	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.331432088626	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.460738453138	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.795992194338	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.141813557876	That's my view.
0.0	0.653250817687	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.644823295367	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.623454584436	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.160017671504	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.400242526002	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.197268674073	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.163403077912	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.511803577958	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.202108080831	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.250576551701	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.706321528782	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.280266920514	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.328434922063	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.799549134536	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
1.0	0.75719780703	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.187280453888	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.500317887123	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.386834489785	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.163016673284	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.784630056869	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.0903010417128	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
1.0	0.675643688414	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.234288761584	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.946909054049	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.277128737916	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.204744570672	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.179173459467	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.609271635933	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.153093371564	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.219739501321	Not bad.
0.0	0.620295178662	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.320556549876	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.580788478638	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.216299994256	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.812084723152	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.299009953134	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.353235276333	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.363098241541	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.639386807836	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.224206211798	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.190546289835	You know why?
0.0	0.162359582399	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.17753873156	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.441416186748	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.714801267682	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.175381813642	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.33469514141	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.338629754476	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.769787318853	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.172206615951	OK?
0.0	0.651192653505	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.319553266046	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.107498126379	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.425368267065	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.491866797499	You count on it.
0.0	0.175098485382	How great is that?
0.0	0.236829540581	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.236299365719	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.286648012414	This is 2016.
0.0	0.291170232181	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.68837842965	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.657068960534	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.0447830347416	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.

0.0	0.290244628422	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.983078042212	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.668545707378	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.748440944328	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
1.0	0.677687849936	They stole it.
0.0	0.256295553874	I got that.
0.0	0.135981278672	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.

0.0	0.19748371263	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.298678206214	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.411102385455	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.195347033944	Thank you.
0.0	0.20732599846	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.109894779107	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.17221567754	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.277434543381	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.186729473985	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
1.0	0.271000686611	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.755659122996	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.248623485122	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.740960244302	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.122702304897	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.437304393711	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
1.0	0.297618459258	Very few children.
0.0	0.172076900148	It's not working.
0.0	0.636351641777	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.594283069477	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.786683468565	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.478098768008	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.184797624893	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.204734791084	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.212879127394	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.310512329539	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.538656543647	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.339060985347	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.0809002645415	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.532660903042	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.424816341814	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.0742299990947	And guess what?
0.0	0.740447541623	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.207611073539	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.649328564791	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.462334869129	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.284612779055	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.154351747524	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.351738853386	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.197466453702	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.27719823191	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.443427493844	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.18797183862	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.24612871971	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.290356303794	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.16683064173	...Thank you.
0.0	0.68262813409	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.418015219256	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.523361879686	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.539795457638	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.23027805615	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.652585537527	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.666978753248	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.539782203389	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.176679703337	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.666362393117	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.338871888591	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.136786986799	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.150333432751	...
0.0	0.35627157548	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.286099020155	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.544705643203	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.266329865468	We're running.
0.0	0.248254392751	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.359058023111	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.454386539493	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.383702990772	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.203901479431	And, we said no.
0.0	0.225005948187	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.435695705883	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.320568786046	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.264088694635	Well, I did.
0.0	0.746636778899	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.279020613278	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.770402200586	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.802380011178	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.370091617657	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.209499720222	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.167316509975	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.222978119404	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.627615898333	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.84611852007	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.654674386854	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.164366716495	I can't do it.
0.0	0.273156872015	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.117099076111	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
1.0	0.875257514492	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.324887937286	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.119908987673	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.195577118069	You're welcome.
0.0	0.154007049998	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.311953720825	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.767167673024	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.657939472554	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.329423391768	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.187538288419	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.1735013899	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.52277060351	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.481085408582	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.246240162509	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.0941060626629	And, the only way -- no...
1.0	0.6238333532	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.360176559313	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.197133465806	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.486985272229	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.592000435202	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.726139474242	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
1.0	0.332495147048	That's wrong.
0.0	0.814462186935	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.0965218936785	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.328720122274	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.803911856663	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.194050366966	You looking at me?
0.0	0.322943598576	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.550851944332	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.753421690264	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.236282458308	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.615375794616	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
1.0	0.833540205374	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.223838488182	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.268587321776	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.564542144742	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.759457494368	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.396446092135	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.381220744939	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.169330392737	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.197399459433	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.697284387427	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.165132786266	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.481592671712	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.641419869212	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.442728844345	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
1.0	0.256840753498	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.14485603846	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.710034757767	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.187651814896	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.929178003658	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.353911749352	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.552811559783	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.21677451933	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.375365325781	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.223709506904	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.178814289417	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.283567117915	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.902154637142	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.601337115373	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.378599425791	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.604339822014	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.0948322360721	And I want to make this our government.
1.0	0.770665329291	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.177657291942	I think he is right.
0.0	0.52417166152	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
1.0	0.346555643566	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.632143448881	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.146030921942	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.0861941924209	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.104670561495	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.712606382134	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.193631622658	See?
0.0	0.282847421533	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.651193275277	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.838119655124	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.234579347452	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.239354099175	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.0604181217691	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.280425322459	That's the difference.
1.0	0.340705198404	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
1.0	0.546435223861	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.0784206813846	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.164105504269	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.355446340827	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.516226427445	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.170874251787	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.290325356877	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.124274068298	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.565645807576	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.599825471772	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.635406754449	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.253184524513	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.5287199087	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
1.0	0.550088453261	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.652837226957	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.195442709433	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.172206615951	OK?
0.0	0.0841530839047	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.228357853502	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.614871293618	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.866325975026	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.

0.0	0.203907043533	No.

0.0	0.0826654678158	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.675477100481	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.250231690184	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.392673942183	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.70598886776	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.35832211626	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.182243164666	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.596244820556	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.608187022305	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.639794435934	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.411277076491	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.764033286292	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.765332679491	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.135456846341	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.257246006657	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.209000858039	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
1.0	0.885944107958	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.327697430426	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.772328431578	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.281484070215	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.245386639797	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.0883116285926	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.605851414765	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.244399642984	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.857234545009	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.

0.0	0.247706754168	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.253964433491	And what we want to do is to control this.

0.0	0.680903803625	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.187747809267	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.152299131577	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.38081601945	Credibility counts.

0.0	0.340706312376	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.145703188915	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.629450622109	Gronkowski is still going strong.

0.0	0.259307372082	That's my bill.
0.0	0.540534704206	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.186191968803	In addition to that...
0.0	0.22573993836	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.250359572514	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.6632261302	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.690876447134	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.268442003818	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.261409363782	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.509536399388	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.260316580472	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.207427356936	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.188049590202	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.281806928237	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.729090039842	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.494562676636	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.2748005933	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.245489306861	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.195398763572	Think about that.
0.0	0.39501687164	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.954390733056	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.20906014739	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.207858720266	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.227331020346	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.110948051929	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.179475080702	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.134261965069	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.598671395438	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.771279470912	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.680489657763	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.365633548783	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.0930024788496	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.133414775344	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.238568818318	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.879949616154	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.285928141982	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.439608408575	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.613546972498	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.166114098677	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.320004046647	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.760083841127	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.134750989231	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.11215578668	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.144619258427	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.0818505520546	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.169485484989	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.842863601195	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.293970964088	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.172206615951	OK?
0.0	0.148390849491	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.33848832895	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.481881172825	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.434443267131	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.54460559498	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.164088433156	I'll say this.
0.0	0.714789065127	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.708093371142	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.865671595218	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.296341000949	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.736443319208	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.536625804958	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.132581859083	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.298225964795	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.130137266778	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.202573079768	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.793040995839	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.517531703644	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.100977688327	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.636498379304	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.272508030816	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.270267633398	You do legislation.
0.0	0.180068418545	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.144436386893	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.306833491813	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.202885839493	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.668653497019	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
1.0	0.192105030098	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.24148827272	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.571409887295	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.167145449588	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
1.0	0.261815596952	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.396946202053	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.347752528683	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.307686045985	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.293854445798	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.595855226691	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.467209931601	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.853769567044	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.657067668803	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.591589353173	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.85004368406	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.218679978187	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.123868027879	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.107800827449	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.869924940999	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.238433518887	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.151554637326	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.159014391252	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.595869763823	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.159296274016	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.829452008579	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.543652732672	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.305284344979	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.111597444981	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.282904209232	He is a good man.
0.0	0.740833339081	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.220158335531	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.60890406019	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.626311979	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.247384135344	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.72990443221	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.287708111044	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.181504953675	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.251926901333	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.807469782779	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.623499732352	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.472740257753	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.462170622199	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.449594854714	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.370523700831	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.677309489389	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.317887974485	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.409278161421	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.449861902568	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.416053955452	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.866754085433	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.561352121385	And so that was his explanation.
1.0	0.620886074994	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.563857831643	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.41226178063	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.312791562245	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.115500982665	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.274950855705	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.354392303987	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.331106580637	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.348068682582	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.783645655692	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.368711323171	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.243911559072	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.0623383222046	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
1.0	0.781024704923	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.207571923735	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.181859058937	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.13942854834	And why?
0.0	0.271050657079	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.880207633955	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.400325716439	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.351895939266	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.0474237484544	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.845272349818	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.43387614976	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.694652356941	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.698790337383	Two points.
0.0	0.12198174344	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.220183904357	Ever.
0.0	0.651369101656	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.455582256661	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.712346261924	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.369004467625	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.227262149582	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.696203275553	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.718693016955	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.208584341367	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.414620834778	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.355247006414	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.178945921336	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.151592183686	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.184503136934	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.29632356591	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.208446768001	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.191318026321	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.195193501244	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.196006754446	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.102711193026	I think you're --
0.0	0.198743937657	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.177033638639	...before I go.
0.0	0.507308940736	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.66396280264	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.385911779237	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.141582402454	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.172206615951	OK?
0.0	0.224988589249	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.22001282416	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.206961176315	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.112393249781	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.623191340218	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.16714224748	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.303415296513	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.12687219415	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.873923984802	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
1.0	0.872179778006	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.787478947558	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.709957762562	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.903947499239	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.869919081449	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.485626333239	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.277901661972	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.212969581402	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.810853916082	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.717945193069	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.249808339603	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.771374611209	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.124582964048	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.431486712509	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.209944064529	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.208053317488	That's for sure.
0.0	0.514575652879	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.458631896282	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.150218753117	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.26674814295	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.225354146157	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.63873979559	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.156431197072	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.621619637899	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.

0.0	0.102522172123	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.758554123815	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.276481441605	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.30155110931	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.522711493967	I have no idea.
1.0	0.766029887742	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.

0.0	0.172206615951	Yes.
1.0	0.908049291952	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.688470476867	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.307947845578	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.961759011077	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.634394029385	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.683960769927	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.10824736006	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.554545762614	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.0471898392363	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.22569726469	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.0590403657942	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.829272566455	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.150333432751	...
0.0	0.0902733840702	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.237620208539	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.789527122159	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.237179461233	Creativity.
0.0	0.601060536028	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.133471993883	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.222879520697	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.351102091883	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.719574513245	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.609994302362	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.358381136717	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.480956668164	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.194303922886	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.621860644587	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.608448026469	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.452604945005	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.366606623715	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.326451480834	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.3856254076	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
1.0	0.661584151247	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.305833794609	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.647062326662	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.363948598912	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.364756953958	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.185909591349	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.115427671703	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.163297005889	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.169328921762	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.453087436057	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.229200207171	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.22901235448	About Medicare?
0.0	0.212886756926	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.132468468991	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.154227476886	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.301931326401	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.196200539076	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.617928769299	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.194025113813	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.73721762895	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.589311015267	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.260545945932	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.261174095317	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.822170146964	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.320446262227	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.735876119798	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.833431623128	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.10769551329	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.28595235815	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.79191486828	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.100945337604	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.913252797902	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.224535977641	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.142148029687	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.292068667109	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.0852279052744	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.182787822139	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.828677553723	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.401025516121	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.729351619387	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.17664589958	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.37295052727	We need security.
0.0	0.499842545238	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.29737272763	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.129180562196	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.621902317089	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.170827235357	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.171317263862	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.567278613619	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.139799526881	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.166191291309	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.676716926479	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.739368104127	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.573751857324	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.212038888893	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.195347033944	Thank you.
0.0	0.275998889628	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.486189645878	We're friends.
0.0	0.157458601347	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.200036197361	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.12088099642	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.206118951386	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.652597115535	What have you got now?
0.0	0.69020108634	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.806361770537	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.288786495026	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.174932783646	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.195347033944	Thank you.
1.0	0.682248485674	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.287920004319	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.0829558237488	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.172206615951	Yeah.
0.0	0.130653693504	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.211082408577	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.403261268024	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.178694744953	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.691080506207	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.77571701713	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.235771578577	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.157961114352	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.650455391291	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.560935068437	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.779172621068	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.269193233404	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.837983835505	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.758770367112	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.676112832235	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.18288268095	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.404147112164	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.169736035635	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.342862131556	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.329506182859	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.680082319593	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.598037681395	They're a scam.
0.0	0.519871956559	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.645660596224	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.144282808112	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.129798340864	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.491198268785	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.498689680014	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.609736649822	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.0676009613524	In all due respect...
0.0	0.177039739155	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.0690024365702	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.592071446061	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.542248751475	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.154063429442	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.288182577232	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.261275966422	And you know what?
0.0	0.186622958442	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.633927426154	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.467036567527	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.563962199638	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.235388013708	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.506707824889	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.323244272474	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
1.0	0.829673026764	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.371725281738	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.271295838112	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.330807377909	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.766737957056	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.228326957481	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.0846839057363	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.

0.0	0.129129901872	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.601046204051	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.151484863101	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?

0.0	0.146106758007	The answer is simple.
1.0	0.896719951803	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.150738269366	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.795504797021	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.582918392957	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.658249223449	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.227427063646	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.0394518497265	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.

0.0	0.243217147801	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
1.0	0.67168427394	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.197874252987	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.303642641958	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.

0.0	0.229679880129	They shouldn't be going to Europe.

0.0	0.670025744035	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.230889381298	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.189708893742	(LAUGHTER)

0.0	0.635264118968	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.789138458503	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.609725208674	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.135688348761	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.119195506508	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.

0.0	0.726916081134	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.162716853529	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.753328844003	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.214777976214	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.756543808224	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.12910442864	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.713233294647	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.0713979985106	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.289857208313	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.661692410647	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.09980806582	No, it's true.
0.0	0.624020906903	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.212181435068	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.214261210185	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.445372415906	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.148201883617	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.677897949975	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.16287536611	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.1830688861	Wait for what?
0.0	0.290826400068	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.164356409996	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.371095844219	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.214318411587	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.204990827732	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.295812967058	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.281287043605	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.243563643158	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.0903189747812	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.154175993465	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.393135876083	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.247729346805	I win.
0.0	0.126386263281	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.509790523249	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.37913806639	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.716540630595	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.706792717155	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.273822072175	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.262087118307	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.643753614848	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.798485765831	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.206373692843	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.260545286356	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.571409887295	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.195347033944	Thank you.
0.0	0.498668891255	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.495140478421	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.581983412562	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.698549386396	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.397152294552	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.57447188732	I know every one.
0.0	0.181861737408	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.280831717472	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.121009414065	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.587676920764	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.0724063158089	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.26614583672	White people?
0.0	0.405650040517	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.144931529301	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.609712151765	Mr. President, we're not against you.
1.0	0.760757490127	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.

0.0	0.628048607585	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.250903134602	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.77667608525	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.204421974845	Take it from your professors...
1.0	0.80130084522	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.743862490918	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.0864130022612	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.605671999794	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.615862662564	We were wrong.
0.0	0.155365220289	The answer is no.
0.0	0.194898143965	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.154121338332	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.718210779654	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.216662947983	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.73092423802	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.366026173896	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.81951398398	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.188810443936	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.733751812997	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.207441816887	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.545658631576	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.755303679598	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.3276061271	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.0975371079528	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.530420311244	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
1.0	0.835259208745	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.318046087656	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.140881052048	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.779144834125	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.770617498698	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
1.0	0.582407400325	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.170916901752	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.16208635351	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.566107295298	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.230138303423	(inaudible).
0.0	0.268890916307	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.261275966422	And you know what?
0.0	0.287560597706	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.534018302927	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.628900589206	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.247781415736	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.597091889177	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.275470663737	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.0792344922682	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.551421244584	You have to lead.
0.0	0.74176785481	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.653931340374	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.474867509748	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.596431770927	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.69335578835	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.622634636914	That's fine.
0.0	0.675931378487	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.160447855212	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.376944446728	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.16033688256	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.623259485537	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.161048803923	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.683282912986	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.315497981625	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.268973119636	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.611032170802	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.517933474016	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.612235775158	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.170416062635	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.633734913188	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.122936447362	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.0983541297048	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.387304952874	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.210910295736	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.767474684001	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.306556500178	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.0813508059205	You find me...
0.0	0.782041370747	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.208811793262	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.170020622548	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.15282241935	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.618639135438	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.74549485755	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.220183904357	Right.
0.0	0.28240674848	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.681309682308	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.187221201727	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.250106951774	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.438068552693	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.417079016248	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.216794595372	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.295856009893	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.148823634481	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.223937955308	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.220249718561	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.145394797941	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.115635470736	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.401031271939	You bet they do.
0.0	0.217545092944	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.218515652719	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.760768933633	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.285197888382	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.761225368657	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.229253783218	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.707824500252	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.27095478972	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.163609764375	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.249373912161	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.937756478093	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.240771585926	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.592257670611	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.205513741352	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.126237235818	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.113393132295	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.745141680455	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.947879648106	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.203751058386	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.146173439866	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.166841316808	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.0680481083247	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.866650224753	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.862292700994	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.206717170834	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.198710963671	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.498108517719	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.585813197544	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.903526450149	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.195347033944	Thank you.
0.0	0.751443489739	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.189851150057	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.222990236728	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.131741746746	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
1.0	0.936794208622	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.685821702695	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.187454991575	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.665880063669	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.144029959615	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.32891776615	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.156275963728	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.753913153772	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.725999028329	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.65081998554	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.909005178842	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.784900398167	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.319051969727	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.173376298774	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.132178223101	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.0932382836501	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.230425728966	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.555335545255	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.247782486491	That's what they're doing.
1.0	0.193007901518	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.259714606628	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.227802874865	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.309051629805	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.314570069881	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.202033103908	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.285404805208	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.497026132272	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.12415445578	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.234422170315	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.161250412512	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.672692707677	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.641701993151	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.523948221671	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.285129726547	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.322603999151	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.203907043533	No.

0.0	0.330858429862	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.183765340048	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.624321439362	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.50236527521	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.492772394154	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.0989149320514	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
1.0	0.83158422611	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.698214947964	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.707075702999	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.173391301599	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.216594446668	This would be devastating for the economy.

0.0	0.759201626429	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.250184213032	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.0772626384748	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.274944436149	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.192329590691	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.520302001593	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.243234744476	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.212350410114	Check it out.
0.0	0.567104873012	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.230708077546	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.617996021552	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.697120295954	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.798974365249	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.164079907993	We don't need that.
0.0	0.165145464208	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.211774287053	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.164031884474	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.629337620413	But I was born here.
0.0	0.337546475672	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.655113905186	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.26779013881	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.739698817869	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.70544959533	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.310128014195	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.259857122977	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.163042678934	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.578275114189	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.205405022712	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.815803476631	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.636480172183	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.0401556954793	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.155835500089	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.327670119413	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.190757982215	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.186425459005	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.162029569017	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.187263746845	But I would add this.
0.0	0.290588002667	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.502620963657	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.221197074077	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.212839760747	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
1.0	0.490927179316	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.261244494049	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?

0.0	0.300596091224	She said the truth.

0.0	0.311801212336	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.694870689787	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.462213707694	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.205778880678	Big difference.
0.0	0.25214395824	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.312338874807	My point is this.
0.0	0.250101329183	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.354258881922	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.183560344011	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.730074322697	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.739290680154	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.608506505713	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.652324741461	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.214667652542	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.

0.0	0.277588150641	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.499588729927	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.865868181637	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.152809731404	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.175545883072	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.330286759705	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.293193360389	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.920906630198	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.15820459643	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.253390931979	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.687184377427	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.398374061368	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.292421140813	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.554950636718	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.148267052901	You just want to...
0.0	0.448400483169	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.

0.0	0.437379316149	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.

0.0	0.436202693977	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.705137771905	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.249393407253	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.

0.0	0.421320253371	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.859492781043	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.192948789629	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.0782890066094	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.0595807192457	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.206731175326	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.664308949046	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.714566178712	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.0711718696786	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.628791604419	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.222776024461	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.273854888815	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.287240278571	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.281247963642	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.294752635684	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.776461593388	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.267224319369	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.621197642683	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.746654265367	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.698450710613	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.693895451338	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.163461398667	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.744024568145	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.400594122953	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0832347548084	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.636721096149	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.728174476946	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.55759724707	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.303823649652	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.654619193609	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.679977652296	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.526418200565	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.244695268997	He's wrong.
0.0	0.285495966578	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.585766011143	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.131541094565	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.486927369898	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.378120223854	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.554218465402	You're right.
0.0	0.179266504519	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.256497191504	We are not France.
0.0	0.517118239275	We have to do something.
0.0	0.202626460937	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.401624203792	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.50369658848	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.207963070055	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.232886448991	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.224949585012	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.765058337161	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.187436977827	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.527070893321	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.752314370994	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.220183904357	Right.
0.0	0.050947747257	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.755671978667	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.605296017611	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.241637396027	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.389769971056	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.170528902964	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.165807876985	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.186295217605	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.261275966422	But you know what?
0.0	0.630039328719	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.301611306207	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.183322489746	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.829827390194	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.282877414372	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.670993634965	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.357569829575	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.348907052027	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.541384407201	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.50487071899	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.65375580739	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.637820858114	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.288913909549	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.315266851356	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.692156548217	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.227964703928	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.182100253388	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.188559156911	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.582834727042	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.538906443339	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.569227381544	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.618459624598	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
1.0	0.428494190997	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.620395354838	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.779247215959	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.24331078355	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.529546201771	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.59965569469	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.70718413012	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.150752695919	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.374992388978	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.358374978278	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.664336822106	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.365624785653	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.701213958406	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.179811037981	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.760667457086	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.355999209641	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.41428942839	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.188085548995	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.446238871067	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.697801284105	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.232556745446	That's good.
0.0	0.318341694191	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.210670831131	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.0791202582852	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.285493799327	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.742090156643	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.261923037077	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.343626872133	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.201411878873	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.794982986214	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.112562342675	And...
0.0	0.220359340231	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.115931894116	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.338619149964	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.211412727088	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.493635846114	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.210860285791	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.432231583065	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.336969563244	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.195347033944	Thank you.
0.0	0.380159507919	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
1.0	0.84452148143	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.105801532451	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.200506520051	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
1.0	0.713154520638	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.241378623731	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.781449733276	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.352955856958	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.0941026961292	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.515189866394	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.820374272304	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.239853401789	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
1.0	0.781131793654	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.106602288647	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.103432155814	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.261373705649	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.554017079324	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.603210948509	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.876644981913	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.242763798227	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.545682986813	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.677756511892	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.585023790799	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.272239841182	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.172206615951	Yes.
0.0	0.654328544975	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.726996621282	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.190766486423	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.216968197887	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.212350410114	Check it out.
0.0	0.106030043634	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.717390820776	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.0942371375526	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.270268049833	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.153926352872	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.618381338328	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.788001216013	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.26895947859	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.27102366928	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.252647783321	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
1.0	0.305745417849	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.227012567807	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.18858058567	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.613434383495	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.0985971354423	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.195669623731	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.273231521781	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.167174889367	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.133091181764	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.218060680421	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
1.0	0.668687629542	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.260209918924	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.168677297933	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.173571780807	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.228221559055	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.247590622967	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
1.0	0.330929840278	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.314623142087	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.0991482656597	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.16551417449	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.146299940996	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.611099289525	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.614793220554	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.851140021129	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.328682282528	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.14330682538	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.635332901551	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.175707891868	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.0961490132726	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.0697131708526	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.196145789387	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
1.0	0.302723201492	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.

0.0	0.708867442163	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.316698713661	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.847116766679	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.154258316342	I have...
0.0	0.0769306378944	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.308875298341	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.710272130812	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.16333799324	It's a joke.
0.0	0.728771443784	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.282402484781	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.163785282925	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.148593726321	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.414532461642	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.630037281079	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.288863022295	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.0929747064533	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.627452500488	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.161480751778	That's what I'm working towards.

0.0	0.426548743958	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.64739765225	I changed that.
0.0	0.220183904357	Absolutely.
0.0	0.195336841843	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
1.0	0.474946947985	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.220183904357	Right.
0.0	0.313923642849	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.

0.0	0.187011544038	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.347861449762	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.648529847032	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.31804482135	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.365052228432	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.709583046952	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.26007868987	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.691710795851	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.261958924678	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.291788249634	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.324989448192	I said no.
0.0	0.263089911945	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.850776125789	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.453416383735	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.419602664268	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.

0.0	0.419273043442	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.21694940718	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.868630487253	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.446128989967	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.69102556884	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.175793907006	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.818439807207	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.

0.0	0.202035878463	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.

0.0	0.617785752569	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.300211036711	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.182497325344	Why is that?
0.0	0.616075337888	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.490067878604	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.634857704232	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.261408118203	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.730891143992	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.658912006028	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.0555456622995	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.282865170829	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.198314505875	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.265769044427	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.236071732785	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.405650040517	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.0969906088933	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.271360091061	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.661881160882	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.387321133079	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.692270775785	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.621133010929	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.265217921498	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.187788630908	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.723476132527	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.184044676217	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.165713952874	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.621837272922	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
1.0	0.752997489938	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.212628067779	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.708428987482	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.583107243553	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.206238108452	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.123908314807	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.22706683464	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.256901548057	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.261275966422	And you know what?
0.0	0.918761423841	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.328576704177	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.503804792092	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.154200755399	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.0883476813805	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.6339145	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.842449987095	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.24743719487	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.540755361751	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.580555701062	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.441063782857	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.128136802697	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.193637961661	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.599573014846	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.1453979732	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.582144069726	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.268525149253	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.540866877537	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.181514928581	We have a country of laws.
1.0	0.864238899277	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.250037768643	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.864349708799	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.148744835244	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.40062601878	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.821430049754	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.269673897087	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.245386336995	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.0739485173459	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.554372763629	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.658439371158	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.266220944929	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.256239004106	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.297235104608	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.964227121404	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.219100336055	in particular.
0.0	0.178228748584	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.261114452819	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.902584535712	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
1.0	0.56773316111	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.560186690258	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.715020697396	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.46507731393	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.377257585327	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.743204151656	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.217111118639	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.16521738496	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.757207253265	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.87313670168	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.166087080814	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.359308284564	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.589658633814	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.812191245542	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.72328870437	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.195609521363	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.805138649422	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.231680637048	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.10825004825	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.672458014653	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.794921638134	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.801195470068	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.683666232497	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.548040207869	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.0869271292567	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.621092245384	They're a scam.
0.0	0.30512718225	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.385773377234	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.0910193833528	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.501872391939	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.652818068049	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.326863023082	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.434900937704	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.810797546534	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.451645478948	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.521209988807	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.614752650532	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.290574274992	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.180593873907	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.689855563364	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.642123444762	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.64261903828	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.19088352076	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.279205322323	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.162348778063	You really can't.
0.0	0.556606314609	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.598259424856	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.171968863156	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.58636484495	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.191609103409	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.453869370204	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.65893855132	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.197685354869	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.419416170787	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.167402107596	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.569155678526	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.219225771061	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.643599870921	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.

0.0	0.664011197585	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.253193529256	There are lids on people's aspirations.

0.0	0.438734591683	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.638326173441	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.202554552114	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.273384951983	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.218607068174	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.620326198212	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.23080460299	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.237618821294	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.6707021535	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.290481303428	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.337972618764	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.195347033944	Thank you.
0.0	0.0890089765104	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.982947390499	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.112562342675	But...
0.0	0.645691355508	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.118812787942	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.539450570798	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.590283425881	I never said that.
0.0	0.916008454909	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.597236293796	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.152480769575	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.684162038415	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.618808190406	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.926764293046	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.0537335744052	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
1.0	0.374746006416	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.353019631592	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.719684143568	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.130721875058	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.198621977527	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.166718672603	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.200169536908	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.334726673956	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.305734581253	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.35218844396	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.590902527338	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.1851329727	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.877232165256	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.595939031401	He does great.
0.0	0.127910176551	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.544009788415	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.657480470288	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
1.0	0.955410895814	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.732632136692	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.48321230534	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.244258756471	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.295475692535	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.321053481948	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.297313694513	That is our government today.
0.0	0.295993629464	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.224425224723	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.208902836166	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.739642563407	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.613098989438	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.359428555863	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.178808175823	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.0909408832206	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.195347033944	Thank you.
0.0	0.151166669912	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.354650967524	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.522746843388	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.76005803346	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.67641515115	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.554055316951	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.148621054167	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.0620942047567	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.641643064004	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.383902584345	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.914525011991	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.248917750135	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.215673884639	We need sound money.
0.0	0.275015739398	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.183429199806	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.106311954126	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.467751349492	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.188194365668	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.294223089662	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.730681547975	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.163577782291	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.589412698098	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.778913314264	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.495021602801	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.265130347989	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.215599318599	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.190476309251	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.129283861508	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.225542536097	I do.
0.0	0.190205967406	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.163457946915	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.186112140065	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.238504328049	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.168156122726	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.208198558019	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.542999503778	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.260508002362	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.203907043533	No.
0.0	0.290371231823	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.632615515161	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.139709109556	But they can't get along.
1.0	0.677647844159	The Oregon study showed this.
1.0	0.715924293781	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.529329789239	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.657349117694	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.227890429028	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.175892259822	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.218823601327	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.730101457374	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.794982986214	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.780946008972	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.210829968915	And we are not England.
0.0	0.197504801202	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.609249971094	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.590283425881	I never said that.
0.0	0.175435365759	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.264175340715	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.208916051373	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.262475444213	You are working at McDonald's?
1.0	0.720632802788	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.293730875918	The big Internet companies.
1.0	0.526492677784	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.181867425043	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.29591099196	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.421428982714	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.204351317374	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.

0.0	0.198685936949	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.264186695686	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.138474118788	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.453509155831	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.295255314597	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.76072570903	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.643570858873	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.16481789863	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.739285889126	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.799104341484	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.

0.0	0.289623138036	So you know what?
0.0	0.457048796417	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.220704804915	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.232646842271	Well I want to comment on this.

0.0	0.436683264905	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.717183120578	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.699994716328	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.223020487945	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.25467939761	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.39851503741	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.587038703447	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.

0.0	0.0448479272265	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
1.0	0.932096568637	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.762742242832	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.718852623726	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.129765810557	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.263708752699	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.35285547038	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.333246294669	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.141839606937	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.711348746978	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.260116786801	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.0368828946213	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.53384767743	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.26546405367	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.779832750297	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
1.0	0.632212348294	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.557641270236	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.253213256677	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.

0.0	0.152555665201	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.832896515986	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.136628304252	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.34544109925	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.150333432751	...
0.0	0.308433783366	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.542766745941	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.41378515918	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.346924102179	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.741951245227	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.04076156506	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.297271941357	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.640564507149	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.223297360683	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.402325919581	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.195634948181	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.174714427882	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.326333891535	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.57842814169	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.303251866763	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.105113611468	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.644785345041	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.204595069823	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.6446797202	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.161730431503	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.249274669706	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.252050598317	That's not right.
0.0	0.127802787698	It feels different.
0.0	0.701269809951	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.283278890735	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.372859590807	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
1.0	0.838361846643	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

0.0	0.306027189962	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.134662971622	But, we can't rest.

0.0	0.863344121496	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.169591103372	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.151554637326	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.183697959854	No, no.
0.0	0.15109101443	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.393028682757	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.259200417182	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
1.0	0.790751267166	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.670964665673	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.659968344786	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.

0.0	0.498674809917	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.237442947608	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.66154034005	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.643474549301	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.557578682443	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.0942169975035	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.222227876467	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.315979877191	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.171742054673	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.692769951789	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.177080273746	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.234683670722	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.688912458978	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.252587676812	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.580105666847	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.750629531515	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.25448575119	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.572169380795	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.171966350149	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.121660900895	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.116112466861	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.14811174604	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.774178154496	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.777003737197	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.660847324362	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.269412080598	But then his poll numbers tanked.
1.0	0.682146081049	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
1.0	0.287297233936	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.517064320948	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.724698141083	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
1.0	0.460248285446	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.615574212715	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.175670148072	I will not do that.
0.0	0.68058230516	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.170289510554	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.846394785963	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.631686209828	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.16844280116	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.592563500058	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.6445574542	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.532952459738	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.238328510979	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
1.0	0.618021153024	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.177785439596	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.647948662259	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.474714576098	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.795102090029	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.378149187547	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.109941413117	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.462212274649	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.118370129179	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.232753988416	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.128534578958	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.233394191329	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.178540982049	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.189739544641	You can have him.
0.0	0.59211196671	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.725045624168	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.160911647205	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.283034359512	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.665249690831	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.190546289835	You know why?
0.0	0.120788990959	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.329121795343	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.622716431848	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.233417001144	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.432023843855	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.203907043533	No.
0.0	0.242267817395	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.17457785622	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
1.0	0.892386806773	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.697189918165	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.264456259342	My background is different.
0.0	0.801653910129	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.622637394462	She was right.
0.0	0.524297109357	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.621521764542	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.275799520229	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.191454774077	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.930845859861	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.689372672697	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.237089908289	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.551040634297	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.381467690924	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.26603587372	That is important.
1.0	0.773215833254	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.234960201588	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.436735942396	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.130190569688	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.250483105335	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.198289024596	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.799900466726	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.222039460441	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.29123294843	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.702185918148	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.330655299567	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.233224808466	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.69703945331	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.123341212881	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.779566117428	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.237371222669	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.302952898393	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.592406677087	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.601285395226	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.272852364159	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.370902257031	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.421921347062	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.8211574317	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.883275894676	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.351183018485	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.621580646351	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.674304379098	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.719672037296	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.357455840669	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.62201291881	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.457994185505	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.140211810903	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.0712331956221	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.380036150248	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.211778215918	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.229487869548	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.646580066913	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.246323351998	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.910468106513	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.278928054329	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.216930907049	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.504757448164	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.151704588566	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.682679808789	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.235068459513	It is.
0.0	0.210792181523	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.192019567438	I understand.
0.0	0.101944627419	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
1.0	0.720520457327	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.131802380887	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.357738948588	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.666712200167	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.0550296113026	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.147289997397	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.170160787587	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.317721557963	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.173176502272	Well, sure.
0.0	0.179161170182	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.536672677892	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.636269201887	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.496605815885	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.756076299726	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.210089987545	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.762317542934	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.748955039013	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.337977612896	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.067794537646	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.726937145829	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.623175499758	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.801372334691	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.260805632468	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.582742458563	We don't win.
0.0	0.177909068922	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.15185656776	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.465606813697	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.270057603184	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.735173425548	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.601955783406	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.452556414235	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.700755277661	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.208033803748	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.226265775244	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.205449233257	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.168920517803	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.534218218529	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.268934596124	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.309074523661	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.56665538941	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.282135531584	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
1.0	0.817791777622	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.299248226707	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.531737184785	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.470981572187	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.213088113234	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.12019927472	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.267596025899	That's right.
0.0	0.565483462674	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
1.0	0.172866532645	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.361182740386	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.750962886503	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.49169864506	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.120387299122	And here's why.
0.0	0.491544946652	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.287274799178	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.302545874036	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.758446981372	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.659981334307	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.299160188667	On welfare.
0.0	0.161567467323	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.279835663194	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.351187471534	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.153142197046	Again...
0.0	0.463458053574	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
