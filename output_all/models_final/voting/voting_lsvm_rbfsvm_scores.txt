0.0	0.329336023256	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.266256705567	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.213304592786	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.400598216652	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.270003848636	We're running.
1.0	0.658895692617	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.290928570843	John?
0.0	0.455478803815	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.257862809832	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.285229785275	About Medicare?
0.0	0.283494478683	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.395817029939	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.26284504106	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.268905907256	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.537779738658	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.285502008037	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.307185872929	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.450007056316	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.495905369435	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.757784611924	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.172255407809	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.39634695378	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.329209710413	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.368887199694	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.386757530104	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.388812461345	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.298195854047	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0668935740531	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.198548754886	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.148488187024	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.447602961525	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.161018935576	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.295642065617	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.292735464787	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.570174142603	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.54014495715	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.436744723794	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.332073428757	That's not true.
0.0	0.472919297744	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.687216549352	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.340752836581	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.172068101514	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.460414851768	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.164940220704	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.433065709499	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.668887202407	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.232488095194	This will end.
0.0	0.0582197514475	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.727649395366	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.53226560978	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.359208579328	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.275959574259	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.451489216388	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.703172639808	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.423192860256	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.544767518595	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.44299174502	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.401106609871	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.516575331604	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.275665063062	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.518999771803	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.238972477978	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.208403526337	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.181351544433	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.205164924833	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.328571738403	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.53880400347	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.0800423449673	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.258653555211	Thank you.
0.0	0.333125754153	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.407118969847	He's wrong.
0.0	0.402454814843	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.368243372815	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.497882952646	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.670711635282	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.466786399023	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.384598463612	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.796869032755	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.53184120108	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.125501925496	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.247378852628	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.467182077216	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.130458940668	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.446224060998	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.340947910945	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.686628033063	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.554274307938	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.466777907574	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.665434040823	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.713872990193	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.668610471598	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.766099547343	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.28942280785	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.44321266679	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.202461550413	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.33872623014	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.189605204473	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.258653555211	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.325294895405	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.229204147596	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.668586162032	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.61306415452	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.761884844963	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.525305044095	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.492783746639	You're simply not.
0.0	0.465404548727	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.508796763376	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.226443116583	I will not do that.
0.0	0.212129188101	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.274525253662	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.183667052558	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.819929648452	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.685903600825	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.46997294589	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.686783197416	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.295000311077	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.232052334741	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.693662129654	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.345978260125	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.26724666719	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.15252200064	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.440028838179	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.714874756812	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.387136755776	On welfare.
0.0	0.566196800958	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.451124550601	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.159170531226	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.161947752465	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.335386773388	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.450551542405	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.45037792945	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.225012520854	You find me...
0.0	0.410317064027	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.523777728189	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.591976940917	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.226730598811	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.507083801377	He was on the board.
0.0	0.453145981505	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
1.0	0.465847277817	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.349473499713	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.419186496712	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0878686876886	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.287249396398	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.582665675729	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.221673245629	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.45605101437	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.478230047953	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.386519947839	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.459037297143	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.606556912504	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.659085658606	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
1.0	0.77879837324	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.516320581894	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.299893228843	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.277140729233	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.54781633965	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.435590593407	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.316361722565	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.205156424307	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.459381283339	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.364148285742	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.199597922534	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.642372203853	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.809770700585	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.526239303481	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.147139918557	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.270523174748	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.618791304961	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.935051479021	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.418793060351	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.648699002778	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.346583979721	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.13875415478	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.196925385976	...before I go.
0.0	0.445687934532	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.652704033037	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.67624174666	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.194008012886	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.736152292082	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.42217063516	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.301214589981	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.455190448952	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.411530596457	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.239160103481	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.548122021503	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
1.0	0.47760664774	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
1.0	0.450498883262	They stole it.
0.0	0.542014903159	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.727806727295	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.238728596342	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.505870053787	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.603721730734	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.26142477779	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.833232332899	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.177046778281	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.369986073918	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.178024764813	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.340090990422	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.228698573528	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.349516765998	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.290116032692	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.255477309496	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.670942210635	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.

0.0	0.407054825946	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.534706431945	I was recruited to H.P.

0.0	0.678969782297	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.824406564703	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.534980537046	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.46137135408	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.442432446361	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.282255017543	So you might not.
0.0	0.413418056664	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.178784729493	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.0319578894901	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.372959115688	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.495813506692	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.47839349053	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?

0.0	0.301688220066	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.185053920215	I like that.
0.0	0.160349633582	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...

0.0	0.442084311975	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.

0.0	0.483370954286	I said no.
0.0	0.102904528142	Good luck making something out of this mess."

0.0	0.440218502816	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.245865303955	And let me make a final point on this.
1.0	0.574181991173	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.3506387784	And that's what I intend to do.

0.0	0.270067602318	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.437386815725	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.222231906628	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.340834975921	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.187878279391	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.365768151664	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.

0.0	0.197070735128	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.306436110104	Creativity.
0.0	0.28129571219	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.327571260499	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.199015923806	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.2044351928	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.242733256704	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.353496420369	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.337101422916	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.138285483969	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?

0.0	0.388910716872	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.419817068018	I have many friends that deal with China.

0.0	0.306925975918	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.344202027237	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.182821221677	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.683399466516	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.286695840972	No.
0.0	0.845313652192	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.399260213911	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.28823904303	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.684326495384	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.563269799171	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.357995091226	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.715387503211	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.429493088223	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.733600577311	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.526861164394	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.463090973342	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.365480516519	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.550532097367	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.123933720584	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.209308860289	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.506816551879	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.736100737941	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.430974414836	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.482652363679	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.480210307614	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.539578543988	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.351907655983	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.868985366941	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.219624203213	You just want to...
0.0	0.421468592823	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.545280594069	He hit oil.
0.0	0.216444717459	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.301535413779	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.462312928247	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.22627030721	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.440439700147	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.158866516856	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.208258080777	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.582461994093	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.561901198806	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.293108292414	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.101852000592	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.362580666275	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.263605933314	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.575425640918	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.195542383921	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.670679317963	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.359800264607	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.201279204408	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.627813140108	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.644784219816	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.173929256789	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.598338499566	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.375330724838	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.276194536279	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.225141614744	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.163101903367	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.498611398984	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.391367562086	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.129304732909	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.24542681111	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.472283012945	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.355735027452	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.276948103208	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.383316706922	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.613791434296	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.289162364277	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.271077419642	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.329134909575	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.51018436166	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.611963781948	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.510640770163	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.389914740552	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.774164009621	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.336249436499	It is.
0.0	0.0443291533855	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
1.0	0.968563708574	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.256121491155	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.929761195306	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.0513191417701	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.831434152725	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.214177821824	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.253171881181	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.425201931441	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.68317478515	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.117249899077	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.383583848382	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.352460455594	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.400267172822	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.195992305268	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.186207500239	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.371736280539	That is important.
0.0	0.204190519738	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.27922283482	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.22508160301	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.289793197174	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.247076492653	How about this?
0.0	0.59051290942	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.396295760599	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.338633328147	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.315972188567	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.348722267252	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.531325672897	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
1.0	0.545189627346	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.266950589571	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.316321447075	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.541408679494	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.272319695445	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.433663336325	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.396411689443	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.471475368396	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.500047417943	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.496099128431	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.400446209249	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.245232351866	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.145788089775	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.366652864317	He's wrong.
0.0	0.508924823507	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.441493030664	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.712616830005	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.55990374299	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.497305977801	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.295520696216	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.554483208134	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
1.0	0.911737012773	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
1.0	0.794485853291	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.448235146112	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.268877759354	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.480944393732	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.428675057877	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.254132036177	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.751379069005	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.314955095071	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.489909312947	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.241854892148	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.316992927507	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.329880923274	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.668243366327	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.416454662075	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.502375618226	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.652585001434	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.09585077603	And guess what?
0.0	0.278219578129	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.674143853476	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.337300578644	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.249478445252	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.576931748262	Of course not.
0.0	0.563941776115	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.376379247204	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.517337470759	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.352195338764	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.418506418089	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.222064050113	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.561654793345	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.438934167204	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.441818428827	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.318649253724	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.332964316898	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.36102732037	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.286586647332	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.249478728322	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.282696377023	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.242589630491	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.758167639731	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.345189667389	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.437003967288	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.151665993666	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.479936188815	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.29257312147	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.546582242834	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.647151046867	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.407807459034	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.237567392046	So...
0.0	0.423044083078	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.442839864883	...10% flat rate...
1.0	0.777706974908	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.468686160648	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.411883244541	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.358726999629	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.303475111122	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.56423755426	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.392039392491	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.690941491042	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.544403272378	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.204978117963	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.454145449737	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.403998553285	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.53927585339	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.957394210207	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.238217561171	That's what we need.
0.0	0.203958225476	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.359265460422	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.463642227075	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.421637942044	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.518529186774	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.152806050632	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.260725943274	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.52042570121	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.574479209299	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.617295083517	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.595327633702	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.473530943871	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.389109209522	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.408317329647	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.597289316409	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.416032382117	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.547861155454	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.32048572396	I think he is right.
0.0	0.401738642683	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.417205210744	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.274353158879	We need to rebuild our families.
1.0	0.71768388572	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.59103835201	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.34681699491	Get over that one, OK?
1.0	0.51503960866	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.640550003999	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.385114385541	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.782766515138	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.409557852521	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.576870832045	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
1.0	0.561970165783	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.478770833487	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.796623794064	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.380011970582	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.245985592459	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.448903498147	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.198168029584	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.302995076356	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.605845581981	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.227620218003	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.291984570459	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.259194870415	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.28168905151	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.415177152337	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.370318595991	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.189605204473	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.230860134253	You're welcome.
0.0	0.321797599356	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.699619639739	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.309818384964	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.373508251457	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.40650465533	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.27106509546	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.238433097998	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.492340114153	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.298331053532	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.382349677007	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.2226692522	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.397647167042	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.27182222736	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.526318264768	The world has changed.
0.0	0.18312170449	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.52164774503	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.531632100326	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.405383278405	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.451603756549	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.268969630761	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.381864702417	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.794592831168	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.491567565615	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.57974639115	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.280899365553	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.620710143048	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.793438856779	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.322883228264	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.395150104393	This is 2016.
0.0	0.592110440444	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.545635253521	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.262020355653	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.264274851043	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.380475188975	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.372483796386	That's my bill.
0.0	0.566971785931	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.617835942785	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.317105631857	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.366699379525	It goes away.
0.0	0.432407083875	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.509024770622	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.652126534385	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.390704286275	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.241230031654	It's not working.
0.0	0.400732588175	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.391694201386	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.470676623161	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.443769762501	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.730593119604	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.254715298268	I have...
0.0	0.286645619295	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.70642743442	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.576029299812	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.489563157652	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.378239932294	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.299641824754	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.239600458633	And God bless America.
0.0	0.636209316187	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.362257608545	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.642002584066	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.431861292818	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.733934668164	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.308126033136	You do.
0.0	0.311887458976	My background is different.
0.0	0.296008534264	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.249852225553	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.507456190269	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.716774246821	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.759557516221	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.666615155974	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.19181477029	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
1.0	0.516573779865	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.299481240397	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.35432582528	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.516011158431	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.448143598891	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.344884742722	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.327483141986	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.196670722605	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.148269691055	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.529350921786	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.416404182089	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.379967732565	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.395691640382	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.660234666484	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.200390725179	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.156354572157	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.498356154341	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.24799396152	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.327896561052	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.659319243871	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.499891570632	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.447723066478	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.277707401526	We can't do this unilaterally.
1.0	0.703543915945	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.399067828057	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.167367053154	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.380219525046	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.756151800847	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.203623909046	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.370406406324	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.60275306998	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.326018459897	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.275617383053	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.436254379803	You know why three?
0.0	0.243105806384	Yes.
0.0	0.180882921491	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.223516146438	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.426592846092	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.261096263965	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.357816799408	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.513059127765	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.356057504959	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.213575471397	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.255088082966	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.312871493043	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.4124917408	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.238943112328	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.26623708562	Good at email.
0.0	0.51658946241	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.0597528768338	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.424597776111	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.592929808059	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.497893748255	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.370100421752	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.398436466589	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.479172847766	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.346631789294	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.34622185801	No vision at all.
0.0	0.302387347103	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
1.0	0.582589354876	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
1.0	0.885583598194	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.134974324854	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.446743690895	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.918614787608	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.354083736234	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.345035503416	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.128995990809	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.239031106673	I would just say that...
0.0	0.730459675405	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.330676557781	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.586113138606	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.159124590805	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.241585525848	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.672024506768	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.789259469012	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.197123148674	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.431315164782	They are trying to attack us here in America.
1.0	0.818278604438	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.185804531313	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.52218797888	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.66517148374	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.452540905874	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.300531869635	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
1.0	0.577819303106	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.251427616036	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.572179253768	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.2607336053	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.190479340619	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.779646273062	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.262555262951	I can do that.
0.0	0.3772739408	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.316746372809	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.278546188082	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.260050012683	They know.
0.0	0.805183507727	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.315381818441	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
1.0	0.434353621699	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
1.0	0.218463905308	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.485574974991	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.557417521975	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.51116624741	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.350415916705	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.441553293092	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.651007469156	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.462779893938	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
1.0	0.320104015281	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.408296285621	I never said that.
0.0	0.604578648266	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.52523434706	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.205867162238	I will do that.
0.0	0.568915719597	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.404080913532	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.402712666048	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.544591181805	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.475618238535	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.23137118709	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.395584805846	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.194387342639	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.271602936002	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.476448106169	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.118476346123	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.578610103478	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.294782777858	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.472760926442	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.661488747494	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.349537108197	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.387460932918	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.564413225472	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.148410740587	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.316041958694	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
1.0	0.758695742635	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
1.0	0.553290785918	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.657455325537	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.29161172654	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.414066059991	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.316473835929	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.314851703575	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.159998645499	But...
0.0	0.103364669288	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.245493518526	Divide that out.
0.0	0.460842934973	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.598511151264	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.37188708835	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.409970609003	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.449841825074	That never works.
0.0	0.514732607862	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.481641674765	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.339229042944	We don't win.
0.0	0.46837250642	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.490776621683	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.307950753865	But you know what?
0.0	0.319671142588	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.462358772426	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.181302897881	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.458489135708	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.215141844169	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.424804274053	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.284931197589	You know that.
0.0	0.257500416163	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.452229205055	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.21894168577	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.194630877939	Well, sure.
0.0	0.320330128305	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.231075893893	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.169609757746	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.31126665183	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.51597965752	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
1.0	0.442164948889	Very few children.
0.0	0.130514945392	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.227922057478	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.426981747365	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.434711138734	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.31106029286	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.105381531615	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.508686721573	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.280464849634	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.185415013102	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.691228334346	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.838745523323	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.625148870091	She voted for it.
0.0	0.310363782862	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.219510994891	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
1.0	0.76097668158	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.500513715281	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.142366970863	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.342268202296	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
1.0	0.522546824809	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
1.0	0.628387987885	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.165290452847	It feels different.
0.0	0.201096318583	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.110536134316	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.233995497687	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.692342113333	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.687439653311	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.277545131759	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.368925821992	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.469686758085	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.223295766755	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.205898577283	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.467628675286	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.55847380028	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
1.0	0.437047534075	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.242148464711	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.187795251445	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.252161256409	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.546665904489	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.341924725827	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.362077110508	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.34414220896	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.419314391879	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.630020951192	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.226761548762	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.32801959534	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.380296839865	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.219055078635	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.247938585511	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.495747116956	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.24408194667	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.139943213163	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.188612674707	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.340797712751	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.347090265415	That's good.
0.0	0.304774238085	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.504890941793	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.47423764216	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.194234640967	No -- no...
0.0	0.254034425303	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.283497608848	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.209925055694	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.182751982827	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.524240787692	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.354130847323	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.548713383927	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.329385910373	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.381666188858	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.281049117911	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
1.0	0.38127708521	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.367066338456	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.480230886636	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.470712806375	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.583063982476	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.598410933613	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.628124646817	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.620960819899	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.32248938824	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.50578882655	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.456815229122	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.563855163121	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.662320294304	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.201933931592	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.407112624732	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.279849361537	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.238328955974	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.425224318593	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.840736569672	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.177480044856	...Chris...
0.0	0.691780732631	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.192370005904	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.471727369894	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.672608263076	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.402212985335	No, you did.
0.0	0.708711974725	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.429805787611	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.310949671624	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.358814573837	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.118169963576	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.551230676346	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.368918088181	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.303857846908	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.0383238550503	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.185601714166	I agree with them.
0.0	0.543029681523	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.408619551057	We actually did it.
0.0	0.20068845969	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.390999638048	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.249149374736	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.199476666695	We're running.
1.0	0.805259692748	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.286690296348	This country is changing.
0.0	0.66888619846	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.30599262428	to save a company.
0.0	0.280194720358	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.163955936579	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.477581536113	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.239700564256	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.582006094785	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.246878242914	...
0.0	0.155283292142	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.132824923897	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.326062268168	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.215599722098	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.528222401729	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.487930361604	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.426842460361	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.724482853002	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.490605480775	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.283883363065	And we are not England.
0.0	0.558494603261	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.427967860239	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.734407026991	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.507967917204	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.467721684675	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
1.0	0.770084474387	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.224604783885	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.415732685777	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.225377670622	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.312117076826	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.123283959097	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.305029703574	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.283666105084	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.342338168491	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.369796688671	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.648304636092	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.37619839347	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.795053619662	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.209410934263	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.334982273287	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.595424788302	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.344451735588	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.143371767826	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.353552992021	It's a joke.
0.0	0.320719548541	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.313254751369	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.250177537719	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.229907102113	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.440248519616	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.371917529567	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.324006391849	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.380371536094	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.41747676787	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.458002483408	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.420737289918	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.23965125543	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.193656114121	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.532562074289	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.15428893976	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.125739137732	In all due respect...
0.0	0.293630867062	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.805248117067	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.591361628893	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.359577574643	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.0904320425088	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.531995878268	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.243105806384	Okay.
0.0	0.340535530207	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.246137076746	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.378956370871	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.355919136485	We're friends.
0.0	0.499542726565	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.362495543163	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.669458053644	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.10395313907	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.377174645354	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.536605809378	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.402252230908	They were wrong.
0.0	0.327856545883	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.0902089358586	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.154797854272	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.259229722007	Came out great.
0.0	0.174545790316	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.457608491186	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.368205413682	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.36482640232	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.659586264876	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.195541949535	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.220949644505	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.371414162523	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.401952349195	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.292798044578	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.695695421696	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.240291620226	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.131984972108	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.644424672001	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.58297420772	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.22649563769	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.200278598433	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.444342725276	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.37999194574	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.621420228461	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.297258302238	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.493576063826	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.305778311401	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.296854557541	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.373060800397	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.537478544641	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.494122873638	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.213050995243	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.24624574541	Check it out.
0.0	0.338497028506	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.126853043626	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.447047950171	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.238519606556	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.839752050139	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.332417590115	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.591478762894	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
1.0	0.934423386913	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.652522508408	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.123271078224	CRUZL But I will say --
1.0	0.566770921039	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.769994421457	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.232788755258	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.518831192161	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.791812991941	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.436348811078	She was right.
0.0	0.470818280393	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.225815993825	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.428414213185	I looked at the evidence.
1.0	0.719316576707	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.243105806384	Yes.
0.0	0.583964114403	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.56157408358	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.426862703827	But I was born here.
0.0	0.323116357649	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.251380552992	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.258653555211	Thank you.
0.0	0.404843818497	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.35984617025	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.457072600097	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.775985090642	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.410947372756	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.390452206117	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.227707108857	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.333964779213	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.321264326239	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.699196954321	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.727582468049	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.531057857763	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.117620029413	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.252600308299	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.387286524882	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.24484391068	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
1.0	0.879220972113	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.661838884782	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.696405060431	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.415626610684	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.353673537628	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.246878242914	...
0.0	0.405378162186	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.453112558545	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.354412355716	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.629300825757	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.197123328118	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.670059680553	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.374180692083	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.308303002863	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.467132177405	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.199430539863	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.210569943968	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.431963378437	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.574309789143	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.88244053178	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.379015819993	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.334442452248	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.316236880218	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.510553571619	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.711508699967	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.408296285621	I never said that.
0.0	0.152916645793	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.408444052934	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.358883560716	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.301060500488	In addition to that...
0.0	0.459951218942	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.257840072943	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.219203158803	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
1.0	0.580812029378	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.477039932608	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.630956416883	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.462266578563	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.368249221517	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.226083938828	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.792353381729	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.185724817105	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.351945767271	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.22924384035	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.397506642857	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.359803780937	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.312790087456	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.231150523807	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.463392886605	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.352092615305	I changed that.
1.0	0.79250194554	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.402001208835	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.144002664057	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.207945133502	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.686272540168	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.30514404608	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.313620525779	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.21925534592	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
1.0	0.274448284606	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.915980854955	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.242603675899	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.29561317562	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.379745358693	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.639964517408	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.187036640505	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.376914007551	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.190317989893	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.104305768308	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.376929501831	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.504090710252	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.299340662444	Big difference.
0.0	0.81039151739	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.191309176833	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.155351188309	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.288890352902	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.0613500766943	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.226122476547	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.614589546262	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.61121985632	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.39560390087	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.47132519975	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.188520556302	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.470495675789	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.29586699627	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.193519759039	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.475618238535	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.34628390218	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.263484952484	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.220899750521	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.45799232599	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.496790542286	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?

0.0	0.508367251883	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.493591060696	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.38648027759	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.568438965839	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.3549074464	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.276717520102	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.5	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.387133222867	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.516178734108	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.431598955961	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.570732213178	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.329818327693	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.42547809306	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.517233783145	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.289460023028	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.723147503843	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.31775155248	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.187036640505	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.174125514922	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.470234715054	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.421304090013	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.489629618216	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.367819025817	It's their money.
0.0	0.286302291054	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.284994958397	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.591990021273	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.341581115741	So you know what?
0.0	0.536392530441	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.5760192858	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.459908280842	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.191922423458	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.0515355905299	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.381878073722	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.639225950013	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.759932637684	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.113079932632	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.551774854477	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.613749331388	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.122124691478	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.263268632758	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.260427413042	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.795854036668	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.392592731694	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.231716299438	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.87993356904	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.174959210282	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.343289624737	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.213646630799	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
1.0	0.789113405843	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.572775751925	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.540627416604	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.711508699967	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.781033544346	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.738070839675	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.163444542866	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.23832189825	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.503637672867	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.206933235373	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.483266767518	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.446677994891	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.856753530304	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.711538860226	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.382568269163	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.519184814941	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.413780026238	Just for the record.
0.0	0.680291243869	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.442431783445	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.215523851812	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.521752779431	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.677506202949	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.390904952951	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.54833169632	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.333554640734	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.168205937535	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.252608439838	That's for sure.
0.0	0.266202255253	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.277189587808	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.226405091657	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.405555954267	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.32470680182	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.385258556095	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.37436744616	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.42688167641	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.835437209263	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.290928570843	Alright.
0.0	0.326967534678	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.703472749333	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.512509012641	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.398485288818	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.137493856767	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.179646478376	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.243105806384	OK?
0.0	0.321226424115	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.359291687995	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.236378843645	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.445037667551	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.272827240565	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.271599023348	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.39578004175	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.154114454534	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.284920907349	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.473561318906	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.66187028457	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.591655377581	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.783678910795	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.478307377628	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.733841945001	I've got five grandkids.
1.0	0.725429784933	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.290394154602	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.258039045963	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.481932234545	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.813142138372	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.307950753865	And you know what?
0.0	0.217110872747	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.28385003592	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.467625215425	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.305525532341	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.397716970912	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.438964155759	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.387130638883	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.465572866254	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.137087788998	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.0579199604071	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.300115240191	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.215179518239	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.446816760465	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.550419038813	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
1.0	0.795753211064	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.385946352183	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.112558367517	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.470410001201	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.338834883518	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.438749905389	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.298609746435	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.254307987022	Think about it.
0.0	0.237567392046	Again...
0.0	0.216153421914	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.539415138492	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.545499517442	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
1.0	0.347903580175	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.269555372245	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.656028234483	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.292192896519	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.521772549861	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.67998835817	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.62960358263	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
1.0	0.838182069127	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
1.0	0.596338021456	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.371461235435	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.434689071125	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.768058856181	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.237075315995	What should we do?
0.0	0.69613305469	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.26351961292	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.415936490423	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.310645904851	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.223743806811	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.270661628718	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.682037205451	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.748139524831	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.276582541917	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.748389348004	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.449072725049	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.330106698997	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.247070732811	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.471746236789	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.

0.0	0.452786444702	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.343313488025	I'm ready.
0.0	0.427776557617	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.429959396306	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.616390874093	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.222816046084	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.419184604313	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.313887118473	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.513674471546	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.653176166651	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.300721361458	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.140440009873	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.471135128315	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.287622623066	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.315158451774	But I would add this.
0.0	0.121399871083	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.262078064666	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.287054288663	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.666992850936	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.23859440827	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.754802521993	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.457556415293	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.804292765492	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.221402556143	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.205581529709	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.381232923801	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.509947704796	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.713075159831	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.1428454292	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.435659735322	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.144332414187	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.241574747636	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.347785333895	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.4381693629	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.230483565444	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.325820857914	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.296381748381	I voted yes to suspend that.
1.0	0.311079267126	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.577892507274	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.306325297275	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.364632067635	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.287073430473	Absolutely.
0.0	0.578362516721	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.343804959084	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.273914485727	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.256733509348	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.172737933046	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.655822566107	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.508409897008	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.350830217179	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.248504606258	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.214806141763	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.459593157376	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.477760053518	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.267670641688	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.150843009522	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.877350390419	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.306854609174	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.267537852401	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.759070825107	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.33143920124	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.304794930213	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.107972681311	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.208296454158	Why is that?
0.0	0.392733744739	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.342520634237	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.682675261288	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.256687220594	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.480396988631	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.455771677744	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.439649639129	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.265388685114	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.376957399107	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.170429759183	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.495651139077	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.347183406637	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.266551587636	I can.
0.0	0.206964918253	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.101855136965	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.329609502927	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.590840508042	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.393995224527	They're a scam.
0.0	0.332816982396	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.202719092838	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.386069479662	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.258653555211	Thank you.
0.0	0.938109526025	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.551440007844	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
1.0	0.348679602711	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.151809576489	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.29257695906	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.6582073027	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.0722638176391	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.366699379525	It never happens.
0.0	0.470503502526	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.286695840972	No.
0.0	0.230570617908	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.308173074304	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.423793919813	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.561710943327	That is not protected free speech.
1.0	0.317639666449	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.326656120958	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.366015430079	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.254307987022	Think about it.
0.0	0.443165697309	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.30401465665	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.515961133624	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.663919593614	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.225055559301	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.815419938459	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.264763520803	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.754485651937	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.436571319299	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.354626093251	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.666380937899	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.43286903211	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.301113037841	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.180113948162	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.576119735474	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.374768784126	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.827822022285	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.307950753865	And you know what?
0.0	0.500253656196	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.443861320372	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.475403447857	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.691946094746	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.174762539538	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.422966441778	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.279115114915	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.426490176766	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.2059455923	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.527116427078	I changed it in New Jersey.
1.0	0.633007280739	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.306078163802	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.312452680793	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.327086980271	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.387879881478	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.207539894889	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.265606381391	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.499613387501	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.567510598964	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.280633549928	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.344005107788	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.244570979765	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.215547028187	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.248579600331	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.474723582084	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.672535323267	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.344169390465	A brief response.
0.0	0.359123425656	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.728623370525	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.239368283109	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.38736053007	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.350803695392	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.619131839866	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.706879846948	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.561633507161	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.319897695581	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.299743379537	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.476080276438	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.276850389786	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.15150717787	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.386015918629	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.243705126814	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.419948145209	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.275939128277	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.322066348526	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.653505326091	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.578820338235	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.151062449022	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
1.0	0.515097337675	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.402711235308	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.38864779278	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.254023055852	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.25460107845	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.672775571987	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.415892823832	I'm tested.
0.0	0.484183018037	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.264950424832	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.264963694253	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.409054221113	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.317478882279	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.391834489085	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.215500976158	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.153797497291	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.373986856886	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.286695840972	No.
0.0	0.682520414042	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.792333535687	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.166462122821	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.259604031871	We can't do it.
0.0	0.278802645443	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.198061210521	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.400032215676	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.567266858659	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.351042050008	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.349096846604	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.19386669535	...Thank you.
0.0	0.481008446	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.383112348266	White people?
0.0	0.210570661409	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
1.0	0.764277691262	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.454692471638	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.374283653463	I've done it.
0.0	0.308126033136	I do.
0.0	0.538515250293	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.315839196413	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.227230639177	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.527726619467	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.412127966081	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.420655571565	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.201377400887	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.148767569469	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.675495999289	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.417293867021	I will show you what they do to women.
1.0	0.580186627751	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.356154714412	That is absolutely not right.
1.0	0.951333171864	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.373417791445	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.328984049424	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.811887083114	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.669357126997	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.148461793621	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.11234308719	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.175825557466	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.441700465889	That's fine.
0.0	0.246488585715	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.36456379185	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.553581246142	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.579242211917	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.38630850298	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.453015910534	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.374437912792	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.457288077144	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.322378004026	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.311457841768	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.412858778127	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.535086289759	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.539059823075	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.271863158666	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.287073430473	Right.
0.0	0.185155143227	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.85173621256	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.421500427033	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.273437079485	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.0881120893088	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
1.0	0.558799359062	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.602174104671	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.566122474892	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.380465941885	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.499148892633	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.52904314682	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.585650031547	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.296248192102	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.345623821996	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.168534802007	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.286851189535	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.0676123818173	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.112240413091	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.301532890749	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.261015609795	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.346649474039	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.0935373399459	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.731609141402	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.443690352232	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.590470658589	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.380507750958	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.414634669483	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.25767295793	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.744058197975	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.547994982546	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.688152923209	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.799866105804	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.109051699161	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.420145205759	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.285637519613	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.198020354856	Let me just -- let me respond.
1.0	0.492177282858	They were wrong.
0.0	0.454883039069	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.690881675131	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.648226704297	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.105442899788	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.139838298468	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.710400750605	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.45476077937	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.156881541307	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.222758905643	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.162077425599	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.146491443926	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.32410212375	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.34394964678	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.585020571157	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.383577936248	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.424827556646	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.362641565324	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.120498686763	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.613284682359	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.761040716648	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.355266128012	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.517681740527	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.558313266411	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.411830020651	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.248515775512	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.42866530367	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.334323860473	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.661276581069	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.459984595795	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.440812631984	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.224109410882	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.198231806237	How do I know this?
0.0	0.45280784862	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.394741292747	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
1.0	0.7518231683	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.290860287294	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.250072187759	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.272186076759	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.401318300133	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.131991301383	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.356550481012	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.305624220244	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.243105806384	Yes.
0.0	0.172009424372	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.486626165095	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.232479150188	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.41403675658	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.245559514704	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.51369595311	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.321401026575	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.653362192167	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.390525649279	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.260320188828	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.37993825403	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.147877897899	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.254010774378	He does great.
0.0	0.546858025727	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.261598899044	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.400514103747	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
1.0	0.548901689703	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.189002910113	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.307094198601	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.630241233409	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.192653477623	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.270934028902	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.290046706309	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.698237234863	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.263454891291	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.395128995308	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.421799015226	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.602561114653	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.120004517585	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.24258354705	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.112657725991	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.281783309599	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.352364501349	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.119460636373	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.445754886998	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.291322306825	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.244731290484	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.344175235683	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.354681825598	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.352605871373	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.335552404017	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.941895843713	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.667263224939	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.263623617636	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.426876578421	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.486997236974	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.389204666701	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.30647218612	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.39914547278	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.394226459779	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.413614449353	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.4273663242	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
1.0	0.464251833259	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.280045326722	I love this country.
0.0	0.220214730919	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.441472494412	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.488678608121	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.855422958526	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.337375900238	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.289483484451	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.261768112807	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.443905982823	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.68858511785	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.192916187542	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.813494663784	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.293014551559	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.290984730214	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.69900590739	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.494355797929	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.573555989084	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.313210257257	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.7573720696	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.353506923541	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.304333556537	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.534387409762	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.762531995862	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.626432344332	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.588372609042	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.243105806384	OK?
0.0	0.414595831684	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.432139134768	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.474072268974	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.369154361859	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.355711401135	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.265709471674	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.332150249719	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.243265149792	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.243105806384	OK?
0.0	0.571156576755	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.451187929321	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.556049055062	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.354814020949	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.256537120516	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.0614698859223	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.27919387459	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.269690046251	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.393163670021	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.41526095574	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.117235786132	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.271580255473	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.453291837931	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
1.0	0.966300405633	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0586849779047	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.396904658528	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.942979473109	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.84817420581	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.148386448952	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
1.0	0.703488106472	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.358302433422	I got that.
0.0	0.348623019661	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.522633653095	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.356596063752	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.32470680182	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.145815134792	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.386662065806	You target the bad guys.
1.0	0.517536573388	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.126808653724	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.440936681801	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.613410428368	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.359778755929	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.433150179606	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.332047574683	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.267597464477	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.490651517077	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.215895648971	But look...
0.0	0.325997085541	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.142390226789	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.54002400028	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.675334151348	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.437470847518	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.220692136043	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.313326360945	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.273677660944	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.513055634494	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.15188260928	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.479071320268	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.0582197514475	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.057941687867	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.518019188394	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.37210073818	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.111603293704	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.566774685731	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.354718887624	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.521334901241	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.224839108746	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.392158104314	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.315548792101	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.465156918059	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.602608207714	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.826211923535	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.37192265847	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.304964927525	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.521950408998	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.276938386905	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.217768854958	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
1.0	0.632426592762	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.432566699261	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
1.0	0.275980025083	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.250643883611	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.254977533481	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
1.0	0.584635613022	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.122296081823	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.277520562049	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.297403835561	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.487653405526	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.275939128277	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.468365541938	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.51899365664	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.53131883731	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.345035503416	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.165205877475	(inaudible).
0.0	0.278873573898	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.466303812112	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.0726947396591	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.350455153321	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
1.0	0.448142600726	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.29311778588	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.436979681912	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.113549820061	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.450497928027	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.145265577496	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.308126033136	I have.
0.0	0.407151020951	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.41795116915	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.627007272717	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.772353354705	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.555336430255	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.173642268754	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.434708995771	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.407700218455	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.56473722609	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.2609581934	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.737967387574	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.599335970927	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.274035591686	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.410206282081	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.56660815528	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.626245678699	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.375041200106	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.233786862612	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.580613499619	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.475152729155	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.423533112432	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.335181837084	You're right.
0.0	0.263552135164	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.507727770236	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.271908283495	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.628372796265	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
1.0	0.502645754963	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.534419211733	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.35694097157	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.334290482369	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.560155423971	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.40707382709	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.247568023065	I understand.
0.0	0.361078393481	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.104066605107	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.581676173543	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.159998645499	And...
0.0	0.360182017822	I don't care.
0.0	0.281333167879	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.312103318627	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.33947135266	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.313015384298	The number of women --
0.0	0.540142775466	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.627355290811	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.280853689372	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.439144164413	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.365862940024	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.505187697691	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.412484761639	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.262941127879	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.265551057737	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.243105806384	OK.
0.0	0.449016468276	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.189891820565	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.286444593659	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.254326619478	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.328808993653	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.56281266812	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.223438182463	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.521641704455	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.4573802973	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.623231009368	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.376289540195	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
1.0	0.488213250314	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.379748100887	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.237884009822	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.491244490035	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.461761243676	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.258653555211	Thank you.
0.0	0.416330868512	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.139630908409	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.384268077354	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.277462906332	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.23086293256	The answer is simple.
1.0	0.379240200263	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.523213841551	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.42595807725	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.372016052574	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.658588894084	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.331269625583	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.131638985154	And here's why.
0.0	0.503665461113	It's not supposed to happen that way.
1.0	0.443776181402	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.63671411448	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.373024692309	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.222243192278	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.404958451075	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.277760238539	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.247547483809	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.661432675408	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.762582644975	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.463784622682	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.628429627292	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.245278894727	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.

0.0	0.36157342597	The economy was really booming.
1.0	0.529365511626	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.340584616797	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.700460207358	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.168931575633	It's true.
0.0	0.309941886307	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.324802923158	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.357497908155	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.215066551313	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.580851308054	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.104556989552	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.664880645896	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.866030568239	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.313363358737	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.500144144067	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.

0.0	0.348996704998	It is undermining American democracy.

0.0	0.320782561078	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.

0.0	0.122319224632	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.465070226682	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.266661013364	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.323073110358	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.144241953596	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.318279979703	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.0652646982412	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.437556829716	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.215292603593	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.253921524527	Think about that.
0.0	0.536287522582	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.709718262962	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.322938917135	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.246878242914	...
0.0	0.287458876757	Well, I've been --

0.0	0.346595919671	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.421557057214	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.553085370644	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.252061725081	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.301961660663	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.205867162238	I'll say this.
0.0	0.518281490471	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.696874712881	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.694537196652	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.846245331307	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.72491452134	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.214745550202	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.499783275493	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.244894862299	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.711032520574	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.184782671956	And, folks, we will.

0.0	0.285563972986	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.453121030162	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.616462652389	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.327635235331	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.602417738327	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.561473289264	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.234167029688	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.27555502143	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.40586742814	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.0689889355429	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.87130605117	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.594209048233	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.378689808531	That's what he is.
0.0	0.412371994204	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.372898129431	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.379046787805	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.347923404198	You count on it.
0.0	0.602951690838	It's a problem all over the world.

0.0	0.761148791749	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.50769178815	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.23848487918	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.0289333508269	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.664893337849	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.245241783323	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.310635865339	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
1.0	0.413063559717	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.34060283714	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.255724632388	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.287040348373	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.570361693846	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.144307896491	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.333002706536	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.436525319728	I know every one.
0.0	0.318653557865	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.568373031242	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.12350599704	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.239320255249	Neil...
0.0	0.129739260801	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.503791273855	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.0643668930758	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.506492298534	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.551919358315	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.303914100639	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.25245654781	He undermines it.
0.0	0.308126033136	We do.
0.0	0.192272662677	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.373763222511	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.26590818938	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.413054316908	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.486465986327	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.257117765204	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
1.0	0.817607503096	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.312786071317	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.582891190837	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.324164386536	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.331826412205	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.243105806384	OK.
0.0	0.110003827352	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.287073430473	Right.
0.0	0.162012610258	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.323141881196	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.383035193344	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.419651615018	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.517923017617	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.745322812974	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.302660571975	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.487458012599	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.258653555211	Thank you.
0.0	0.253861139662	No their not.
0.0	0.893709256146	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.449242983601	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.31713817212	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.80046958347	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.489083792144	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.300183107601	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.25403145904	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.645977698235	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.194224197543	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.186303260214	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.75311821926	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.33370240157	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.20789736818	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.138574827249	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.189111386087	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.434906296775	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.307950753865	And you know what?
0.0	0.329156988393	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.235626642924	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.0683162968484	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.292642091613	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.39926350993	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.470712721997	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.555754284254	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.213980440838	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.226528773437	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.528762434764	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.556731071857	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.65166295527	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.301827686701	We have to do something.
0.0	0.165516117959	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.369759255799	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.176655429328	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.415500420796	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.210481636938	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.190675263116	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.0797501073384	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.316830231696	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.290149587179	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.554909948346	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.371408713766	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.323524127716	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.345935469814	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.461689901923	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.382866365536	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.672921074976	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.319435148322	So let's set the facts straight.
1.0	0.668361612058	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.569406659359	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.304595276827	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.364849215835	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.389803247496	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.835026723162	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.217964753305	I think you're --
0.0	0.228618185645	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.258497310089	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.352605871373	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.44438566785	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.687138781736	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.303032207662	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.640549994815	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.606025313903	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.360273825375	But bottom line is: The president is right.
1.0	0.474216017683	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.221670757682	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.397475396929	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.219965665462	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.131819633713	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.355444445063	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.370408110868	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.40904769301	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.432106691935	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.34437751644	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.218722918405	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.626619970541	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.614840024257	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.19819541098	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.449086244821	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.246878242914	...
0.0	0.208637463147	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.323601455585	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.330102086349	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.393125520686	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.673777600295	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.454953570738	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.515824023725	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.179191056342	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.261790522208	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.25832606601	Not bad.
0.0	0.221110671684	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.48614614246	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.420420687993	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.383056560495	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.62889802942	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.258653555211	Thank you.
0.0	0.316153433453	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.432779344984	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.44244309285	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.641228246122	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.364000543624	Maybe you haven't.
1.0	0.534652989159	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.48161987435	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.287292736071	We need sound money.
0.0	0.260187057703	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.232350878615	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.389042314955	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.453262502207	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.435095960591	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.165483638101	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.420177593967	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.232254291631	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.205636276282	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.643440090716	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.128121373579	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.287292736071	We need sound money.
0.0	0.534089115556	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.404462502287	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.464930293388	That's the difference.
0.0	0.422228750287	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.211715988105	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.470224330646	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.4216694721	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.668878843437	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.200528363238	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.164585192521	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.391852336452	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.304020760747	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.340181366436	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.559794115932	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.494630016214	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.466897872674	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.173647445515	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.572463150524	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.608064842405	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.0611379954012	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.240997516387	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.317725485791	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.403898774519	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.533736936608	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.287324012742	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.37995311958	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.635174913885	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.43821361315	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.384159372728	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.122406253176	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.66608811206	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.475372924559	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.300263739904	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.287073430473	Right.
0.0	0.336491176471	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.286641182577	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.20973476275	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.493754082789	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.670602726031	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.49400396587	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.668226658262	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.360528604325	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.371704652014	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.452771854447	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.226605018652	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.792159573223	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.241985339362	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.320387654738	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.505677024821	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.316320572536	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.246335344415	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.694925506396	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.475610868618	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.774164009621	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.184215934371	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.451313756535	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.301039642271	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.161887111964	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.462822927815	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.471241044664	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.274907041331	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.495814952936	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.628409018074	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.317927402445	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.541594631673	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.273159509157	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.271544668761	That will change everything.
0.0	0.346446196389	That's not right.
0.0	0.509109236658	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.309895076628	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.547939250122	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.395121550229	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.199308828359	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.700437847567	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.307950753865	And you know what?
0.0	0.597615352559	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.395398393242	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.432703495834	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.566245648679	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.283616739426	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.449588658568	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.691630425963	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.113619888363	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.490773901881	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.108550613835	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.300335313838	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.281574533145	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.340229049532	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.454041686212	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.359591372305	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.513868669534	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.688250660049	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.366092476408	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.608570597241	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.544265031184	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.363972800886	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.406161471547	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.209510536762	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.264284339692	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.28567617749	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.446050698993	The Emanuel AME church killings.
1.0	0.552359579966	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.421668890191	That is our government today.
0.0	0.2741020055	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.30660057588	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.279047835991	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.29613495168	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.295629762572	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.530114611464	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.263605933314	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.827472257107	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.0890642174178	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.168493502618	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.652817753087	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.364330640312	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.218521075291	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
1.0	0.42789638074	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.157535190635	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.288167194945	I would change them.
0.0	0.651796145441	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.229538091272	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.256625246478	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.317849212661	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.394282987459	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.450553648324	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.610325257269	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.495244773862	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.217615214571	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.234090104456	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.424860953188	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.946581637658	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.

0.0	0.353487300906	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.504189747179	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.307784105941	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.

0.0	0.603405365806	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.362176939868	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.

0.0	0.336600302852	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.427491926051	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.989456372653	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.

1.0	0.802138311622	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.

0.0	0.492088486886	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.

0.0	0.101750243599	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.13911529838	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.674244849752	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.

0.0	0.398119784618	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.45746861443	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.0997435192105	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.252374199856	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.296822538061	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.193118405288	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.18343209577	How great is that?
0.0	0.25652221928	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.674651168948	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.272488498204	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.210178359951	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.574389529528	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.452401607214	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.495232403185	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.519893623748	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.286695840972	No.
0.0	0.854924805154	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.360754554101	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.0963293906567	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.435482346799	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.375853048716	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.579770819568	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.39289693377	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.38420640328	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.31136992036	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.435379199089	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.384738831206	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.336168993278	You have to lead.
0.0	0.773846388892	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.833213977957	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.488898963659	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.471328436308	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.509011662121	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.227298933079	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.479390386724	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.193850442317	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.14444221663	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.481452377593	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.325892498922	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.314294434857	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.406183049661	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.549919888811	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.323771826546	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.35558443826	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.517950512197	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.456223486977	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.908842326127	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.190463335476	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.399161446663	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.538064095528	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.48646954724	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.372193290791	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.663014280344	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.0919087617997	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.414630263682	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.923699211019	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.387128783658	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
1.0	0.74307464191	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.257847138137	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.685035655697	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.848615471056	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.630338113181	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.20635858909	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
1.0	0.731587815428	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.408997735253	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.266770279928	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.256387273193	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.0951622378064	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.532269765882	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.419700282101	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.369409328517	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.520777440369	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.439953309927	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.480201271851	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.422900712336	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.5	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.19977395708	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.811871612175	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.226274080548	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.555726409142	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.242179768926	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.215259021363	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.351457895345	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.671980380428	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.45741937358	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.36253033533	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.414408740576	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.528452767352	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.378795184601	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.506278384144	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.459090137234	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.41728662924	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.

0.0	0.911183900795	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.247219912216	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.290830721153	I totally get that.
0.0	0.537135644754	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.113129728667	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.370810855844	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.196122620811	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.605330844905	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.209444671798	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.319164138572	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
1.0	0.781198541661	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.748414025703	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.239756923753	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.534794072405	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.669027703765	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.344123070919	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.496375316534	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.400901734564	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.40731434127	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.425348180517	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.211604156757	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.676620286322	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.785471757986	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.30613107664	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.481483510232	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.37303522851	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.0680537668388	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.334148917697	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.708561254219	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.430490761864	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.31409862786	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.402224718064	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.319429453403	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.44338301183	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.533679682228	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.251087358974	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.283012542628	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.566239887672	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.495171834128	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.417287617668	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.261125877993	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.587337418996	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.568077746752	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.332594750695	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.678533397731	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.506691651541	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.306225031661	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.802761648026	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.134479410514	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.364454451394	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.553389345167	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.330212061421	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.195928266081	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.109175719344	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.836356634427	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.466176766487	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.313856548699	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.603868779041	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.201956572396	Wait for what?
0.0	0.608835256154	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.42344754451	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.394756080584	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.230917124985	Our next president...
0.0	0.249946035834	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.335181837084	You're right.
0.0	0.474438126023	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.16881347295	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.085775390887	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.657558752855	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.522478725307	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.337421996421	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.624021863925	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.107590153732	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.174577563867	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
1.0	0.567161172337	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.834227974789	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.259433364678	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.205722165725	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.362614286114	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.445719056347	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.290653569535	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.402023765722	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.190515714114	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.490614496144	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.584167699708	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.209143426426	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.362105493056	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.349679542742	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.268852310267	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.22651076974	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.705515075299	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.433557903041	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.0894711938356	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.317528251831	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.101852000592	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.913205593117	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.322377818774	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.441700465889	That's fine.
0.0	0.402496653335	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.209314396195	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.0650933789314	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.536971207325	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.461341687172	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.420787242331	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.313550740049	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.26268643963	You can have him.
0.0	0.56058095835	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.316549335825	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.24624574541	Check it out.
0.0	0.576609871602	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.540509068358	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.694275267213	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.31846722607	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.0555862143053	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.232818760903	Illegal.
0.0	0.246878242914	...
0.0	0.314273095574	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.79852092738	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.715468212973	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.618978293713	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.136714904395	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.627856521413	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.243632947802	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.646493199513	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.64095457225	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.177304285137	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.672177409154	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.784566524444	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.348394161002	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.327084011111	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.298527059418	I promise.
0.0	0.246930383401	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.45576962895	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.407405298739	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.601930684005	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.531634237467	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.309155232449	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.459650598457	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.575425640918	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.426750893705	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.31818841357	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.119842709569	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.626046996163	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.694428949904	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.286307097972	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.625564290841	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.774023583762	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.0975205966639	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.263605933314	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.297062994622	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.304346291262	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.492825233806	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.541028764762	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.252787092235	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.24024777775	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.691211479308	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.135224402969	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.223637820026	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.276054729773	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.37501438885	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.296733480287	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.587600835553	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.512572674658	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.69448863145	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.217035174321	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.516907781369	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.273905803816	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.530406929416	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.405681715947	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.227274627893	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.345147706705	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.173497799553	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.278305226054	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.317453104038	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.394137779691	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.200847620663	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.243900124641	in particular.
0.0	0.388662428875	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.0999700129858	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.277344097731	slot.
0.0	0.179396376382	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
1.0	0.453030511356	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.405453470748	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.418235357833	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.410084135899	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.810405630751	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.668476044359	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.302518614826	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.229721176704	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.266273800955	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.

0.0	0.607052137742	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.913950039284	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.

0.0	0.326214983878	That is beyond unspeakable.

0.0	0.438749905389	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.408296285621	I never said that.

0.0	0.558779857489	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.350891342279	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.473181186448	Here's the way you need to deal with it.

0.0	0.517707435165	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.218450246405	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.4239608792	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.398009583729	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.70323805195	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.818935470905	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.373946529324	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.544095985044	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.0955569515317	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.401432561808	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.351186797585	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.406551592594	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.300511480071	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.138035954632	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.377948685147	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.435909687563	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.379489537531	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.389236736902	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.479736786824	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.

0.0	0.272998615218	So we have a disagreement on this.
1.0	0.794639728365	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.472588497419	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.23673475302	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.506604362444	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.614269920483	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.306142860505	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.290928570843	John.

0.0	0.298049204462	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.52302558063	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.131220128829	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.151113606513	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.307792343354	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.450511165846	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.752160079236	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.226189765052	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.289013148264	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.453511236995	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.499846733268	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
1.0	0.775405372158	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.388906265252	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.327271965401	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.402597667574	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.363740900528	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.207286288954	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.611573206652	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.164822998283	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.17365753775	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.369692448819	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.451157817785	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
1.0	0.724515650319	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.450251724091	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.25362210561	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.246921140884	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.391468900656	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.306216173457	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.243279923989	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.267695884915	I love China.
0.0	0.333894748419	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.0716058849747	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.400068993924	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.232564717674	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.362147502227	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.564868513597	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.392218017618	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.274647356726	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.370851314366	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.109842401017	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.867650187567	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.277966887267	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.540721992396	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.302545496292	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.478470905709	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.694690399158	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.256337695255	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.547527864303	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.557154080008	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.686303904579	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.506052399679	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.168375032202	No, it's true.
0.0	0.134506234261	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.437194497053	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
1.0	0.816672394248	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.35134817408	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.537698865021	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.205597140853	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
1.0	0.399940195349	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.10766035966	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
1.0	0.387709674297	That's wrong.
0.0	0.684743148818	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.864956263002	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.293959964762	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.305271970215	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.0744980933693	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.466692949677	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.32584189166	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.318003124269	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.329201744462	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.60898585809	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.800812644118	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.286998837115	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.414309514577	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.467109713851	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.435406896987	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.370857132398	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.236939433982	And for good cause.
0.0	0.260825955517	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.34621168609	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.470150899734	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.565860518052	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.134395759626	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.456225591434	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.261163175189	You know why?
0.0	0.278970412673	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.169213941421	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.249356133837	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.319606828978	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.322250691506	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.47404843512	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.530942689522	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.679685583119	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.268691426385	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.344609675534	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.152768069674	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.598101429162	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.443639578167	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.699568718475	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.240731410957	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.48087390298	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.263084091661	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
1.0	0.821149810978	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.411856179797	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.405807167543	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.391074153781	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
1.0	0.50928335576	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
1.0	0.173530315787	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.362634880305	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.238843019368	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.684257323249	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.639243681736	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.51573882524	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.406610843328	You did.
0.0	0.0576560305242	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.423889995674	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.425538925598	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.335114462938	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.594235005378	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.598563876616	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.6667397864	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.425867337315	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.383549994454	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.89653356693	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.496790144767	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.77559502362	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.429088003082	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.351211689395	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.286810745526	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.401711857544	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.188559244235	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.275221989108	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.244251058736	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.476499004484	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.383422613329	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.467128875208	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.114108923427	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.363285979882	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.287073430473	Dynamically.
0.0	0.346446196389	That is not right.
0.0	0.430162984945	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.38303974058	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.550789642115	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.389478308064	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.26099326088	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.593696798549	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.498705838357	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.722065000171	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.396017168932	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.0592790316152	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.755700784772	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.307950753865	And you know what?
0.0	0.224079482205	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.177480044856	...John...
0.0	0.620552398988	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.258653555211	Thank you.
0.0	0.286695840972	No.
0.0	0.132292923675	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.449272099344	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.10598074194	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.67123184691	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.25677736025	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.465369080148	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.386910419331	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.508756593678	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.302787321009	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.549476289233	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.468903091315	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.34645552353	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.234246477222	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.264449329625	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.787394550383	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.229031525347	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.433889667749	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.408296285621	I never said that.
0.0	0.241187643817	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.49688311425	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.424227508357	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.247330625789	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.835081851476	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.51143706575	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.204473399372	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.354563496755	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.382912848053	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.427438983728	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.236295879476	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.111908278755	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.406788975015	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.621349227861	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.466026411716	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.328345812728	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.16854908978	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.289361373274	No, John.
0.0	0.312757568993	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.578787156422	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.30485265453	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.60774117634	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.790235143807	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.392262891824	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.440361263886	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.395985086258	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.357445930129	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.658548500715	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.168892493498	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.40560717142	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.675761758962	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.51042312809	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.326730422011	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.265988516993	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.570863222175	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.309345107168	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.199276618006	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.21459373674	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.231285221398	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.553170944464	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.214338010787	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.503852857229	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.522735271861	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.106903202115	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.176897650305	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.151399208686	And why?
0.0	0.124070657949	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.45914430688	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.308256400505	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.31059091303	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.514128547691	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.608224887466	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.366896227238	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.387729687221	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.459686316169	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.51018436166	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.692491668368	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.390081897692	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.344234340469	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.2227212346	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.517682141384	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.59567051402	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.698867786058	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.398315100462	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.290380920279	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.457468884124	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.322796938545	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.577272513957	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.580766152974	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.285886297487	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.639873884169	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.309909127477	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.414057532013	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.745388472716	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.225616684202	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.362288969566	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.442479400498	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.346446196389	That's not right.
0.0	0.863607137844	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.287073430473	Right.
0.0	0.247473449567	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.569147398144	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.271851562517	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.322521920855	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.219793972807	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.318442442635	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.32082267441	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.248698875011	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.457002561083	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.772721326798	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.268798293669	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.304367716492	I've laid out...
0.0	0.208299995116	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.384144281395	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.12640459589	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.146995175327	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.374402916778	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.467646321485	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
1.0	0.510028177333	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.256249929999	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.258653555211	Thank you.
0.0	0.704810324228	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.290141204068	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.298640730597	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.376221718462	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.365893487612	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.482830957044	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.602613120064	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.366470521022	We are not France.
0.0	0.481090345321	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.767118945472	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
1.0	0.246816116875	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.367454818072	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.154216263453	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.270953259079	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.459322151469	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.484135148934	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.457554241618	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.399556228851	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.287073430473	Right.
0.0	0.143081302967	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.324685129769	I would change them.
0.0	0.167200304173	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.937011558925	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.79228966483	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.381124913571	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.162012610258	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.633618174531	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.356408494539	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.548302828579	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.161327820035	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.261125877993	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.218625592139	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.336819964562	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.496832423565	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.362566930726	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.223741426154	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.50763267031	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.471035486437	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.446911222627	He is a good man.
0.0	0.104636227974	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.303543353295	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.566204769053	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.491196271095	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.500562648823	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.469413359511	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.313318124065	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.439347846898	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.173026152686	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.364666796719	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
1.0	0.461375802121	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.60583710369	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.216715125156	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.302026014729	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.535866061649	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.34917057374	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
1.0	0.397203284336	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.785581699971	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.382659426281	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.33028248428	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.54482422778	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.259981669805	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.189332281945	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.527787592134	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.419118551369	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.284161976468	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.217483152061	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
1.0	0.362374184696	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.301655888327	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.533138802931	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.725615234248	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
1.0	0.827937390037	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.387984464855	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.415936407103	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.255041442657	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.623544957179	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.243105806384	OK?
0.0	0.46428100204	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.654462218781	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.661891150834	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.215272169322	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.279669617565	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.461884894995	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.403823431882	What have you got now?
