0.0	0.405661955217	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
1.0	0.959249004056	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.68586608217	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.4595414864	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.168229863383	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.458548536901	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.424928341409	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.510853065058	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.43952106607	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.5	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.509206969104	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.490768118969	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.823976537886	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.5	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.431348797952	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.437683357892	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.531077675085	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.426885657242	And God bless America.
0.0	0.551546284252	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.155769877531	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.3807634344	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.737469919263	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.432992805382	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.598536651156	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.567740235611	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.426791319288	Thank you.
0.0	0.456388532147	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.444847195461	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.433599352746	You looking at me?
0.0	0.439066828824	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.459343830969	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.442394931058	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.536157090407	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.0418099019793	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.426626196907	He undermines it.
0.0	0.459954391538	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.579628614343	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.380985079974	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.35309014775	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.420384853724	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.41749187406	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.470802656613	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.465319363135	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.491786710071	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.467903593962	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.436471678754	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.441324686433	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.441214972531	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.464720666463	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.428133795644	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.42849823217	About Medicare?
0.0	0.426036761363	No -- no...
0.0	0.427404288904	We don't win.
0.0	0.5	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.668846497545	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.440772836188	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.476061449052	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.472951900563	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.462956232642	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.438297332802	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.408275009302	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.464242737253	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.641109322503	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.428216197743	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.436617251075	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.483647339021	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.976621296286	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.426959093553	No.
0.0	0.749909954912	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.47848960729	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.443851300892	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.575832112451	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.466690147768	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.588647649924	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.460950949852	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.468286226116	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.425054757418	...Chris...
0.0	0.433717212823	That's not true.
0.0	0.452067144592	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.103545268458	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.426531314469	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.862099936373	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.426364020596	Yeah.
0.0	0.425919326932	These...
0.0	0.440083722255	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.437701512034	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.414345840856	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.758398244841	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.446146148134	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.999987480215	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.426364020596	OK.
0.0	0.487638806708	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.441395356944	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.564848544127	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.454573454398	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.423177939851	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.281087834864	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.5	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.431664560893	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.473637778989	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.475397984149	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.458566326107	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.416239739628	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.430441090674	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.459445189496	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.391859207032	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.475685380892	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.549225821663	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.999999998978	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.248479495269	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.456959476547	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.460650633208	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.0163647628012	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.426713206982	John.
0.0	0.13940693439	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.425129887729	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.0430834981495	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.432309498543	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.462630615031	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.468967703911	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.441073468336	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.396518861113	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.453245889192	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.436189641763	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.399034079349	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.428196922827	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.442335279049	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.439608869875	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.44612047385	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.423174097903	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.613856047919	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.158405981597	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.475288666467	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.433757437641	He was on the board.
0.0	0.403957042371	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
1.0	0.767934895752	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.357247405245	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	9.30700595082e-05	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.0906234945098	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.510704554061	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.444862065518	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.435410434307	My background is different.
0.0	0.473014149388	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.0349794694302	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.172704014253	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.479690420973	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.443083050361	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.473839069115	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.43142713146	We have to do something.
0.0	0.473859951365	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.449288233176	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.454246615203	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.436351494967	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.429788084954	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.429784847371	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.264495817317	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.361726337758	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.358409212096	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.226789568376	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.42169879665	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.446982201668	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.43132973161	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
1.0	0.426027011185	That's wrong.
0.0	0.467922839878	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.539450013816	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.43661302739	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.434790054648	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.550201380101	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.590337354838	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.519650337779	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.538412405853	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.437955277064	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.428872129192	We need sound money.
0.0	0.428555443537	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.433532547284	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.398968859017	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.44059909213	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.426677586137	Illegal.
0.0	0.0983132294937	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.44196208909	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.187979813569	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.431548700207	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.38029633904	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.422819272837	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.515540198744	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.592188865485	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.410787294955	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.439526706319	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.438382829499	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.395111706364	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.429936142483	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.516976828435	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.414946165647	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.10600329131	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.30893085472	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.486177838405	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.454359078096	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.625738569116	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.699041747999	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.444493189113	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.426495383302	Right.
0.0	0.529315589592	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.175086706012	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.309661228246	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.518115226762	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.590420812469	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.4227824653	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.615683386325	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.44328265121	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.464459369988	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.435413386122	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.486791119917	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
1.0	0.92786038698	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.422448946815	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.466270398714	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.511136746948	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.436578931519	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.536171097258	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
1.0	0.552013972619	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.742150104996	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.271202658941	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.451773644836	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.592703438099	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.425216235325	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.448943970815	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.429325529887	He's wrong.
0.0	0.307486833616	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.452671734967	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
1.0	0.480587705179	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.426478500455	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
1.0	0.645011439015	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.444712534313	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.488913434961	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.390111046958	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.291618696983	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.435150206711	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.374782773787	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.431171242032	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.349526416303	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.513297171733	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.0114294766306	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.600317977605	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.440396948373	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.47472974441	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.444241681996	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.981978505037	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.421412225201	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.434824263471	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.435381381291	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.545931817982	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.536325781775	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.459915817795	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.463005673167	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.460623050482	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.392221857674	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.444192096694	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.0922564015588	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.00565356347898	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
1.0	0.456346757513	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.417463146427	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.43177660212	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.441650901334	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.469605569352	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.573717201652	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.431313004908	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.433345099505	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.43777951887	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.436890900436	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.475738625612	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.567867998127	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.558165041241	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.424817730635	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.56674999017	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.492386237101	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.526495131957	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.519493074481	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.425554950723	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.567576361588	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.466646440855	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.471682350742	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.67796496459	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.0240113211563	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.803637049219	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.481112913741	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
1.0	0.549096805192	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.592087857279	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.441402019968	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.686167929549	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.448089029019	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
1.0	0.809337417784	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.426330750236	I totally get that.
0.0	0.443793513787	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.422442037932	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.42326713543	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.429916944933	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.427118814388	Check it out.
0.0	0.51749566661	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.5	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.431912310796	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.443810013027	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.399365640012	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.446593464599	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.648939920288	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.436379460592	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.439463253259	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.345977236677	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.483096236502	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.428670846553	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.437330280288	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.433929263047	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.460971442356	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.508335809636	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.439171384829	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.432987887114	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.659432408521	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.420218126291	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.359244381805	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.530312754955	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.522674411215	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.433348994574	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.429326674966	And, we said no.
0.0	0.4620526283	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.5	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.594060143898	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.422707648159	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.474677235617	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.482062584917	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.430792194326	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.42874248145	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.478021481147	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.462419618432	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.44461392366	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.438623637614	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.433641604344	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.417348356804	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.600603123726	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.63281157745	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.426959093553	No.
0.0	0.444234730066	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.5	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.484500921281	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.445501728636	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.458323055698	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.447014515016	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.443356704096	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.43308430353	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.427097729813	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.557972305297	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.463737902235	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.486928742342	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.46556110485	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.43612001697	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.377898937301	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.442108793318	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.446475777555	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.473429564212	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.485906397352	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
1.0	0.821125480235	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.994106045238	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.471293090173	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.363764560913	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.235976092393	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.453901922091	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.5	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.35225550177	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.425067879779	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.446359381348	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.454698341523	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.5	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.431575401333	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.579614522737	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.387144886658	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.569973197591	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.410463908978	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.433200075329	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.517789372205	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.430573366761	I don't care.
0.0	0.5	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.613907749774	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.392800977913	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.594301983619	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.479948784102	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.426863885606	You're welcome.
0.0	0.426931084253	I have.
0.0	0.425066834876	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.435229766559	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.447947193413	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.258488377445	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.432828685008	Good at email.
0.0	0.454818447847	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.431215637539	But I want to go further.

0.0	0.443950525728	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.479682891989	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.

0.0	0.477250559136	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.429551735692	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.

0.0	0.444345726944	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.489324451889	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.

0.0	0.430859377401	I'm aware of that.

1.0	0.994510704515	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.439530607302	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.431714579096	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.443940532565	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.43186486516	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.44194343282	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.429825349913	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.447831854328	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.781188927549	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.466263480202	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.670462442751	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.591792554058	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.511527171151	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.416420271657	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.455832463407	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.42376452654	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.491581637709	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.00126513076454	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.479781847569	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.439112413658	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.461186275862	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.840536359855	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.426791319288	Thank you.
0.0	0.0292879882521	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.472874313047	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.426495383302	Absolutely.
0.0	0.561686865934	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.451311583063	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.449951631101	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.32073098076	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.451029484882	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.440819474001	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.547051151308	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.5	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.731774228072	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.430357968411	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.585031576769	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.430398812583	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.430869663707	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.987962049154	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.407573201145	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.999999399053	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.649400384235	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.451503418034	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.468054001646	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.25793769026	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.469346711521	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.38146380021	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.594036480217	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.442565321076	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.459957441052	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.443762442695	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.472481894044	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.418214069671	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.435617391595	That's an interesting question.

0.0	0.474518835855	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.412805057216	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.689526576043	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.

0.0	0.43463537753	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.419993191898	In all due respect...
0.0	0.730393099807	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.433763422206	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.462151279333	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.

0.0	0.999992116164	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.577337464239	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.452194330107	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.433763422206	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.426626848518	I promise.
0.0	0.628584614989	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.438665491328	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.439794907419	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.290856113298	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
1.0	0.476366884396	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.

0.0	0.537122598326	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.3807634344	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.420810856928	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.433778180678	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.483826522967	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.

0.0	0.452382445513	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.433200108862	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.414676624597	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.

0.0	0.455221674539	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.433382225011	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.449744717887	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.452706772551	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.459399529546	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.4335296578	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.438470170887	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.4346861505	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.419483319034	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.455024192735	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.

0.0	0.330238814413	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.507545422372	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.453088984124	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.475607988372	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.597091743457	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.5	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.0037429500228	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.450576698689	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.478821626625	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.426495383302	Dynamically.
0.0	0.441209771464	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.536023697176	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.

1.0	0.0344382117019	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.438297332802	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.419102384716	And that doesn't have to be true.

0.0	0.512043326141	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.

0.0	0.610143997105	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.426016170595	And so do I.
0.0	0.431455023734	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.435669443039	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.00556445830867	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.205822623185	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.544722023343	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.431306222822	It's a joke.
0.0	0.510140575449	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.42217865105	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.432526473396	But I would add this.
0.0	0.623538789896	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.217859344779	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.478632559537	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.973218320277	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
1.0	0.559083087689	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.426495383302	Right.
0.0	0.59281147877	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.475158509819	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.44535790834	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.43653491196	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.450019924472	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.436471824546	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.449151817338	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.435372471561	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.627881901586	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.429280758751	We need security.
0.0	0.549814189276	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.

0.0	0.197652813744	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.653286041702	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.505929114694	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.426364020596	OK?
0.0	0.537329955086	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.454252427419	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.43679825641	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.582442197637	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
1.0	0.435916012644	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.374782773787	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.572580924449	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.428754522946	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.428408268411	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.406146324517	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...

0.0	0.462080802431	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.444222673135	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.0725131000482	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.448971403687	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.336325439383	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.59678872919	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.474544385341	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.432283124988	The time to act is now.
1.0	0.517603858637	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.436499151136	Enough on fantasy football.
1.0	0.429693682959	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.439340012327	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.529161632428	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.436217595997	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.479056306603	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.48765304279	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.470859881192	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.464897260387	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.451277351553	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.542200059345	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.478542922617	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.450352854359	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.970264378911	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.309170318406	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.5	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.460187065833	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.480797068942	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.44401299543	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.61271612709	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.386019389721	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.42886882631	It never happens.
0.0	0.508933387067	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.410606414666	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.464744623287	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.214135902298	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.384232279361	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.454362641488	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.454798007037	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.565013763275	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.42585015132	...
0.0	0.425144266613	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.434093426399	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.522512133401	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.378801441773	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.477442101244	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.420952427188	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.470943558195	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.453300446228	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.963041016586	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.45888700393	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
1.0	0.492046225222	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
1.0	0.783781278376	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.42949421095	Or somebody else.

0.0	0.433219747224	You're simply not.
0.0	0.476539144564	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.92095256731	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.5	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.434704879571	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.426495383302	Right.
0.0	0.419366938909	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.470564437791	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.434282069087	I was the architect.
0.0	0.434041085925	I would change them.
0.0	0.462597395006	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.5	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.0118310328584	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.643868019201	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
1.0	0.445038120118	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.489155446538	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.134957077402	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.454998480809	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.433256162085	She voted for it.
0.0	0.421199479508	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.452057073871	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.437219812825	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.653047277076	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.439624444889	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.420464598551	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.460175085429	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.461833160486	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.428668107094	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.

0.0	0.49180926844	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.0670676097468	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.465905296916	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.33819718374	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.447149199135	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.44399277797	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.430879960534	I'm prepared.
0.0	1.00000009947e-07	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.439046595241	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.545018008111	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.594908258151	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?

0.0	0.476643997233	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.430163975892	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.293404858277	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.306539465914	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.444590633026	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.456382408438	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.428920659731	Why is that?
0.0	0.423246497029	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.431884160951	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.431975221468	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.433783646453	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.436699575725	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.429701069089	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.433921547082	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.432603624362	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.430053032441	That is important.
0.0	0.278921728078	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.442195015139	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.437741082811	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.436347925246	That's my bill.
0.0	0.422008903087	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.422137715541	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.471951202808	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.287926658159	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
1.0	0.533141262327	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.441311412409	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.420626615257	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.431370303472	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.65969417425	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.00327016514824	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.528250353674	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.448569199795	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.536842263569	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.301011256586	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.430903736835	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.674049898053	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.332470239887	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.788133590592	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.505482814687	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.433788465421	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.488841975288	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.405087801025	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.473999602052	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.

0.0	0.444438125257	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.427303349007	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.599774367078	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.461761008638	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.476070718966	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.434775944027	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.464898819878	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.642992209618	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.561972497364	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.441308935818	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.533247673193	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.431207525872	They're off to China.
0.0	0.426791319288	Thank you.
0.0	0.428569778944	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.379298119817	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.42836170678	We're running.
0.0	0.438516606207	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.549293444381	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.437090733635	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.422715376731	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.48238266057	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.44410792399	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.297067898932	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.214614145609	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.455635517394	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.444511448797	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.388341522046	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.45996805829	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.584695862774	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.442050625016	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.371325643347	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.353002855376	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.510205741254	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.423706851007	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.455300315978	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.443515250757	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.5	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.428311287546	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.485428382165	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.647756524048	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.212517964887	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.432411368459	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.458646819888	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.508846098806	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.478077494535	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.414350538384	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.426318998733	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.688530097392	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.157530116476	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.429664115992	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.374249942401	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.444115027226	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.353094994759	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.458579012693	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.613746720182	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.441953384508	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.432825481661	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.441498003057	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.423603736312	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.471471994919	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.85147432999	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.412380080169	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.431639331947	I never said that.
0.0	0.429394609669	He has never defended...
0.0	0.430861863906	I will not do that.
0.0	0.509990639877	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.429762405791	Think about that.
0.0	0.526191817235	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.464243450105	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.0221055822968	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.520628851335	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.549066397009	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.433489014686	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.454044787069	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.462003121755	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.402989281797	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.426150039703	And here's why.
0.0	0.573707833627	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.829539916295	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.425601434613	So...
0.0	0.451421354982	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.392383366648	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.55204907478	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.482212956963	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.685956237305	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.705203899435	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.406890945266	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.445154162552	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.5	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.447161712564	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.461219475647	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.409805111937	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.386540082844	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.438584488575	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.429923238002	I got that.
0.0	0.641908522924	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.5	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
1.0	0.713247308538	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.461050476878	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.788852658383	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.467229841301	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.419243809476	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.571231997342	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.481580501096	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.678368674449	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.5	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.434596081848	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.429436481703	How about this?
0.0	0.595185287185	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.999999758079	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.426466478282	Why?
0.0	0.520704461272	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.421570199378	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.438588485971	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.424586508229	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.400576450877	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.517546211407	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.472656964869	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.468008293219	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.426932328479	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.463696135682	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
1.0	0.519027771942	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.472748025295	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.5	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
1.0	0.510285637745	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.776612145233	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.432881566208	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.417950564055	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.387325528127	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.56812756933	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.470899002161	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.458776567765	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.461605697802	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.442921613453	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.727082453466	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.48736541651	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.449261130035	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.42585015132	...
0.0	0.429108607644	And you know what?
0.0	0.439640951973	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.373971697233	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.651785443904	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.429108607644	And you know what?
0.0	0.438574248154	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.467707124366	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.431145802695	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.478140780952	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.437785631827	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.615938577117	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.419327160976	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.423239874489	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.426495383302	Absolutely.
0.0	0.437378323373	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.478861114602	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.408468839507	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.429982248548	It's not working.
0.0	0.688357628745	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.875250748726	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.548026878425	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.0289278654903	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.471504294362	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.468109906259	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.147806884151	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.459857052717	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.425054757418	...Chris...
0.0	0.754268880771	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.425754669274	Maria...
0.0	0.183697611739	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.51724607124	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.541622819712	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.452839204414	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
1.0	0.459614893987	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.538445915411	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.43016437499	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.275250074183	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.375014117865	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.428805170464	I didn't.
0.0	0.5	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.410180226304	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.348700619991	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.365107916968	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.432002274669	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.308244199473	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.629539763335	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.267365137159	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.332013324838	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.447094406234	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
1.0	0.0598862751207	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.524371298737	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.292233367652	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.521241573447	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.436768862078	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.443156429021	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.458041652681	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.441321756876	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.4321263501	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.61041263604	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.512194300716	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.439131089977	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.434592568326	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.459295105785	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.511018297035	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.702966049548	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.429725875657	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.451802051949	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.70090418954	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.432353303391	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.433531657346	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.0959869391046	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.443085522103	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.414169281493	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.441114982071	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.473896670891	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.42079672464	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.43396059887	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.433760080486	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.483634272926	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.463595305091	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.607012785125	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.222988076966	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.145734785373	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.5	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.5	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.468082122847	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.5	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.453978315528	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.42607401798	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
1.0	0.708181417698	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.445066986463	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.430651068967	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.436952292542	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.717319088177	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.442389451517	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.331072138176	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.510321222848	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.426536801066	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.516273657433	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.355565786084	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.751941032776	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.433638854262	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.429805032872	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.441531404726	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.429875582649	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.530516978459	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.429387531576	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.436537979721	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.436671781605	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.299992071666	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.160538099462	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.355109697191	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.692689779207	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.425054757418	...John...
0.0	0.746993171748	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.885947251996	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.5	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.44942332442	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.70196223176	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.475897651468	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.428048299905	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.468813662074	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.428370291239	You count on it.
0.0	0.452571231308	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.433409110614	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.525122007282	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.511419319062	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.436361468711	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.452024283266	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.431421278259	A brief response.
0.0	0.432796192451	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.441650371618	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.433559776076	The answer is no.
0.0	0.414641067851	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.492343776306	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.564016610694	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.44902483778	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.435863936158	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.206502623306	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.473292514127	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.567638501567	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.461438228262	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.428872129192	We need sound money.
0.0	0.507891412579	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.483987540541	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.520877867984	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.434364833542	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.0476421892631	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.438424630858	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.507530069959	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.363183990424	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.911535307443	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.427488661617	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.451315629987	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.451909177863	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.435744698108	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.470343291439	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.193592359878	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.579233577669	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.476985688072	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.431224858826	So you might not.
0.0	0.5	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.43508941126	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.485600277456	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.506841899846	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.676020010179	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.475891181376	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.611821776153	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.455961601172	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.49373921544	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.5	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.426495383302	Right.
0.0	0.428007650238	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.5	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.432638331337	That's fine.
0.0	0.668986269134	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.431069712607	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.472714482678	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.430078910705	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.437565682841	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.448918801957	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.539014857694	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.428552871829	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.431056750375	No, you did.
0.0	0.51011857825	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.242532471587	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.744673321689	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.435652712102	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.523530661641	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.486586725505	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.419627113001	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.427414463437	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.357469464146	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.405870071364	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.613168551473	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.429269639116	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.426791319288	Thank you.
0.0	0.547687346724	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.488792374432	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.42468701253	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.412548593884	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.436791689716	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.436614129458	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.445549628454	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.439167352977	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.463647194599	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.44222157254	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.448723920265	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.00927381745347	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.00315886784334	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.487009424362	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.447863117341	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.449534654824	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.450057248555	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
1.0	0.675039321944	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.436279622721	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.483818233648	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.429598740835	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.431884073753	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.455781106147	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.428325816858	Think about it.
0.0	0.43742475787	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.431112167564	That's what we need.
0.0	0.563224342004	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.492228897564	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.44461116736	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.456295489444	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.241770856562	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.433069971086	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.010303444002	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.446962460016	Every election we talk about this.

0.0	0.444066403137	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.411554290415	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
1.0	0.214633589528	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.443589987822	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.459758831302	Where did that spirit come from in America?
1.0	0.648083392515	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.169126996262	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.473975358259	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.486676625925	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.493479388263	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.512038181226	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.345539242812	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.492233597389	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.248994989857	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.448496034033	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.455661212354	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.438375559693	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.360563926221	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.

0.0	0.464314567313	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.538610811648	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.577699059135	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.43137758105	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.431604594988	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.446565815365	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.481955577662	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.430505754254	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.431728941174	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.427436815877	This will end.
0.0	0.431429135606	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.507327830295	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.425887139434	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.611180656411	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.430312582449	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.284771796952	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.493655182816	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.429852479256	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.44004989533	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.386649967326	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.329482953369	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.457527797675	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.482552520884	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.593189030623	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.439549438261	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.412505575403	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.698552433938	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.444255175367	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.441518452658	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.822327859489	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.469933609503	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.402287164776	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.434045263662	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
1.0	0.428827050282	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.461167439594	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.556920617849	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.511965763649	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.440880796609	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.157743827933	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.191029534169	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.75864325099	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.798386745886	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.509498031936	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.463570603128	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.00140662486546	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.413534416596	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.566088935519	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.470209091319	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.64952539255	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.5	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.444543523228	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.606337692089	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.936619214646	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.00201485181977	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
1.0	0.530739301134	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.459842465879	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.816347984385	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.602925590064	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.448013613253	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.4747511225	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.725709476999	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.432608492358	This is the same old stuff since I left.
1.0	0.450147428765	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.688531126741	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.713326661211	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.452918278904	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.438851835068	That's what I said.
0.0	0.536576953555	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.447612962392	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.60135276268	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
1.0	0.620669972567	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.467124840483	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.437700072527	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.429284314469	I can do that.
0.0	0.383952484923	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.563087883927	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.229925928271	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.64640131725	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.408299616074	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.477810204929	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.444720191147	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.523095279988	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.437878320047	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.118703859364	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.247506241769	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.632867774529	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.430113954036	We are not France.
0.0	0.407225447338	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.47423245318	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.614178780918	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.467751697854	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.428007650238	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.541658979646	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.483632264403	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.299786155485	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.428477145681	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.422721477638	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	8.99748126105e-05	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.450279331247	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.802479111356	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.425245304022	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.648125440214	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."

0.0	0.551280320408	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.

0.0	0.429656209311	You know why three?
0.0	0.466693790343	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.

0.0	0.443115380201	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.44994743376	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.417467000676	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.442086265241	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.473298952264	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.470501855887	We would still have racism holding people back.
1.0	0.449492077113	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.999999875358	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.509877274509	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.459740737367	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.425806575071	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.421966467665	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.443132945842	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.20382952545	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.467136207152	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.439513152371	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.420672967614	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.45426004106	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.587746113578	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.426184747601	See?
0.0	0.444670551174	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.439377678727	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.525426228203	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.430587547663	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.567690315747	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	1.0	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.0042909582787	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.453651677059	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.457218255125	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.527028990182	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.407510468111	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.476855857665	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.732466840181	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.704000077132	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.439384796802	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.42257885518	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.788731905281	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.529245400801	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
1.0	0.512617798615	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.663717168354	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.000461415966573	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.428394690243	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.444366324956	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.429976074753	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.421067637964	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.434213126241	That's the difference.
0.0	0.0410067015302	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.432249791973	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.431375920602	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.427716977745	Well, sure.
1.0	0.744503969669	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
1.0	0.458680340723	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.456191811019	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.00438797588721	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.595601861794	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.42054932698	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.464214776777	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.430513838191	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.46729529933	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.537950853632	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.597240923781	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.597887858701	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.422833029898	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.438400168083	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.43253674694	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.455659205719	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.424405607158	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.372789070321	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.426610906254	Came out great.
0.0	0.519497036096	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.441964407984	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.419328693671	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.429792590058	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.45601943883	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.429214463707	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.448252007157	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.437676891091	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.44982446045	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.427333927746	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.490239192028	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.585493878962	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.361631660859	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.44762441293	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.459794941204	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.569473246637	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.416870546288	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.0553566645261	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.65239624592	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
1.0	0.429641871445	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.365328672706	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.506794640222	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.463235328144	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.355483760806	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.0457896305136	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.426954034163	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.000989892831635	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.477039244964	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.481391016529	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.660775110081	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.721232150117	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
1.0	0.454992865809	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.422574302166	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.493755688752	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.204252678731	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.370522037572	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.413652826917	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.439487509615	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.49309821568	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
1.0	0.483293994096	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.434853758109	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.015872842991	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.426495383302	Right.
0.0	0.481534036651	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.186438994097	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.852734388046	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.449233228492	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.442688618518	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.408711647807	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.427597231541	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.438626849301	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.435415087141	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.5	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.105069091179	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.427395485833	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.511460753253	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.584464622388	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.429055298406	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.432874546377	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.417440565825	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.45034096223	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.455911245826	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.586960388634	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.609242707245	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.429301993399	...before I go.
0.0	0.427706336571	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.470090725726	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.387855326744	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.478820199334	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.435216184902	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.171180323964	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.445054103554	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.321696301967	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.304956143751	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.426168946652	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.431639331947	I never said that.
0.0	0.457717823303	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.433470209256	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.451386211159	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.509759512488	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.438213213951	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.411449175176	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.433088324925	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.437725610059	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.405366999695	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.421198057015	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.467931342121	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.427746650803	You did.
0.0	0.506941850352	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.872426984618	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.446102927443	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.987572232389	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
1.0	0.437748060967	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.5	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.448943192986	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.428794226773	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.914201646126	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.5	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.42585015132	...
0.0	0.427397409142	I win.
0.0	0.517009734972	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.462055117538	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.465279336853	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.453201326736	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.491653018019	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.519507645877	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.428357298419	They don't like that.
0.0	0.478486688133	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.426959093553	No.
0.0	0.459826016255	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.433101390055	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.429913968328	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.39924994959	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.45472625417	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.969628468497	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.471717112905	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.288022237421	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.356051901539	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.392704517647	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.5	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.405572830061	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.464336868435	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.336439409136	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.487882759574	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.

0.0	0.42708632185	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.898986030259	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.322749363893	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.393263988877	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...

0.0	0.434739882316	It's their money.
0.0	0.413368203326	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.523936082759	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.43217858851	Well, thank you very much.

0.0	0.482092431282	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.

0.0	0.437295033752	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.00378937521707	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.426791319288	Thank you.

0.0	0.426033378207	But look...
0.0	0.452409513531	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.203895972655	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.

0.0	0.358252667872	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.704927768238	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.446662423206	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.846252493873	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.493549644368	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.445312098567	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.42041264716	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0450014316611	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.429826158527	You don't have to.
0.0	0.372988787166	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.329930950578	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.483086001138	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.456644483389	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.421874073935	I'm happy to answer the question...
1.0	0.45484095331	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.452007177466	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.666774835032	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.409740409899	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.5	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.443777210378	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.441833511988	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.372680884104	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.436954384509	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.438912303735	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.430214551923	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.802625602064	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.31463643244	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.438688494325	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.545040014719	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.82501257442	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.45075603497	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.406500674792	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.429336919145	That will change everything.
0.0	0.524323720065	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.438922404788	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.5	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.425458524644	We're running.
0.0	0.428357298419	I don't like that.
0.0	0.426971106102	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.410033838737	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.5	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.26771632921	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.463352239227	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.454852684783	We are at 90 percent coverage.
1.0	0.620206684147	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.43058488189	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.427669808963	But I was born here.
0.0	0.755353913691	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.535964364994	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.423902963342	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.5	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.432322427851	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.484749514693	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.330449912605	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
1.0	0.000451475081227	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.452181276078	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.0441556249718	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.465759568183	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.459832191467	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.522276021818	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.466108791801	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.452633493283	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.426791319288	Thank you.
0.0	0.00614268534804	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.45303500231	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.454186118693	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.860434455342	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.432414648448	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.416916640925	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.47253149814	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.446396290965	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.244784866014	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.426473154375	They know.
0.0	0.429075052822	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.459573218306	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.556296558276	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.434778496876	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.425805249859	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.429656209311	You know why three?
0.0	0.424948123292	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.386981752378	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.463083796931	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.409010346885	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.458571741694	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.448814347012	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.45312099375	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
1.0	0.475210221553	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.492253771473	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.445476195191	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.441211121126	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.455964823659	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.430516369934	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.000509313539445	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.42735374948	slot.
0.0	0.444201628882	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.430029602222	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.595925138985	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.429348622562	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.451579139545	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.451713214165	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.417296737005	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.521549995909	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.483850148777	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.444424187152	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.425978824388	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.443647569375	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.435350112925	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.458746095619	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.46753826946	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.531403892985	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.338504316936	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.442428778873	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.430897056731	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.442121404706	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.436213638807	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.574750184868	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.46933944737	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.519410477021	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.466782293872	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.39115460185	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.461438171938	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.154415181547	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.426364020596	OK?
0.0	0.42644394967	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.672176959131	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.430735745989	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.283588843611	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
1.0	0.458457340112	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.450820342003	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.408601294917	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.427696050267	You know that.
0.0	0.785290107848	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.434747734718	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.447650058124	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.981952541267	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.42705163277	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.439894817609	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.454823954772	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.431099637946	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.412209783105	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.65200042137	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.475665727999	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.773275298635	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.52078102953	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.45728040093	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.423134205747	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.425579835985	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.434691908779	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.517586736928	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.446768852017	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.414571770754	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.290497099688	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.421569616997	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.509755002574	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.426431819763	...Thank you.
0.0	0.426364020596	OK?
1.0	0.505390914852	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.448967262366	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.426713206982	John?
0.0	0.471935126289	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.438507529027	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.433026458454	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.290731611994	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.453281954875	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.388100034919	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.446684098268	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.363787574062	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.492959825466	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.417015462552	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.453579308815	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.42624740046	And why?
0.0	0.490536691699	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.494816579272	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.428878415884	Big difference.
0.0	0.441915483468	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.540082360704	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.433838036537	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.138431196175	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.372560648769	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.408260646649	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
1.0	0.676260121111	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.429731645522	That's good.
0.0	0.5	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.429214051023	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.579735610454	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.451765242158	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.451336443655	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.481961068166	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.428273925865	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.624502337874	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.429019332041	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.422974074237	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.480001563086	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.434665702777	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.432071465512	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.437674257625	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.603189159419	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.150033351072	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.0171501121846	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.449467118427	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.374910529815	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.436055000366	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.483552050448	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.427577887478	It is.
0.0	0.615243914073	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.569086783847	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.507417888035	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.641800795365	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.475763078085	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.459334315333	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.509610272643	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.440006174168	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.431203220508	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.213664827509	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.575463737932	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.227430941634	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.442529312815	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.433153909935	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.483109295967	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.5	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.530421005634	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.602204768949	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.409562115635	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.427183347496	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.430446763423	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.420083890479	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.480676981275	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.527773925085	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.000348593251466	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.426364020596	OK.
0.0	0.421678008817	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.438669058911	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.428623978532	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.723240429132	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.448741309212	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.473860944498	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.296617240239	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.489525890563	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.468177649837	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.819813386674	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.41452684674	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.396588327086	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.44041934012	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.437094948267	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.192823596237	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.5	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.43556519187	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.432468643882	You have to lead.
0.0	0.717011551317	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.434506660068	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.505040370228	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.480224636239	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.565228366646	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.39983674598	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.368357936261	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.438945615201	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.43532351849	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.478578035981	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.56563562866	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.41622177349	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.44842010326	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.5	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.42716184094	Well, I did.
0.0	0.441724255452	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.443102794277	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.5	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
1.0	0.430263964782	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.438734259264	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.440045179321	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.513998010315	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.431003583249	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.446991739314	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.436564523539	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.144634472585	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.480611671367	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.353235116887	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.476702079545	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.691545265678	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.427266227353	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.433711126774	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.244787839656	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.441885621378	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.425624649238	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.551763836448	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.446362229652	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.420674090543	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.724375230618	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.418192381655	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.588729089283	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
1.0	0.881660054352	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.474251187396	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.43860887757	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.65036276784	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.461385297653	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.469512969533	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.443161094564	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.382460161028	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.426959093553	No.
0.0	0.49207933645	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	7.36050852689e-05	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.347924874188	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.42585015132	...
1.0	0.971251387886	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.591014331827	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.539015594833	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.321704341496	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.432538210181	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.0794725153754	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.341862579271	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.704023006717	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.436414499175	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.444416069209	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.430182637596	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.465643836756	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.468719132215	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.428167746928	Our next president...
0.0	0.473107461194	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.437164891713	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.518675105903	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.372008357148	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.433832574958	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.438053396707	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.447314159415	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.365579717564	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.42585015132	...
0.0	0.458605810897	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.211789716739	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.458859227694	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.430348619206	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.457912303783	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.458638312264	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.408338705458	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.43435619389	I have no idea.
0.0	0.132232274796	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.223120359853	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.438516787838	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.429560813073	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.0191985514847	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
1.0	0.436585807331	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.432638331337	That's fine.
0.0	0.50795692472	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.440738316804	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.429532838514	I want security.
0.0	0.614047371648	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.436700387219	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.48125726198	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.444083559699	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.480206682328	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.51645977976	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.0209881830382	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.446172589309	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.438346437384	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.451648161707	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.000675634541676	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.466818379707	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.523478044574	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.425724389968	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.

0.0	0.450714127199	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.485139256169	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.450375256549	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.427179040143	I like that.

0.0	0.50977081975	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.485845311391	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.44828191162	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.790275147176	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.43689565913	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.423358111937	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.530958786538	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.440851480111	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.461675104706	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.552057595528	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.424479904465	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.549512644969	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.465531968201	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.429246905313	And we are not England.
0.0	0.592913596423	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
1.0	0.676278877335	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.71788950887	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.431834330984	What have you got now?
0.0	0.450601446666	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.431629479205	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.416566889373	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.426931084253	I do.
0.0	0.475628407024	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.431094221993	They're a scam.
0.0	0.429097583616	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.457915472362	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.437596835125	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.422057865986	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.586543830484	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.531906256349	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.437500370968	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.456020834831	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.412632198776	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.247412554756	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.427236868089	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.340714070195	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
1.0	0.451539093654	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.402279648844	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.426311155816	You know why?
0.0	0.429108607644	And you know what?
0.0	0.434547720399	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.395734224706	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.278411468709	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.61841460232	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.68949046133	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.43337236434	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.449080747768	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.433401481728	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.469116946006	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.426176136491	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.961204341598	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.463628292504	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.252736980823	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.426791319288	Thank you.
0.0	0.546636627163	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.453803743668	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.455551367884	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.000229042704128	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.585097686549	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.407513825442	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.164243969654	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.41293963991	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.418310533197	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.429034511012	So we need new leadership -- yes.
1.0	0.451120623969	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.439309969892	Just for the record.
0.0	0.307187841448	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
1.0	0.440596269479	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.426534866002	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.426456072385	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.929212448812	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.571819433253	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.411048503068	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.55973634974	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.421563194937	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.429791890139	You really can't.
0.0	0.831855977893	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.432795667687	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.429363842693	OK, good.
0.0	0.422494259219	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.430115028282	I'm ready.
0.0	0.431152545777	I know every one.
0.0	0.414398079485	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.667139192348	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.43557630945	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.444288026629	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.43209349999	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.431400386346	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.76620266785	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.841920501491	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.51382671318	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.43217858851	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.447739868326	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.50985105939	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.427198796192	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.408818342402	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.470078934648	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.512791002196	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.444489273987	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.44174131257	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.432402899073	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.440615504757	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.453216179763	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.462234337578	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.445319761106	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.460320126976	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.459953965122	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.470294796724	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.

0.0	0.365625474285	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.601810940768	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.999999938549	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.

0.0	0.435005703787	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.425826024039	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.708908368288	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.

0.0	0.44451902371	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.521335676896	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.00430502875738	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.450397964329	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.623479077047	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.606300014138	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.268905199374	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.

0.0	0.575845716642	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.925791458089	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.429537318308	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.726611860347	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.360815003793	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.439809672001	I would also just say this.

0.0	0.429133660667	That's my view.
0.0	0.425694169303	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.

0.0	0.459619564898	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.431328504316	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.484666394091	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.337066992374	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.

0.0	0.388486688152	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.435060308267	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.399858444809	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.459439473596	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.81877628783	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.47992910948	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.458288846537	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.439097970096	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.53740212349	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.465923623691	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.386248359123	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.42891355017	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.439121698118	It was a terrible sight.
1.0	0.473866475075	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.90877964772	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
1.0	0.688532281381	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.210592527734	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.5	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.439034844623	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.543995925974	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.447049227392	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.136245737064	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
1.0	0.983486463917	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.430499848973	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.408317354462	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.449606365215	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.473678753699	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.473177613391	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.44991928414	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.476468836735	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.225559693821	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.437133269054	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.439096663064	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.455694251099	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.426525219768	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.454966698531	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.537720663497	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.554238385313	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.43312745909	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.487358036078	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.389931809948	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.436975606293	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.424164582385	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.42559590137	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.429753285409	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.0212466143314	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.5	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.463852721825	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.579785918601	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.437862595235	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.990035385352	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.438688102633	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.225366791965	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.666774835032	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.995323544281	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.46327792253	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.431003583249	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.458928231074	That was before he was running against me.
1.0	0.690846093887	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.585604786524	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.426897900939	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.459359855239	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.441198795979	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.439303730228	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.472574319406	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.240736848369	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.455012659687	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.477941050311	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.72968548172	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.375169809813	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.5653025531	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.431197132843	That's not right.
0.0	0.475377990664	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.44393734548	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.442421125547	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.446957225113	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.42704074528	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.427132670665	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.4481418364	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.660744863309	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
1.0	0.80400403539	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.454937862753	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.426536801066	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.437209333103	The world has changed.
0.0	0.432830471585	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.539009472266	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.246615988312	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.466455049489	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.428321644345	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.42641325366	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.480227462429	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.432316808351	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.0425321458801	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.251317775876	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.697324569427	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
1.0	0.557269487484	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.646765671535	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.480008506365	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.460760934158	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.451889970647	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.411496740788	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.42941919105	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.101460771729	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.444702919265	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.36392059879	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.423676804818	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.489943300996	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.442429260563	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.758050106436	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.170897580261	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.544964693945	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.455721750087	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.421008048874	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.431811249127	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.777025047572	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.54790841506	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.437930906663	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.430253033789	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.586680364173	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.48021645007	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.444098642464	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.390019146968	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.432796192451	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.428032510683	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.422791344147	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.439076227143	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.0238490537497	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.441906136587	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.436801909021	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.260822573703	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.53356029789	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.491470499578	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.368283482747	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.451901145683	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.19202626946	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.00110636030374	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.957313464289	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.179325758753	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.462640225563	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.393634184756	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.453760486065	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.461399594555	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.431556607216	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.42676798533	I can.
0.0	0.435610100212	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.433254698218	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.431913832002	I said no.
0.0	0.430691809907	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.427853517246	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.448083207151	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.660581658768	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.0192886909768	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.430817254039	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.999999895362	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.54978171406	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.5	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.412167123467	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.457500547871	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.49340086698	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.447778482816	The planes are older than the pilots.
1.0	0.469478630775	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.566509165757	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.722273507535	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.309426187654	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.427192207643	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.53481206597	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.437708223577	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.302574657756	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.476832053891	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.482395012125	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.432190444475	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.439808518145	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.432726131781	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.429119188908	I love this country.
0.0	0.477382570714	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.322318042335	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
1.0	0.671128153023	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.556724613025	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.45821002464	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.439664747915	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.447419201904	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.464991201346	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.429276426734	I will do that.
0.0	0.424337889512	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.600960293208	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.435190899511	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.738412760704	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
1.0	0.652337566715	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.458460318043	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.424113166262	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.638713329936	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.418874101868	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.640125235545	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.

0.0	0.458639034533	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.519390416329	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.289669091957	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.397649509121	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.350204787997	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.

0.0	0.429238643447	...income tax...
0.0	0.0857572362727	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.419281860976	I think you're --
0.0	0.547903089473	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.37092297789	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.429108607644	And you know what?
0.0	0.471862394273	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.372921472067	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.431197132843	That's not right.
0.0	0.444166124506	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.422999050247	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.633703678049	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.445203194594	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.431639331947	I never said that.
0.0	0.457028689144	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.5	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.440111950404	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.0246494850379	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.492274274714	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.416396757278	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.5	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.464916045	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.464126868141	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.341779267657	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.438797928215	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.623096561801	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.250175344533	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.42549647183	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.443132945842	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.427746650803	It was.
0.0	0.687565685577	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.559861704389	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.50805961226	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.427968486971	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.42041264716	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.429969849401	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.387933318055	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.485349364145	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.417765233016	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
1.0	0.5	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.432069256714	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.429819755532	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.434247821993	That's what he is.
0.0	0.42850648327	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.449624492525	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.633858327783	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.426959093553	No.
1.0	0.445238819584	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.538548879516	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.426364020596	Yes.
0.0	0.278298311291	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.380161907346	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.481286165133	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.422523424437	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.483556764265	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
1.0	0.505507887456	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.409407588732	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.52571684712	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.448340435719	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.374511351881	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.433777242151	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.151351407766	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.5	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.438268861512	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.480239680288	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.449751746152	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.44167142192	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.597531948579	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.464114249354	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.445430288513	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.5	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.415254213002	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.478608460466	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.433040301268	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.486965389671	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.859782225914	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.447596235074	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.438344300857	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.566905941069	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.719273668185	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.431224641504	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.467587689082	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.44223111379	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.454984867149	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.455098368437	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.55576208807	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.521715832417	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.424069433886	You just want to...
0.0	0.42984964608	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.5	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.506886152978	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.437597123678	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.468233297914	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.439173867997	No vision at all.
0.0	0.614795719597	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.42307412295	You find me...
0.0	0.396661438695	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.54298636943	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.428678188698	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.587995127691	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.198021480978	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.563372825451	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.5	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.430824310691	He's wrong.
0.0	0.455151978973	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.712875637682	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.440720895361	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.429126872119	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.812502476778	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.43099839101	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.817005987802	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.492423242854	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
1.0	0.538532543092	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.356918804024	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.5	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.45761057195	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.481108089611	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.421678885441	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.576032138698	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.426364020596	Yeah.
0.0	0.438276364237	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.43331593364	They were wrong.
0.0	0.230760916112	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.431238934928	A terrible sight.
1.0	0.484706930626	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.558160061742	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.523682257088	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.434500371095	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.446143505703	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.434025180748	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.33288959566	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.208299759494	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.465559257903	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.449131546389	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.441944378609	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.451012342058	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.55920534134	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.630787839584	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.488663131026	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.42543519811	I understand.
0.0	0.715330011337	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.43265656933	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.476120748122	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.435634603043	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.424562624865	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.428325816858	Think about it.
0.0	0.48701672165	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.428805170464	She was right.
0.0	0.509818569864	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.491759895676	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.453093557775	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.443848921684	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.654668120091	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.350410548698	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.64700166551	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.443597244705	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
1.0	0.442555000081	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.00117410072369	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.42064909796	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.465876506928	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.390010983531	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.42712421116	Creativity.
0.0	0.421651918872	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.438615942426	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.559276774602	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.476864357114	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.468040946858	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.5	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.436308889482	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.33725557403	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.572911794062	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.468373572834	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.5	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.427806212082	You can have him.
0.0	0.467763978406	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.436251678822	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.440061605551	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.447482063199	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.451332667787	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.430287124372	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.426787516557	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.5	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.13945529247	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.492572580442	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.471169024416	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.523814479317	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.43652530832	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.446550521074	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.194027941876	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.426364020596	Yes.
0.0	0.197856194302	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.490638413842	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.00870113907026	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.43788803668	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.421828633283	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.42585015132	...
0.0	0.434388488453	...10% flat rate...
1.0	0.430518423616	Very few children.
0.0	0.710287561898	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.417733181288	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.443804868041	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.426791319288	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.281225230785	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.426791319288	Thank you.
0.0	0.405666449698	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.5	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.460068065648	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.425476502917	And...
0.0	0.455276674706	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.464061760314	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.434999276178	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.53052468237	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.517763264161	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.390371627955	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.406843782422	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.429266103778	No, John.
0.0	0.600603123726	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.531574620887	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.557017369751	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.401737339276	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.588742932219	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.259858015295	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.452990341109	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.5	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
1.0	0.444627232277	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.351220292614	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.435542502311	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.632554464528	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.432342761694	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.876611716997	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.774387524191	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.519953915914	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.446599576051	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.45407854191	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.455346964948	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.429323602095	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.539979293406	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.243687243869	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.412536517758	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.594799207456	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.579938265081	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.677430695508	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.468294006449	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.119934343686	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.427740501376	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.443846352631	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.375736289924	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.432051160237	Two points.
0.0	0.416990805052	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.477632315075	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.430662080828	Well, I mean right here.
1.0	0.595925138985	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.429560813073	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.44048398781	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.506944566795	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.401974775684	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.441381231343	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.409496293181	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.457113059463	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.569337059268	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.463510572032	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.429003838863	They understand that there's a national security risk.
1.0	0.492614063337	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.427456974677	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.681384752778	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.45367024985	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.475007360397	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.931428200359	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.437965088974	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.415238743403	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
1.0	0.875969810157	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.449899305157	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.392725149827	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.433103759802	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.426791319288	Thank you.
0.0	0.471050604401	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.426364020596	Yes.
1.0	0.467157548873	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.472907966044	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.64028478196	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
1.0	0.429652102591	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.461667473019	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.440032929198	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.266198519199	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.454925870456	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.538603468798	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.531346754126	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.121795935933	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.492778540993	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.36393514135	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.587632831689	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.790746889946	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.5	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.433065856332	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.352992008411	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.425754669274	Becky --
0.0	0.421789427106	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.42128494404	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.444426071829	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.425754669274	Neil...
0.0	0.445903515588	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.439029459627	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.552750293362	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.437978877457	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.434591719296	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.487492908406	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.442438846118	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.330688545946	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.434604046984	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.509596872689	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.437960029516	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.42583033119	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.472721611616	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.473606202002	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.429921688717	We have no borders.
1.0	0.698961884149	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.287392736725	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.521484512893	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.422708617897	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.515872887841	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.0479090924112	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.434293504329	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.655309106296	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.473120156599	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.5	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.454401243154	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.276011232622	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.471470371477	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.364116410128	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.798371823812	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.435033730421	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.484724908607	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.459483812965	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
1.0	0.432075683766	They stole it.
1.0	0.491048842475	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.542585019591	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.5	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.265731550586	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.456655403928	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.424051538736	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.528134848013	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.406599346683	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.489278153543	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.50801774108	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.436951266365	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.471017705372	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
1.0	0.464629707541	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.432845156778	And for good cause.
0.0	0.367430554709	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.424503927994	You bet they do.
0.0	0.409913218992	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.439357721073	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.520643505779	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.442151232462	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.426836357903	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.942477693966	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.451125282296	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.428403156141	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.512393860076	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.283260548944	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.441801004415	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.585913863504	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.435510658676	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.547503071289	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.428066311375	You're right.
0.0	0.594186584032	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.00506104079747	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.445775388083	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.717371078067	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.453914280375	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.147417847883	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.466955721284	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.406635412733	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.443288594877	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.387333871254	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.290603330394	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.448585507859	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.338786275009	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.494907920221	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.450727726468	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.432215668381	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.401580346625	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.5	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.430430730732	I can't do it.
0.0	0.482000745257	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.436138071814	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.556667123034	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.428490978903	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.485521257574	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.424854343756	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.528401746492	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.623318914124	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.471074243636	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.444592670596	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.401829667263	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.5	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.450542308051	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.456572913055	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.408077350442	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.540132377066	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.442730377015	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.574664227232	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.432478106231	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.437564952771	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.521841333961	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.426931084253	You do.
0.0	0.405689348452	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.538571498393	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.483502927136	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.427818743317	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.445098699217	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.593648120473	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.587623633644	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.563933389181	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.493712930211	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.568567927662	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.482506675584	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.43539503056	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.438168803517	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.487811099995	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.543749521619	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.465687251195	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.507425420741	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.507921569959	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.430687868488	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.179663209232	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.429771360827	What should we do?
0.0	0.446130515709	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.469133261851	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.510313281068	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.440104371446	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.430683071839	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.428351750608	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.56788325152	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.5	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.463420523012	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.421573617666	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.36211505328	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.444497303829	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.440665354594	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.361361273109	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.522205971011	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.562334651505	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.439386598769	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.377148219009	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.428315921886	This country is changing.
0.0	0.445623055025	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.431190114275	That's for sure.
0.0	0.424383617171	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
1.0	0.485782041536	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.601149299293	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.859942913377	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.452409631469	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.451468046279	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.0833303726912	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.688357628745	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.46829296655	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.451498376371	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.478307425016	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.40110158248	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.16131115279	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.452114756527	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.429721036257	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.436266936489	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.474902792724	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.425077697828	I have...
0.0	0.429276426734	I'll say this.
0.0	0.447328975194	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.469410012132	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.291517255629	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	3.1732352508e-05	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.5	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.508157272443	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.427695416648	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.432594945129	We were wrong.
0.0	0.400426453692	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.430225843106	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.00761311633074	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.438835622082	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.436610170818	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.405995177852	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.468105473463	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.431714043033	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.447340303549	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.453874898282	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.358255651948	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.484701713584	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.58255633365	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.940861670993	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.275250074183	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.419540391956	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.59997600367	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.431549300921	My point is this.
0.0	0.5	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.604072806802	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.433411233216	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.434101553426	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.560090934066	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.463217651541	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
1.0	0.5	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.428357298419	We don't need that.
0.0	0.476192296599	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.434870914901	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.472899231433	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.

0.0	0.429807800931	He does great.
0.0	0.275489279996	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.441053968678	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.

0.0	0.511643340819	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.

0.0	0.439080587305	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.572943704861	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.

0.0	0.481055105229	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
1.0	0.59414928957	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.63772202194	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.

0.0	0.0542664531815	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.427641010946	But we are where we are right now.

0.0	0.0343235684281	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.494917366513	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.

0.0	0.429692754496	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.429108607644	And you know what?
0.0	0.522742803849	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.555845909163	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.457554965917	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.521796622855	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.552680280165	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.4279826271	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.426364020596	Okay.
0.0	0.455490089736	I have many friends that deal with China.

0.0	0.431616211327	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.461823205034	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.438164167922	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.555202642098	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.581280630583	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.428095389788	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.444620017066	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.

0.0	0.430395192509	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.455502945143	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.311890861758	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.486215698252	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.455443298914	But we allowed people to keep health care.

0.0	0.437573983045	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.45381138052	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.484925270058	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.646677894434	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.453018009859	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.471326155247	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.459022688002	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.677882586475	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.

0.0	0.444659109281	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.414956968101	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.438458886451	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.467933111859	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.

0.0	0.505619605318	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.394136950251	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.442508252455	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.429164569338	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.5	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.46640381722	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.493218308116	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.440018518189	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.

1.0	0.836146520498	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.472392776574	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.

0.0	0.404022594789	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.400026974506	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.

0.0	0.328742303387	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.517075905689	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.451496239781	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.475275895233	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.487213330865	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.804956987316	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.448477708845	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.425155866815	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.403871614416	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.478493311416	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.858210930742	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.451528718263	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.426931084253	We do.

0.0	0.42886882631	It never happens.
0.0	0.398020626375	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.439725520909	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.652330813104	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.457736560927	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.679252303337	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.435026518321	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.415723824787	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.408979555008	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.397728100477	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.64664038398	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.448266793786	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.0790119877997	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.458617927195	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.476231402686	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.440972318031	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.592835559597	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.451002801306	We have been talking about it for decades.
1.0	0.884420007118	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.579940512074	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.441479153373	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.024188535942	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.487018923372	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.64797879822	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.465427371078	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.11251919571	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.808906624776	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.437441623678	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.488071004339	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.483429334053	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.508783308367	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.491166190481	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.428073002267	Can we stop?
0.0	0.348988188601	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	1.00000009947e-07	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.421428609516	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.403906245944	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.538693388209	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.456497030994	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.914535249937	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.44520410427	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.434334352918	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.407041099275	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.468042360879	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.743446744774	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.391040718096	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.431155715482	I would change them.
0.0	0.356667286487	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
1.0	0.731464515745	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.448446941392	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.31474021197	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.102040677632	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.454373704631	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.458116783319	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.685977798841	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.0115274123241	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.602204768949	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.0564501241938	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.457113059463	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.476351422632	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.545325758784	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.423089461325	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.524485347579	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.419004881904	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.439286465206	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.446226254608	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.483827099255	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.436412521533	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.424078977506	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.4295762023	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.430099994538	That's right.
0.0	0.428784979491	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
1.0	0.627768858864	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.557668513919	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.433348994574	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.558773915139	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.648709888649	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.440092407632	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.435652600303	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.488435951571	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.603115505323	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.

0.0	0.444205635813	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.468339944706	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.

0.0	0.401762466636	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.524689443126	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.40149160411	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	1.76794312027e-07	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.426959093553	No.

0.0	0.428540608041	They have infrastructure.

0.0	0.448472646021	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.438103952301	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.397423297179	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.0131608479305	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.488212895547	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.126210123785	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.436942880959	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.445114367222	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.425641627412	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.437900003513	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.335358880535	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.439413745706	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.430036836456	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.585747641774	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.436666441721	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.531655745307	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.452908380907	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.521505806833	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.4326267925	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.638696639642	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.40595097977	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.

0.0	0.426959093553	No.
0.0	0.450445785644	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.460624665171	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.310580110832	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.435990843302	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.49188491687	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.485306256116	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.45649186946	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.532533003978	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.190947692558	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.427903791163	in particular.
0.0	0.468785393044	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.5	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.436445627886	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.736894288486	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.44099981134	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.418997401445	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.429633367758	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.395124152644	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.431472562916	You do legislation.
0.0	0.424420865067	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.417715747226	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.5	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.44268189704	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.391407457746	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.429574515813	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.682886010329	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.463054268635	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.

0.0	0.427677275747	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.193306557643	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.386747997335	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.0819218119921	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.409683864788	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.316703701559	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.431585933239	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.475112953439	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.421520763564	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.488711595671	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.424545146116	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.718472877227	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.437485554905	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.368211446576	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.43205974337	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.585989679478	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.443656761124	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.5	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.426791319288	Thank you.
0.0	0.429684673014	We actually did it.
0.0	0.362907223958	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.44617039779	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.413322539915	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.433081791915	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.433060556894	to save a company.
0.0	0.43331541899	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.425476502917	But...
0.0	0.441462494563	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.652738698581	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.477758779046	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.423075792087	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.422522956869	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.5	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.528401746492	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.422062469034	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.431197132843	That is not right.
0.0	0.43266501276	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.429906180368	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.475510917468	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.486392043541	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.00131929549491	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.442099618358	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.489591287051	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.444397985925	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.430621814277	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.430712377989	They're a scam.
0.0	0.625334953926	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.470391551355	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.541822940993	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.429089146619	On welfare.
0.0	0.614901318918	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.218088492659	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.424814478461	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.445706465988	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.427824849528	Divide that out.
0.0	0.428611501267	How do I know this?
0.0	0.43041035535	In addition to that...
0.0	0.429856430891	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.56874339523	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.438169021886	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.542684921503	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.740587500482	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.473704360776	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.425601434613	Again...
0.0	0.424622567744	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.0329959008784	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.612834062711	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.431969126906	How great is that?
0.0	0.514719961415	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.507889291305	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.435610076209	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.42817704157	No, it's true.
0.0	0.472160005286	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.594189498015	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.440125476635	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.520241589164	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.527078048027	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.467931342121	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.448068790385	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.428048299905	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.426495383302	Ever.
0.0	0.431076198666	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.43137926722	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.0814966340524	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.430494937982	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.414486008078	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.474800164765	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.467646535155	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.465224588129	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
1.0	0.508069331029	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.445762010156	It's good to be with you.
1.0	0.579137553397	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.434734821231	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.484842759356	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.426791319288	Thank you.
0.0	0.554359897938	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.431057662624	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.439419602102	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.5	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.434514684195	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.459970620143	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.318717233719	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.355837020431	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.429165750825	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.474128608937	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.463040452829	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.470790956069	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.314879350229	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.442170423987	That is our government today.
0.0	0.458135231113	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.455877272157	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.548086604256	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.541890945681	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.452658753819	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.450159975876	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.407731302626	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.425155866815	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.431003583249	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.425534277629	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.525239821748	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.427024950615	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.430947908995	So you know what?
0.0	0.426791319288	Thank you.
0.0	0.443450989842	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.519967958012	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.474342917121	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.448720756697	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.485665913169	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.383850497369	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.781233529099	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.735692018256	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.5	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.433149686382	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.428067584652	Wait for what?
0.0	0.426235899108	It's true.
0.0	0.422285398456	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.432391277949	That never works.
0.0	0.606519105591	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.378548896086	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.434162531098	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.0738016990566	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.45275056534	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.7593292022	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.414842703823	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.477503065401	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.427313885117	HEMMER: Wow.
