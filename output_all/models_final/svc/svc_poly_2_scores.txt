0.0	0.305110045441	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
1.0	0.973117875894	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.604298907645	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.416783028382	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.0680816637802	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.419372257556	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.351432079472	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.542303867496	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.388560035775	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.536558469491	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.51023305162	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.55897903882	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.796553490083	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.518047730656	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.836802390241	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.370060768321	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.44704535434	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.338792502329	And God bless America.
0.0	0.38312644972	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.0316813218737	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.268965191485	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.527753392111	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.379132963026	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.414886306073	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.467815837098	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.346278558723	Thank you.
0.0	0.422080727618	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.422849625116	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.361919728302	You looking at me?
0.0	0.379064466283	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.469943611129	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.444144418181	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.680047591835	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.175904619544	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.339981518387	He undermines it.
0.0	0.442790988847	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.627607072767	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.378189924943	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.252349164184	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.311116307018	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.383242877415	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.414425919632	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.363464613284	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.399883494351	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.421234359596	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.347646965766	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.390790391487	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.420135117825	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.419282837293	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.317623294903	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.356802772835	About Medicare?
0.0	0.344397728738	No -- no...
0.0	0.353140311027	We don't win.
0.0	0.520187900519	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.571087830058	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.406466567806	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.4858850531	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.589890752452	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.404595161634	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.383084966469	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.191611539542	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.433733740648	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.742967468435	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.336539092744	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.364425223826	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.426977769478	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.99566733556	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.349792933458	No.
0.0	0.647644244545	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.409506063876	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.393619742254	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.26134071723	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.377657393852	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.546410936148	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.429575272409	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.505553966831	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.336015521938	...Chris...
0.0	0.385506800352	That's not true.
0.0	0.349820809507	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.301075951965	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.317942669201	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.955187811726	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.344117439655	Yeah.
0.0	0.33852880596	These...
0.0	0.289813730611	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.36109713793	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.273967021079	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.331803772711	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.413643160798	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.999995093251	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.344117439655	OK.
0.0	0.440148206219	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.384675559116	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.703107604875	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.583903224247	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.333008398663	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.240158714324	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.63849821167	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.368704637867	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.382341685598	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.488179641275	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.362750365873	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.285213266867	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.349258452987	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.405071761934	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.270819316371	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.541426916667	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.572576761491	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.999998952701	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.419822916116	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.476819759424	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.360621320516	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.0120461825583	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.349336479242	John.
0.0	0.120792204779	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.34293512235	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.150581689641	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.363696952282	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.301801565736	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.444649099575	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.3979139453	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.301115095945	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.373569273416	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.38856236961	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.945538237908	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.334554273929	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.347353075338	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.377975755433	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.385297804027	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.321123674614	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.348164283303	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.305374813511	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.476278778889	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.383623120194	He was on the board.
0.0	0.335382456628	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
1.0	0.906837791464	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.308853474686	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.0148661351264	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.0294304039866	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.453014384985	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.422932104747	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.39059757803	My background is different.
0.0	0.525975908488	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.061457457953	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.406723903493	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.5	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.42998985047	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.43710900457	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.365128991604	We have to do something.
0.0	0.432919650665	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.40618379684	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.443750705759	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.352313629733	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.281584106477	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.333162646148	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.20548393791	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.250006896499	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.182805159516	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.289328449093	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.342629410458	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.456735532655	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.366721986152	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
1.0	0.34874672223	That's wrong.
0.0	0.417552004344	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.398841274478	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.375399673239	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.380530661046	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.5	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.604160768874	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.819163121343	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.557474063768	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.521770929177	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.355956419831	We need sound money.
0.0	0.35909831606	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.381741873728	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.330137147754	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.387796178318	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.344994364258	Illegal.
0.0	0.0659123587011	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.389869791514	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.153753156541	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.347272141889	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.313623317049	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.333065170726	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.487082399543	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.618414360612	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.322087008092	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.396536636857	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.383866864953	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.281534694323	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.366003472405	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.532643500186	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.295701397612	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.067988764017	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.239725438312	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.388839503492	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.423460782982	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.656076591573	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.824334982182	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.432076660743	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.347482090216	Right.
0.0	0.646445163021	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.249804374713	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.350956113463	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.622054931997	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.5	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.308578971422	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.871864662681	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.395288100794	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.435735451615	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.375521063721	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.454326641296	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
1.0	0.912186129986	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.330305986101	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.428589114368	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.44509580302	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.287538067492	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.488077523443	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
1.0	0.662201700127	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.921171299759	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.300701732745	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.415589062175	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.692502539512	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.340052398722	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.365267472814	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.356453818238	He's wrong.
0.0	0.168327946288	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.349859571588	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
1.0	0.171152458541	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.330445476721	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
1.0	0.851357196124	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.407695621369	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.476943932201	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.343050391193	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.233685247474	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.37163378042	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.186357854217	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.343071907941	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.401986037528	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.574441528508	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.0142269214225	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.438806741472	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.391428444214	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.436150617786	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.493545644367	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.979183202438	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.306080939147	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.335935920858	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.376887934697	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.70456602836	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.619478142934	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.32943843863	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.778761066745	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.46312435981	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.200145944621	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.408879427366	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.168718309229	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.147816757384	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
1.0	0.462145426113	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.412447457843	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.364396091054	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.4316015318	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.474559953184	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.590047363594	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.381708565001	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.348177287033	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.392960524837	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.422644789889	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.523591207533	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.429893074502	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.671009771128	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.351632110091	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.552297500053	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.527762148947	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.516313481988	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.606253483594	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.34636399277	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.552049003843	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.4780818019	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.470090440431	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.850726381038	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.0527261182309	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.844271806941	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.379487827499	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
1.0	0.421096778208	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.312700593226	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.394946375483	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.7322705831	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.420747851343	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
1.0	0.864728647878	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.346196769245	I totally get that.
0.0	0.393755728594	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.336263015322	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.322351215527	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.356098156154	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.343323167209	Check it out.
0.0	0.58165893769	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.651681784922	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.370509069823	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.396848508711	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.175142098975	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.438278900008	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.630913029767	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.384585259876	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.364559501487	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.264269290607	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.425430996319	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.359206193915	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.384737655312	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.359630305394	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.411629111554	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.724853568343	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.364327630939	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.361025339934	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.598940943187	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.241650523425	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.681640344589	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.595787348876	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.442176213516	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.38434474526	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.360659375839	And, we said no.
0.0	0.434098679933	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.456843380962	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.650275636491	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.323476586277	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.588961683257	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.440072784677	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.365146399676	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.366571691356	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.477145623768	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.45475295004	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.417416718227	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.3787843407	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.378437095419	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.340539363038	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.646181760224	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.782118464161	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.349792933458	No.
0.0	0.348275645369	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.426962143867	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.584886622792	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.387943106599	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.372131829374	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.387579368781	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.389479519411	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.322291698044	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.329665426134	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.602194923819	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.47980800911	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.474522941247	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.5	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.36590995148	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.348092489226	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.385409425039	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.419276185435	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.398350358114	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.548478000475	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
1.0	0.727794574258	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.993320814839	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.412773859671	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.322333253412	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.112751314982	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.470284655275	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.474123107262	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.287890680723	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.320941443773	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.389235839897	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.394310231955	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.450272878011	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.37388506237	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.713667501828	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.291618816803	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.510126224392	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.279598787778	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.35540037889	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.512838433018	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.360279963765	I don't care.
0.0	0.607013768563	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.559414139725	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.339774362429	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.547471582139	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.525753014404	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.345267482857	You're welcome.
0.0	0.34969461677	I have.
0.0	0.291092403424	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.350915904816	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.346667944709	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.189398733514	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.373325799911	Good at email.

0.0	0.390507158686	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.439489088797	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.413058759197	We're going to get more revenue.

0.0	0.485275393173	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.656172490483	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.626078515781	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.681226027965	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.312603567138	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.395050848745	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.280921980771	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.447271606313	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.00717136848731	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.486843628803	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.443328262174	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.455771395997	That's the end of the conversation.

0.0	0.346278558723	Thank you.
0.0	0.0671465251808	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.350666794879	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.347482090216	Absolutely.
0.0	0.595281865015	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.434954668178	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.415779738962	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.

0.0	0.625454163723	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.350323853706	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.729687521127	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.346248098797	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.216799997155	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.997341587488	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.336523265524	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.934035532573	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.818887393294	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.

0.0	0.453554558993	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.367729380112	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.300158495541	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.249439863389	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.733304424126	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.371224329703	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.333874447368	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.41018702851	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.40691956647	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.

0.0	0.30008826075	In all due respect...
0.0	0.866179300909	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.367573853502	We have a country of laws.

0.0	0.5	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.421526847692	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.0145445738948	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.404505798267	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.

0.0	0.361257391739	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.412675362123	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.0461890291016	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.370081880485	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.512695383213	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.366257002619	It's a joke.
0.0	0.544224556453	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.33930607456	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.348926744772	But I would add this.
0.0	0.69590333948	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.312901560343	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.477073646446	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.99627960681	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
1.0	0.636792478423	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.347482090216	Right.
0.0	0.62110689887	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.475850364649	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.334475010442	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.373781936602	No, the new planes.

0.0	0.463075798139	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.442519891046	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.462278023307	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.344117439655	OK?
0.0	0.488836799559	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.417117877429	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.389680944861	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.260854353387	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
1.0	0.380733770051	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.186357854217	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.

0.0	0.429699317108	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.265710238831	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.436070636563	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.157798344211	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.661164702163	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.381101800672	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.37914893329	The time to act is now.
1.0	0.589043741827	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.389534151017	Enough on fantasy football.
1.0	0.353284366616	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.358604790867	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.493533230262	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.413883330995	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.476490831147	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.461934595621	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.474328256587	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.488860487254	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.435047995082	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.51216810206	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.479239169838	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.419915946272	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.978599794479	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.0937973091042	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.505484798975	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.438296820807	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.405101742293	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.415793918412	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.831533784903	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.384710806923	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.360850412945	It never happens.
0.0	0.599802237015	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.387602180524	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.42033517781	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.377479900893	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.25053719881	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.441247847859	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.425813614115	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.666997911264	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.33551331854	...
0.0	0.333843855701	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.381833264885	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.441585401765	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.697200723359	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.401510616213	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.364546742086	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.449472708493	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.428801671025	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.829645166942	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.377389409464	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
1.0	0.517616915015	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
1.0	0.793117516293	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?

0.0	0.373912903343	You're simply not.
0.0	0.457578091911	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.961628509237	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.481233177307	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.316993356908	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.347482090216	Right.
0.0	0.365625208413	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.432995166174	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.385591658128	I was the architect.
0.0	0.358545786901	I would change them.
0.0	0.486708325651	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.526037763624	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.0303703584192	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.284620255318	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
1.0	0.429449540922	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.57632908482	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.143704866873	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.402690212979	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.382722211396	She voted for it.
0.0	0.354755124804	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.426916227285	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.408755590411	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.866841731343	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.392050648913	He was such a nice guy.

0.0	0.105439185167	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.395921619601	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.319788479422	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.

0.0	0.40419669698	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.363521840314	I'm prepared.
0.0	2.083345012e-07	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.399958278437	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.656224652862	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.519355283088	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?

0.0	0.43697040138	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.355229578159	Why is that?
0.0	0.319397893373	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.372558908376	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.509367660414	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.36935716308	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.159138611294	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.

0.0	0.346332421203	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.373952144934	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.375529082315	That is important.
0.0	0.1641623823	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.367974085128	John, I'd like to address this?

0.0	0.401132442493	That's my bill.
0.0	0.346681277265	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.321590613039	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.414847465027	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.173963137488	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
1.0	0.651377231649	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.337467824288	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.293108584052	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.361885930289	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.645033797875	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.01890583771	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.55544554089	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.334888476411	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.714413482807	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.351081693753	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.

0.0	0.558453659221	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.357664858558	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.467208256725	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.270564901625	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.484312828171	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.

0.0	0.594134101923	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.

0.0	0.412982773533	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.46706201535	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.392870046715	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.358784909438	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.489886639264	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.

0.0	0.274833460966	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.357467275652	They're off to China.
0.0	0.346278558723	Thank you.
0.0	0.367087519375	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.413478730112	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.35548161818	We're running.
0.0	0.399763975034	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.578900072286	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.385934002465	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.310157613753	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.454692189846	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.390316697393	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.1361373785	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.156813124685	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.442040135188	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.386397014713	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.3740725423	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.371521773989	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.684016852647	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.365920926227	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.0898139405858	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.163359845021	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.535630411733	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.41640048832	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.465026800622	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.343282142654	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.480411924297	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.373328762649	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.473993598712	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.777552624651	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.16713189455	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.381677812636	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.487053577223	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.556245783534	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.508460835526	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.305145045643	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.318886946954	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.752076936327	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.356714954026	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.367259617342	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.273583115697	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.40257230243	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.177583129565	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.557485097658	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.565710900092	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.403916979342	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.383317009003	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.413336190765	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.323483858584	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.455409103517	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.96241121212	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.322377246303	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.375726797159	I never said that.
0.0	0.355728660378	He has never defended...
0.0	0.365579041227	I will not do that.
0.0	0.453984175178	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.355914176817	Think about that.
0.0	0.434633721539	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.527679769716	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.0720394213364	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.512487298735	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.651531501456	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.367772428176	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.413263165104	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.447784761006	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.437713209298	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.34536562226	And here's why.
0.0	0.650434660576	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.939163766661	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.33639765319	So...
0.0	0.416417377193	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.322715981122	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.427453375961	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.541919373938	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.25231746924	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.813204337461	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.294399723663	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.411645085508	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.466701579466	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.37529697782	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.390483290276	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.318532200722	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.16484468398	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.400765262972	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.364738237985	I got that.
0.0	0.792323928968	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.563141600348	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
1.0	0.838810063917	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.5	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.697731990198	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.463583253007	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.338714907574	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.637431295527	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.39540875989	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.575552251545	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.577254759238	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.366386197484	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.36343492446	How about this?
0.0	0.734585756904	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.999999873618	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.345023967052	Why?
0.0	0.487085114807	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.334552785808	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.353899108077	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.339409061471	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.27580655042	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.520239189676	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.442952779422	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.443954459144	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.441236017031	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.434608756407	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
1.0	0.55694579605	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.508363695917	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.525593802884	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
1.0	0.605789268287	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.843942558261	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.371009117134	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.302920300394	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.231313273863	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.191922680806	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.379727460725	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.470343601081	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.540589645466	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.390048182307	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.658699275243	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.468071640644	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.396373846844	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.33551331854	...
0.0	0.332208251073	And you know what?
0.0	0.376844783432	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.350001771034	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.725242077885	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.332208251073	And you know what?
0.0	0.414396627666	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.423922472947	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.366867307967	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.474681484377	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.408634402388	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.668130116814	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.337404829922	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.33316234508	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.347482090216	Absolutely.
0.0	0.380383871134	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.295640932184	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.281856480197	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.361850302337	It's not working.
0.0	0.726466865817	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.866499768433	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.511124228542	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.084988543077	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.452080892218	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.269679785634	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.409517827921	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.379408560502	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.336015521938	...Chris...
0.0	0.789018323647	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.337638996135	Maria...
0.0	0.0770904782046	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.780197088281	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.412979996744	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.477906299019	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
1.0	0.411631934175	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.421674977426	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.354092304058	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.198735897059	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.267640031746	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.367551439495	I didn't.
0.0	0.518840341117	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.318695870248	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.175472803525	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.153511513472	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.356684940469	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.243249157667	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.840728801346	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.105205618108	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.217475220309	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.411568670088	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
1.0	0.644905586041	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.37437131504	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.155868190995	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.408615952114	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.394373356859	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.406641785489	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.471062500429	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.31673125049	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.350195951313	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.737876658656	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.430255960456	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.405149441972	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.402013210292	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.431224968952	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.401702461701	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.734986960002	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.363876025743	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.42172620113	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.617765928785	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.372550887956	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.368098434238	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.0653968934744	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.411837752185	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.331252487273	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.365942850652	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.47013931622	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.357065714789	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.374453503122	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.355749505939	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.415594126753	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.536253666724	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.642017903934	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.224923727759	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.12134249235	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.407905350838	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.558290985452	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.513180820334	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.517448400832	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.460247880488	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.327793919319	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
1.0	0.819847756616	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.409278603628	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.34743058817	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.389013551138	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.526396811856	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.397260495252	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.156130199098	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.591211670064	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.347884977414	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.973645313093	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.182115323101	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.692747828655	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.37216788348	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.356719060177	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.375399970996	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.362064266356	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.629869983161	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.344379500316	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.405936477493	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.408828040167	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.134918126649	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.0529545627391	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.244787771357	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.90160897397	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.336015521938	...John...
0.0	0.801677053775	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.223918698021	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.505370031612	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.340080491884	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.71217038276	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.5	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.385165456391	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.5	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.355080345195	You count on it.
0.0	0.381383943099	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.34729597404	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.414557469093	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.515301285058	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.389447303315	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.429108016906	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.383621292288	A brief response.
0.0	0.378787418139	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.414583177193	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.381165173882	The answer is no.
0.0	0.342081236733	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.5	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.739487319887	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.432055622377	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.387307161495	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.113855572017	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.481087495132	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.607808519947	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.468877269251	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.355956419831	We need sound money.
0.0	0.413541911442	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.531679603128	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.618573300002	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.417990229148	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.0105124886919	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.361373728068	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.522616638706	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.934108947497	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.790954871664	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.351848195703	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.411638028518	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.415181899998	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.368446069322	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.477412762023	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.183968117016	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.740242399361	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.445692423704	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.362511393676	So you might not.
0.0	0.577148539374	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.395497351061	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.52306021327	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.572467075579	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.745454110685	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.404584486705	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.608262892537	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.329931037218	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.508213543935	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.490401172685	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.347482090216	Right.
0.0	0.3634901565	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.590318013497	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.392129729849	That's fine.
0.0	0.707634861198	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.383406473018	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.426447033555	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.350654440289	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.35302499947	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.431377880295	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.557799832185	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.366644331788	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.370991143473	No, you did.
0.0	0.554255646225	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.224825404841	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.816854743976	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.367676713841	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.543662308849	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.388658162891	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.366515022765	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.348376845597	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.276875313125	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.493033393327	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.653784192816	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.29352572495	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.346278558723	Thank you.
0.0	0.672184001745	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.521859939381	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.328174150281	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.227099219052	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.317319156776	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.38480798101	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.382990874924	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.357833985613	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.394223999089	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.401209919867	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.432823903126	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.0474030716283	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.0300592972166	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.481036477505	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.427673211215	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.418317727007	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.362867258005	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
1.0	0.626378368895	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.361209069026	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.5	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.291644437478	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.355093812624	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.432454958627	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.349990945345	Think about it.
0.0	0.310520290695	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.347528227681	That's what we need.
0.0	0.397916189488	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.433674211747	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.351377442549	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.40520223172	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.608170329806	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.356804684726	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.043437054974	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.421660138265	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.831998436204	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.

0.0	0.386229190809	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.371235177032	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.366980348755	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.38783338061	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.386637962471	He hit oil.
0.0	0.348457408871	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.365161666339	No, no.
0.0	0.423215026072	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.522327521322	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.413828113347	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.349330719972	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
1.0	0.117621360846	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.374110264275	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.458621813689	Where did that spirit come from in America?
1.0	0.826119964472	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.0479057170248	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.383021003058	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.531395510162	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.56326965781	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.584119247923	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.267155493227	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.517372051327	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.270124505931	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.228706147294	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.433574485902	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.395717281787	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.236869143427	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.437419874732	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.555195940734	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.364837442229	Neil, I was mentioned too.
1.0	0.550858731714	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.36906216899	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.628269981357	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.58114343907	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.363544283302	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.355905847124	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.410573847557	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.529606505028	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.337492454471	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.355691499324	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.351737527576	This will end.
0.0	0.350215570245	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.477090687776	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.355199444493	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.115327036162	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.349730735017	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.593661745038	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.401160961518	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.36482424117	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.373336010702	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.459092927922	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.225808539633	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.291460278192	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.568048862183	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.703963689952	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.377679972379	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.367223147431	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.400904202639	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.412883269475	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.376807912936	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.911589782128	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.494956163799	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.345578341509	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.430493905185	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
1.0	0.352834270891	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.365592309498	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.493567900698	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.562360780679	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.365650767068	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.240818720611	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.280445003508	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.714297867412	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.895293308877	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.570930015181	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.295417686852	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.0139171564557	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.525778469143	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.618558248916	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.437835212921	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.734187401676	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.492231477728	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.37614291165	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.583496795133	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.772786576254	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.033587926967	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
1.0	0.587549851628	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.468791116469	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.976862475615	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.673353436759	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.414601099269	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.466059906753	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.741735344454	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.37001240484	This is the same old stuff since I left.
1.0	0.425855286976	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.784616658404	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.780673880069	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.292092332127	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.392858966183	That's what I said.
0.0	0.422637673274	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.428908714439	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.401626141552	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
1.0	0.545002425338	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.430488429353	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.385333977003	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.353918526116	I can do that.
0.0	0.380608154927	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.59215384129	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.131606648023	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.885164620884	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.341014650881	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.646258139716	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.413335168363	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.591686343222	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.409683439739	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.18730345086	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.124855767007	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.800929389052	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.368481533729	We are not France.
0.0	0.30459770272	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.368448481317	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.39470050109	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.494131683365	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.3634901565	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.300223230071	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.531157520571	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.294175557018	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.352997754721	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.383570359438	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.00031981328754	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.519600722044	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.452079205019	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.344014325239	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.781115478413	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
1.0	0.360453121985	They were wrong.

0.0	0.424836336612	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.414592020776	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.101791995298	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.317411193705	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.618691989655	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.376560775467	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.581386221046	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.824010199447	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.

0.0	0.481510586114	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.615282094755	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.319703974542	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.418215226068	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.438383544503	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.351753782368	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.404224647697	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.372748293844	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.452145368143	We would still have racism holding people back.
1.0	0.44019273809	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.993983883128	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.4690959915	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.463041345508	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.315821898657	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.35177956368	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.398786099022	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.124181434922	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.422904197391	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.395652882081	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.307873535201	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.403660164521	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.645215673655	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.343005231288	See?
0.0	0.375457343357	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.380368029308	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.494326687812	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.35642968173	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.5	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	1.0	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.0327840457374	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.416678766687	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.406228084914	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.65847711076	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.350347327882	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.5	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.801485313012	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.785136067414	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.396885481215	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.335243683996	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.799188758448	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.633759345694	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
1.0	0.565160739741	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.694269447166	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.00231464776388	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.346546453236	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.400450356952	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.349550920819	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.330835816743	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.407583211954	That's the difference.
0.0	0.0140066409314	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.33686019337	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.389383092987	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.344347005528	Well, sure.
1.0	0.745052919092	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
1.0	0.430802474379	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.390747884791	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.00958013975973	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.67292098013	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.30730640163	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.472973398415	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.347168874549	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.448437435561	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.709847177034	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.772625562634	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.565417851778	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.299340922542	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.387538750153	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.357764829851	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.295672758855	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.331728852796	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.203607300003	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.33542196646	Came out great.
0.0	0.5	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.397142875339	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.322118076289	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.366442590782	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.33621649177	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.354014382301	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.436526677144	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.401914343442	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.380326826266	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.352933168977	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.490931875098	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.600170650572	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.181534573208	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.249067002446	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.45201889209	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.50655511948	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.358013878947	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.0358624584966	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.69625596231	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
1.0	0.385277936456	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.182519469828	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.47408909094	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.543277720592	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.35192247874	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.250368468641	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.340276577188	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.0350890909607	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.443027228126	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.371746395799	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.447425957545	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.714095000213	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
1.0	0.478042112983	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.323385257446	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.563078233558	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.419415987363	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.298642906277	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.306657691288	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.361195446884	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.47785464179	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
1.0	0.527378576632	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.40445573984	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.0863942840306	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.347482090216	Right.
0.0	0.438074450108	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.165846149942	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.68029792917	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.276473120598	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.28196477242	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.269901761122	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.350553102157	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.554965871537	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.320086719511	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.470253954836	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.171253762631	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.330277861152	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.244089506701	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.850884207232	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.367576819101	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.367749820807	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.379237065252	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.5	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.440267077581	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.785614613134	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.749753127976	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.357161455941	...before I go.
0.0	0.34145571116	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.404588880906	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.273280748104	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.466731079199	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.377867486284	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.903667556333	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.246079911756	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.165820763017	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.158806511933	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.579382579783	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.375726797159	I never said that.
0.0	0.406444165395	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.364316353386	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.404660306584	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.351423954992	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.409490362355	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.337835492971	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.37219990013	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.373909369638	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.274966699211	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.319252978823	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.376363659231	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.357303131301	You did.
0.0	0.513413222427	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.922666054223	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.423481537805	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.898726890052	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
1.0	0.398282880667	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.463289527958	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.393907977977	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.374549989099	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.890907690801	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.439090511271	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.33551331854	...
0.0	0.3517623182	I win.
0.0	0.544771128885	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.481989716319	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.425933956905	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.418190869804	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.489097090686	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.472750902667	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.350555316191	They don't like that.
0.0	0.394522997492	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.349792933458	No.
0.0	0.486156944097	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.3887143018	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.38290679475	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.336566737405	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.43966470936	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.904556211459	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.470671297572	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.150868978745	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.268084500624	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.309239738783	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.526683128634	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.

0.0	0.353799697693	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.796413758096	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.269555463484	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.

0.0	0.288679433819	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.353029405394	Well, thank you very much.

0.0	0.399189324387	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.334709260897	But look...
0.0	0.329478600292	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.224706472476	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.

0.0	0.376809277327	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.657701076377	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.315921967566	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.856288457216	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.519601036656	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.36025920038	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.27732963089	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0190467397569	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.

0.0	0.558848786373	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.347622671218	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.344773159743	I'm happy to answer the question...
1.0	0.487544900076	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.363444097329	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.801939232846	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.391778593786	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.538703795655	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.399274320175	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.353957552851	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.318297132366	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.376107060011	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.390968526796	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.37122241168	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.918405123826	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.18870261001	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.388448061963	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.650119164937	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.790269699833	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.446802439458	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.393115512413	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.364207942039	That will change everything.
0.0	0.627523527146	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.383557819235	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.216842842362	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.336714413479	We're running.
0.0	0.350555316191	I don't like that.
0.0	0.431544798994	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.250760714042	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.482550155278	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.235889527601	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.481673310032	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.482034867732	We are at 90 percent coverage.
1.0	0.742729943957	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.349455626248	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.363503411096	But I was born here.
0.0	0.748848606224	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.530970164813	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.32030138059	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.508594917416	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.371261339657	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.505845249875	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.257798202773	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
1.0	0.000415357536062	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.402459626285	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.00541386040794	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.319785848119	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.412883500608	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.541918510241	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.466731822951	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.413022617173	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.346278558723	Thank you.
0.0	0.662063011319	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.415157250339	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.411888447843	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.871989367231	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.4075911925	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.308168726465	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.428021913637	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.373634067747	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.644777040541	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.345221139205	They know.
0.0	0.345743070677	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.427718752493	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.537323768386	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.35006092664	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.37141367813	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.353410633106	You know why three?
0.0	0.337978894671	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.567586320866	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.430101597352	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.295866282163	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.338919015666	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.408431797897	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.36940309615	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
1.0	0.451464724626	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.627463773928	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.420156649242	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.382265804409	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.419900055512	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.369081062447	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.00100451747676	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.353874213584	slot.
0.0	0.391703086419	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.358766612426	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.670290578554	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.364673790996	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.429511469059	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.417656647636	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.278952967382	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.354084126934	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.465385052716	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.37174651638	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.447665177223	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.368765460886	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.385180440377	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.438304062958	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.489216406107	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.515347356323	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.288953429763	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.401133062989	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.357887088801	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.38426566696	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.393350193553	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.673777888626	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.481253706669	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.533371289181	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.440136841296	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.237318785192	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.396023448324	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.0315215867275	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.344117439655	OK?
0.0	0.338727441632	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.676370753841	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.366301546871	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.152372861881	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
1.0	0.44467157886	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.371656588951	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.38284814675	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.34165129489	You know that.
0.0	0.702231294024	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.382508753698	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.408008792261	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.983442990784	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.368288738878	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.37430533237	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.397982180103	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.353513389561	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.376572711788	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.833322421399	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.483049823258	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.778481767038	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.531537441055	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.399160190341	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.302802574081	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.322398019453	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.347873428602	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.456531355914	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.45438995388	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.270217134274	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.160098239784	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.383304292137	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.439559917402	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.346250869158	...Thank you.
0.0	0.344117439655	OK?
1.0	0.575909043124	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.416636472304	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.349336479242	John?
0.0	0.418906633948	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.387858022197	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.37434611832	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.185270737865	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.430824029174	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.361843860773	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.430466467759	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.197942998205	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.448790448479	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.314046179658	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.321167078061	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.341270613358	And why?
0.0	0.385879475783	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.433271652825	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.356720641645	Big difference.
0.0	0.380983730722	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.662669492451	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.406074523311	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.877999777242	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.23384797821	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.295525776808	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
1.0	0.820132708038	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.360363641827	That's good.
0.0	0.538295192607	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.360181141472	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.530023216882	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.416972044627	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.469827057368	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.522052459246	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.345080245759	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.450854006942	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.35542020554	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.34497094281	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.671138991562	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.388381003571	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.363580405694	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.382722328688	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.747620719172	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.248010940718	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.0475407312878	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.383015497709	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.397948950334	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.41854037753	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.413165369444	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.351862716244	It is.
0.0	0.603457606729	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.728264894863	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.523428909377	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.732617268611	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.488275762254	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.399993749515	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.447767247902	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.392538782728	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.379960543891	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.096763567781	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.682608312084	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.210282754672	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.454262259166	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.381771491691	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.576350950935	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.532372060443	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.32131873549	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.676409763931	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.389689108359	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.298714807258	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.353734697944	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.377650657132	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.508688287223	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.699375375598	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.00104811541323	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.344117439655	OK.
0.0	0.305766522512	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.393177904963	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.331779628216	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.880478223604	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.421075030301	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.535230951107	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.217591716022	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.588353720304	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.462633421706	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.944400827852	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.304200180321	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.268265565548	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.448016365426	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.352201596198	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.161589306335	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.462111079231	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.388665401455	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.365136007485	You have to lead.
0.0	0.953686372566	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.366312774399	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.582457323179	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.516462833908	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.439107087649	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.282825481454	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.203094028885	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.396261938745	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.384802320158	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.488305986571	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.682567050023	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.342564459891	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.433340891798	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.39930412502	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.364176961504	Well, I did.
0.0	0.410372054818	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.426257518739	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.300632537866	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
1.0	0.36660549141	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.379601958265	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.384752565781	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.412888228221	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.369364313652	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.394472902738	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.339345458776	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.173338287795	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.377820332781	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.390957649262	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.48886610716	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.744049893811	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.353728480341	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.37352795144	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.142982211507	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.386492997469	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.316984958362	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.509267690823	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.460084623781	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.288554061621	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.872761189695	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.316556479042	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.662793115244	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
1.0	0.867246127685	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.391547307285	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.397212376419	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.530674928824	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.482358253715	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.435534364124	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.355456350736	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.296298789285	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.349792933458	No.
0.0	0.441600525555	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.000899394329478	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.267628487389	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.33551331854	...
1.0	0.974260830558	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.383629026205	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.591587915501	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.277061538542	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.376771607306	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.235490713879	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.581497649596	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.692524653991	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.342978174813	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.419520268439	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.350448358223	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.481986998672	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.489367631623	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.356022496289	Our next president...
0.0	0.534840078847	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.383305968081	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.463444880821	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.203553864	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.371257695691	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.397232440119	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.332476547285	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.265369460344	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.33551331854	...
0.0	0.26997748477	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.149181980154	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.440269122933	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.369893730672	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.413080159822	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.489444401349	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.305607141148	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.380125089554	I have no idea.
0.0	0.173806015463	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.375103856134	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.387163615167	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.364418027897	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.175611793974	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
1.0	0.378162399825	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.392129729849	That's fine.
0.0	0.56746608691	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.335953438236	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.352178155169	I want security.
0.0	0.61351579469	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.365732543368	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.475396678709	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.407005202505	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.477545534413	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.424997576675	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.0387847310702	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.440421584327	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.40558561989	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.45390874816	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.00270062713345	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.

0.0	0.261580845041	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.470977846956	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.962460210515	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.

0.0	0.411767148394	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.410976498647	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.423584543665	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.343778188611	I like that.

0.0	0.446465382818	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.470130342622	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.524877167551	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.583422863526	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.402565698935	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.335160759081	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.45552059757	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.374964392599	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.430332165922	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.694632623611	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.332208110086	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.701488677455	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.53850133082	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.359333274192	And we are not England.
0.0	0.320175492023	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
1.0	0.680208213219	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.892817589918	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.379066062781	What have you got now?
0.0	0.371342661028	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.36692971985	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.294506757958	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.34969461677	I do.
0.0	0.539639028688	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.374891585085	They're a scam.
0.0	0.348230333201	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.404179475989	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.38750388476	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.155385443964	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.444687823223	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.445983097899	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.392688985796	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.446864655361	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.313673571913	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.0615378611615	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.296653842668	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.229231691776	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
1.0	0.424761768485	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.317218167968	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.338032274711	You know why?
0.0	0.332208251073	And you know what?
0.0	0.375605188752	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.220009098536	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.460070959232	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.672395291846	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.532413362605	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.381678407228	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.745167500553	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.363404982099	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.42904617504	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.374289677813	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.990632191007	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.444821364149	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.168789100966	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.346278558723	Thank you.
0.0	0.532841060036	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.482426325774	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.472900215443	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.0132781297163	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.658258019464	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.646136715729	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.174299679229	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.334345713962	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.284085978228	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.340865458398	So we need new leadership -- yes.
1.0	0.480871506814	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.398533340283	Just for the record.
0.0	0.263398486284	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
1.0	0.417642622448	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.34534145499	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.33653084008	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.949933330798	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.56529994207	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.459006769507	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.700731953275	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.321273747629	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.358444945469	You really can't.
0.0	0.815084606621	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.381989686604	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.363165927851	OK, good.
0.0	0.307663523928	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.371615604575	I'm ready.
0.0	0.368832329482	I know every one.
0.0	0.406832475746	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.680831578704	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.372926832005	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.367460528714	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.33364019537	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.370847333328	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.844523927392	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.87970827643	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.673382315949	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.353029405394	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.425071358096	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.512086634103	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.305575444902	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.520841938662	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.416418512398	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.861879742222	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.367299395808	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.371241114075	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.358054353493	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.374909569598	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.443706717846	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.315972996833	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.438321298345	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.

0.0	0.00452419067607	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.452619336982	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.673918626314	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.469940535232	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.223040118639	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.

0.0	0.636868701631	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.927539053264	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.317897242283	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.646852547863	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.267834558053	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.384079369465	I would also just say this.

0.0	0.348394421588	That's my view.
0.0	0.337000483113	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.

0.0	0.0878057952269	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.339073588422	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.

1.0	0.494375627328	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.00750405853591	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.

0.0	0.318627691457	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.439930374721	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.

0.0	0.396248263875	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.336260379709	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.354279997396	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.393977914299	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.109506854439	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.48956617818	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.

0.0	0.401970972361	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.999989120605	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.386162205824	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.173855350593	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.801939232846	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.947116866121	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.474440046132	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.369364313652	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.428409341483	That was before he was running against me.
1.0	0.694411563343	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.587126732208	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.329941637083	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.442687312739	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.425111481173	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.398679970207	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.489390960183	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.336127979354	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.42414372514	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.386949288298	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.91580565417	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.561289646839	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.491256271277	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.367952674979	That's not right.
0.0	0.441597131486	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.393343744551	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.444232226605	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.374316344723	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.330571341662	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.346571454007	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.414385525865	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.729087613924	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
1.0	0.963137443066	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.417514043717	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.347884977414	(LAUGHTER)

0.0	0.236306761102	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.407587271762	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.404978823498	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.345276627996	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.528462347898	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.352394863017	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.028789249618	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.205430470481	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.565464811294	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
1.0	0.633781751006	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.680368851512	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.46167952755	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.473596730893	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.434203231476	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.286741566619	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.451942115655	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.254948531099	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.414818937088	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.518450193844	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.336781521097	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.341069446514	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.419739466866	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.748496745027	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.118750120605	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.597760980012	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.421150754963	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.376549516815	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.359372780851	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.756162308865	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.671905919351	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.392517388147	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.375089244966	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.608911048252	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.5	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.371674407522	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.259746845166	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.378787418139	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.341563215695	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.333737376095	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.363108952385	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.0762429629937	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.403634142837	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.362491598114	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.0908994949711	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.49433784931	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.44909578861	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.196051706605	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.442430542108	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.336209101657	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.00992158475581	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.935599314271	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.135565047432	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.428434798195	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.238479153208	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.423878187131	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.347105706241	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.369630512809	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.346514059186	I can.
0.0	0.389282069981	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.361104474131	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.379129362867	I said no.
0.0	0.353584353541	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.347402504914	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.419620266279	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.69536729788	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.109108762437	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.36304406081	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.986179798037	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.522159948965	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.5	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.301189331113	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.366765673142	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.272698982326	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.420944321993	The planes are older than the pilots.
1.0	0.536175202932	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.640042421428	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.940297871818	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.289680206509	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.346230892074	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.574169487237	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.375318106821	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.164877147112	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.410981369697	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.428833349928	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.356335883216	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.403116396388	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.374614976984	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.357969138907	I love this country.
0.0	0.478920754216	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.251912198413	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
1.0	0.752145464589	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.61109685412	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.488107571215	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.393069378331	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.363085211827	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.388540288611	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.35557033041	I will do that.
0.0	0.380036111483	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.831978614532	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.385310774711	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.627142325437	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
1.0	0.744256023114	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.429106274989	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.333965435895	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...

0.0	0.361242579835	Not bad.
0.0	0.636621595793	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.

0.0	0.654489098359	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.166009011402	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.293784018383	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.25799393032	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.267720919881	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.

0.0	0.0628826662225	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.315954686564	I think you're --
0.0	0.624554386652	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.262916476188	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.332208251073	And you know what?
0.0	0.381884097453	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.250606917576	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.367952674979	That's not right.
0.0	0.407354196827	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.367127818887	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.709552123615	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.360253586973	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.375726797159	I never said that.
0.0	0.456837586527	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.590825707765	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.396827480052	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.00631635227713	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.635043773259	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.28568018712	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.422326259824	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.480005838813	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.434347379603	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.24469760361	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.37860898405	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.647889587455	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.0786614485365	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.372868732199	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.398786099022	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.357303131301	It was.
0.0	0.911795200618	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.489976088219	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.56206038251	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.375237814633	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.27732963089	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.357820653545	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.389238100787	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.517030442326	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.346603082418	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
1.0	0.55254086291	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.36292806139	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.369014103465	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.367840364991	That's what he is.
0.0	0.355307205172	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.416019942357	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.728013028877	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.349792933458	No.
1.0	0.403717854271	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.68857738398	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.344117439655	Yes.
0.0	0.200553789119	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.273348458005	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.513754761295	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.442940973869	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.31169378586	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
1.0	0.572658084775	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.25914107475	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.645365457889	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.398648636	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.178790122803	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.388604491993	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.184512449746	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.536224343506	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.417159150698	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.546114957738	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.344693816682	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.401859189169	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.422762800813	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.464486039405	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.426130797133	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.48430891816	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.284585211026	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.444565953497	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.370964273033	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.57414979503	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.400028482847	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.388841866464	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.37818968042	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.580320093213	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.494602228455	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.363768269745	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.452084986365	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.378439823908	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.382530672263	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.438557939901	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.596310889273	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.552656296044	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.321104652002	You just want to...
0.0	0.372779396223	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.366729397558	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.568466169442	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.470597651003	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.421749130661	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.386174945108	No vision at all.
0.0	0.684000544008	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.322039196189	You find me...
0.0	0.293889512391	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.517425024021	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.399979064066	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.44926170259	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.115276787248	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.553942041853	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.546627622986	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.359386341201	He's wrong.
0.0	0.340150343594	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.96872436104	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.383969374069	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.336913716525	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.858102930049	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.380485290566	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.707327920613	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.373138103791	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
1.0	0.388535738025	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.225578462977	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.5	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.300982071651	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.507938977093	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.290034119944	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.627276872809	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.344117439655	Yeah.
0.0	0.352857776961	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.376332496704	They were wrong.
0.0	0.198765131044	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.367295068279	A terrible sight.
1.0	0.563356445452	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.665233724802	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.520807842529	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.36839924895	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.404079936181	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.353208677807	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.250240656036	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.154409209555	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.485864657523	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.48990068384	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.424469102601	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.394135932493	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.816346487098	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.622985000093	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.537030356645	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.337926545808	I understand.
0.0	0.535232101245	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.355610321641	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.436789158239	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.381006950968	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.366166448394	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.349990945345	Think about it.
0.0	0.454881058556	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.367551439495	She was right.
0.0	0.91696247702	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.392221774304	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.390173076596	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.585633628869	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.936554823533	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.194387832793	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.650207974877	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.441877542188	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
1.0	0.453388627847	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.00237564332488	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.314235077943	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.408676012756	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.280895062954	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.352470801357	Creativity.
0.0	0.298954816287	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.423554437473	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.695770201716	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.48181232147	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.462815202705	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.351667713709	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.283767195687	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.21650536657	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.713411428787	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.343052327871	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.787180274845	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.346981117631	You can have him.
0.0	0.431703025598	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.402267812117	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.421576652753	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.411488785119	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.382768722068	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.367033701914	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.346685097742	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.477787302341	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.181967029017	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.492140042906	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.275063454709	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.55736658979	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.38345876187	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.358290304751	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.0972969453055	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.344117439655	Yes.
0.0	0.109720846512	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.418917235666	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.0544887772072	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.429205880767	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.322419316415	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.33551331854	...
0.0	0.380361299706	...10% flat rate...
1.0	0.364229746119	Very few children.
0.0	0.894629020541	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.341971246302	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.399572576195	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.346278558723	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.285044346508	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.346278558723	Thank you.
0.0	0.469225860825	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.569592429042	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.428393598123	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.330698033498	And...
0.0	0.769678368832	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.421693561831	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.361983085222	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.5	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.576308768951	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.265898444215	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.256763877134	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.362367217252	No, John.
0.0	0.646181760224	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.596940328784	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.605724209103	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.298690506993	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.698573535577	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.233607377758	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.429301786126	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.319695881424	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
1.0	0.389592029731	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.534063517391	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.38354383651	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.794872038443	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.392886210939	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.950232070445	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.859850455608	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.5	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.462664643332	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.431745586601	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.422019904366	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.353112686313	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.532402114232	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.220508835933	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.342502578477	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.670515655614	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.742877800337	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.760645892814	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.393279713893	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.250212492493	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.355816194408	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.423124732274	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.262594624076	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.393161985877	Two points.
0.0	0.406508458833	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.447755777851	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.369415140658	Well, I mean right here.
1.0	0.670290578554	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.364418027897	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.416943945348	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.310711996121	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.21062973607	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.377332057175	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.283600789864	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.406097919309	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.534875752775	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.5	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.345887124035	They understand that there's a national security risk.
1.0	0.460470819907	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.360003392356	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.798869041998	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.363052213111	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.434254897446	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.920717042578	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.195311028503	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.356266826717	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
1.0	0.865749574077	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.383753638381	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.34991053019	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.356513129017	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.346278558723	Thank you.
0.0	0.471279581447	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.344117439655	Yes.
1.0	0.512940682855	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.363415868806	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.633497959784	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
1.0	0.353919079751	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.469362737819	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.302455532964	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.810290414417	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.44181090172	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.594439451808	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.455628570995	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.0998994066098	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.59097467657	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.818944437795	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.678278438013	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.930459006478	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.492629602092	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.359073595791	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.166743659829	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.337638996135	Becky --
0.0	0.302592213264	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.300709120214	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.40059968664	Here's -- here's our plan.

0.0	0.405616889936	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.388729430774	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.5	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.400003434337	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.390055633597	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.473518677997	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.391175461008	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.360504385592	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.403639423517	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.342353537439	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.367645010617	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.334355216104	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.173780917811	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.570105456019	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.35743554906	We have no borders.
1.0	0.723352513344	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.115297941651	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.48606088845	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.361491198752	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.492841438828	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.0717955910937	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.380738628672	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.800712890101	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.432840104485	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.476469646787	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.352139733159	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.177075583638	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.341300225804	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.319237500871	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.24344289535	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.393695255683	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.390894461172	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.394724107748	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
1.0	0.377615989005	They stole it.

0.0	0.455135423461	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.0660037783787	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.417265117804	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.347148237844	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.467057667329	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.247012707936	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.48555514943	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.445590598829	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.38010693763	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.538959972437	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
1.0	0.44879879214	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.360927769481	And for good cause.
0.0	0.215864563206	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.338970968527	You bet they do.
0.0	0.346510896358	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.397703189195	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.576069056912	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.370179648965	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.330792560007	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.991275559551	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.413249058923	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.350755075065	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.563378623296	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.97019284295	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.428620392403	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.419351396116	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.374844899285	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.358638269376	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.357514184766	You're right.
0.0	0.778751983666	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.219590035509	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.397692889793	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.383940053715	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.3427944081	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.333390066224	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.482770402491	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.348978990884	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.419450679014	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.244052084233	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.5	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.362484816534	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.158545865091	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.54049941529	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.405783699689	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.374222503814	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.389623947648	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.485274924129	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.357950920851	I can't do it.
0.0	0.478727679376	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.339138924911	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.486131067845	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.319117261309	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.519975306218	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.33463968391	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.620715402168	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.486523204882	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.424495833249	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.306400013023	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.339183672431	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.511253009647	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.397933456699	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.400976430007	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.273434039817	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.447723828646	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.379783627359	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.619994978527	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.351326867684	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.396046948127	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.542249122418	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.34969461677	You do.
0.0	0.341364632739	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.5	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.440372564718	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.351215369137	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.427575253125	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.615230897173	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.516607388333	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.585043190241	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.5	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.627058488308	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.447699033275	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.387584606098	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.397522625035	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.523073023916	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.549450084907	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.464727830244	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.377218929339	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.552221441304	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.406289770672	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.195926153961	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.345458116914	What should we do?
0.0	0.409921306646	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.438890694775	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.438610578543	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.394267013628	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.375831351427	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.33939496324	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.393814628865	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.551409606329	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.384444805811	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.341510629409	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.24288362211	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.380811713888	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.395296039884	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.470076361243	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.586467925333	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.491484834099	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.43774846756	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.229014638523	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.353872110221	This country is changing.
0.0	0.414862393492	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.354441545745	That's for sure.
0.0	0.391960436708	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
1.0	0.446912973582	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.642362237664	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.768554941131	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.397276233506	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.595671574937	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.0406925515644	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.726466865817	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.433583070423	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.381852072054	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.372529642628	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.0948239580341	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.561222327043	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.401713175087	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.359061162846	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.396154061847	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.531307658792	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.333353393842	I have...
0.0	0.35557033041	I'll say this.
0.0	0.419495958912	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.437531373908	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.198725723086	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.00139472433767	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.310545009116	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.423256195783	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.354837131889	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.368265802848	We were wrong.
0.0	0.243877074805	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.365827018758	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.103870515687	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.385652451781	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.386940844943	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.287332965439	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.409483821164	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.3964776677	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.405175839458	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.352158263054	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.302585117111	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.430668714491	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.553958115935	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.999988210868	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.198735897059	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.317894620658	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.627982511534	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.374296699429	My point is this.
0.0	0.494763935219	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.722803591797	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.362408214159	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.352966774448	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.507888506538	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.417771293986	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
1.0	0.622045832879	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.

0.0	0.34414338813	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.485045240424	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.972844781703	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
1.0	0.637012701821	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.413854588985	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.412694816853	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.372595895154	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.750578379152	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.755914825589	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
1.0	0.593969146193	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.439058846481	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.374139343763	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.373237438204	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.386121055501	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.506224600426	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.356704497518	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.358420006539	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.40446391711	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.431943638457	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.51901912495	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.271937836005	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.701401381247	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.349728388115	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.489435700264	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.37301267299	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.492589945212	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.358102917832	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.396022011664	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.846212972485	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.374180016906	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.424140380395	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.713598731699	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
1.0	0.662291027013	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.513149202895	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.31348743473	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.0831519693666	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.424158034797	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.932124394023	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.543421730739	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.395985293718	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.56531308509	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.347884977414	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.372731884629	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.689832856707	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.316330430574	And guess what?
0.0	0.332208251073	And you know what?
0.0	0.37705433421	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.944803471069	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.309686935856	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.462649357505	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.375172092887	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?

0.0	0.359401999356	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.478571221396	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.356431269136	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.599648278386	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.446892985876	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.351475789564	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.682210366915	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.695950583105	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.331748656606	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.4191750691	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.448337652496	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.468951831808	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.312878335168	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
1.0	0.612554836354	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.363164007802	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.241655024911	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.362835558295	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.358804214292	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.360434600858	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.5	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.892784804253	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.3886312501	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.372643282816	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.359479427983	He does great.
0.0	0.576708070169	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.428141168294	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.433728100413	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.638113195683	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.470631031052	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.338401465538	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.538225058464	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.322726381047	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.556629363512	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.347467958004	That has not been...
0.0	0.660908816832	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.406263515029	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.389480176744	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.533043081329	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.473438521848	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.486672908735	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.64428904619	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.986081689109	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.466541880247	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.433436956704	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.480374780074	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
1.0	0.614399074019	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.492410184261	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.415658494218	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.415777249073	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.474474572729	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.366229679066	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.109166396819	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.598972219275	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.454931433047	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.310749134562	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.159200497608	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.668892935507	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.328763086048	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.0309483317055	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.471267728851	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.476962371082	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.25261744684	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.327775509438	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.332208251073	And you know what?
0.0	0.482030764007	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.654474895763	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.46356185811	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.56591718709	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.582743362026	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.386134420877	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.344117439655	Okay.
0.0	0.403861306105	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.431831353334	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.344117439655	OK?
0.0	0.376387349278	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.268138152472	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.354636180575	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.541438230295	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.513886154887	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.331024584521	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.382561828199	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.35471087927	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.335787255299	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.310877061435	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.38434296083	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.389075071637	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.308419275515	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.448464593317	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.459638916411	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.462925443155	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.381030567322	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.273707840356	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.385203388516	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.613212042857	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.39691346215	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.255971428082	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.430324883502	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.718108426913	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.254452518741	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.545354841838	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.398872175263	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.5	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.49352760163	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.101609210244	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.328482826034	I would just say that...
0.0	0.549131717087	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.382307169981	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.481634085317	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.382066227004	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.454544229307	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.274269894715	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.534697503794	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.349502478299	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.361228776786	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.348116526057	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.656418808019	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.385888526279	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.486936556763	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.381131725194	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.323610522158	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.274519930229	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.330123553912	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.552486318874	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.362862267268	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.404657933969	s entrenched problems head-on.
1.0	0.778211965234	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.549589640862	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.835126614705	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
1.0	0.778612587169	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.409903075246	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.287521769609	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.0792103676343	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.408948474478	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.417453657897	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.358948712703	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.361523487101	We're friends.

0.0	0.171183110673	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.57399778458	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.444998671396	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.456751151468	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.518745346564	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.785908452984	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.441321051098	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.327725069069	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.19792415922	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.403022497421	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.

0.0	0.409452595622	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.458338121306	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.451902549161	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.613441020939	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.384621483771	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.338543773597	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.459323761243	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.208959999176	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.735908523372	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.357735371829	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.103396194371	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.362755445459	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.690758612668	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.407886417556	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.670111242128	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.407402242593	We have been talking about it for decades.
1.0	0.957478759369	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.610732329714	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.372587552703	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.113671507258	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.40033928764	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.617024405373	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.391090658504	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.55816030409	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.956956109332	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.409288510008	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.5	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.494831561082	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.454738503157	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.446426216336	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.34836026004	Can we stop?
0.0	0.274927786678	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.000163417027941	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.269221069564	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.425326386697	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.532077371232	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.5	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.699641619441	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.393801794131	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.403607790667	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.316360069901	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.473472313991	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.892173570788	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.24190677433	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.353978248121	I would change them.
0.0	0.322112776249	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
1.0	0.91500991682	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.448604163412	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.412158667276	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.1554549051	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.465540194798	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.454906842205	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.787403429068	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.0977493642859	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.676409763931	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.0547884262615	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.406097919309	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.408566839715	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.663068116705	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.359799440892	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.5	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.363423964892	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.

0.0	0.439243177048	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.458819596078	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.375077593536	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.587582776416	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.367388864673	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.370054076958	That's right.
0.0	0.360905716706	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
1.0	0.679011941481	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.628118982795	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.38434474526	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.535901458296	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.666636670016	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.337966033935	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.378809025332	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.540871203836	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.

0.0	0.00010562947235	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.

0.0	0.377469291285	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.38217950488	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.154788383969	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.467683874403	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.450191069397	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.

0.0	0.416457509234	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.362995270441	But we stuck to our message.

0.0	0.469124443825	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.125785606196	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.370240069658	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.442597555998	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.

0.0	0.460108644702	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.368547953659	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.867988675938	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.

0.0	0.352728617466	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.

0.0	0.280216301395	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.431380876058	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.331877830516	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.94035305352	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.37816358978	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.236930968901	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.

0.0	0.638513801152	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.

0.0	0.492990520167	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.346278558723	Thank you.
0.0	0.367537526654	We actually did it.
0.0	0.216208136098	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.

0.0	0.348933055145	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.330698033498	But...
0.0	0.34658509044	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.598889913954	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.472368029612	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.292158890935	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.361084082966	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.455328693385	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.620715402168	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.300477474213	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.367952674979	That is not right.
0.0	0.396178886086	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.352547945273	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.448554559211	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.42126582425	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.213061503827	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.274453343442	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.413879610562	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.33753774105	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.356022999331	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.368963004658	They're a scam.
0.0	0.760788119687	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.471141788623	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.396352148935	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.360675032945	On welfare.
0.0	0.770897513809	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.260642823928	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.340647248685	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.411737701582	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.348620712373	Divide that out.
0.0	0.35010630051	How do I know this?
0.0	0.351191698604	In addition to that...
0.0	0.355789847663	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.662027433979	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.389395571955	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.562858614684	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.781237527409	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.460314786119	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.33639765319	Again...
0.0	0.376338145149	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.0693351043908	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.625607200469	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.355233640513	How great is that?
0.0	0.484853356183	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.609467772061	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.379130440325	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.328492702988	No, it's true.
0.0	0.540625512535	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.610972426212	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.38483506329	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.487015392154	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.662403281433	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.376363659231	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.411228420253	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.385165456391	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.347482090216	Ever.
0.0	0.379822111355	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.348919241256	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.142930289656	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.360724528527	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.279565680839	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.374996712131	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.446894509814	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.434190386459	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
1.0	0.478236094407	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.395404885715	It's good to be with you.
1.0	0.783193758804	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.365885509657	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.406129466093	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.346278558723	Thank you.
0.0	0.629796854436	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.368047198641	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.403610279386	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.467845887018	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.382378596443	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.474257920637	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.176918523876	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.38676675573	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.340007461976	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.5	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.332904714803	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.413747644225	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.171724251591	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.407188792729	That is our government today.
0.0	0.26717723958	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.413708956884	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.531677443331	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.562683612908	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.471170721033	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.320178685705	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.403367768686	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.327725069069	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.369364313652	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.36271478144	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.561817213944	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.339448720206	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.343726743422	So you know what?
0.0	0.346278558723	Thank you.
0.0	0.3936754338	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.316976350381	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.541273471081	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.396984157753	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.471954924182	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.240444541855	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.834845673345	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.77889954526	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.558234389877	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.31849673519	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.344995302609	Wait for what?
0.0	0.332219719175	It's true.
0.0	0.26137806803	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.3790497685	That never works.
0.0	0.63635487538	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.2512712256	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.292045923158	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
