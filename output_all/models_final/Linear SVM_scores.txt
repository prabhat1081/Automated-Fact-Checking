0.0	0.45029443452	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.415987780186	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.257705863384	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.322515868543	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.418699252368	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.112392640396	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.353688023919	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.413838572217	Right.
0.0	0.405938323727	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.356875002147	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.363858486257	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.41617576176	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.359019894948	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.493282560255	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.449781531427	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.274269297528	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.36472138185	And the reason -- and the reason...
1.0	0.573062922037	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.341627974706	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.362888221384	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.279841926352	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.315600372907	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.313316782297	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.30159754283	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.413838572217	Right.
0.0	0.190319766641	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.281710728504	Came out great.
0.0	0.266585315867	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.554238939338	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.53067804011	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.219688843092	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.386263947029	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.418564636878	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.280353306146	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.375730221808	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.32026654923	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
1.0	0.451913935147	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.420589232127	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.378741996803	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.399396819561	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.365514807031	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.279502023014	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.437411927808	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.466664533876	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.369780711609	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.287947514793	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.435140881603	And, we said no.
0.0	0.214803981663	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.733813620797	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.558492538354	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.526268509034	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.448526866823	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.447765882759	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.369964147937	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.434902732876	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.229477886434	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.449079498775	It goes away.
0.0	0.471555833779	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.624733827773	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.575042998643	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.244167960524	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.467165385972	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.414518891409	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.376272635775	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.364292622669	...before I go.
0.0	0.400866264578	Alright.
0.0	0.2950318312	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.314959055489	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.521797070116	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.242611042034	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.478515670422	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
1.0	0.318308357874	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.369207224467	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.294375352933	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.346624024522	Why is that?
0.0	0.388271336565	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.210938162922	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
1.0	0.809245643805	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.297914901136	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.491926168985	(inaudible).
0.0	0.481993357137	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.38116620951	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.306532212924	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.568066605601	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.458954314244	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.308302123408	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.332475669908	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.205382032269	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.362793960234	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.466558644567	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.593444459613	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.468602222652	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.592998323578	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.448382310472	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.58428261204	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.384150014672	I would change them.
0.0	0.31670383182	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.408294029347	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.350086028315	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.161584566877	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.364387624803	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
1.0	0.782022454046	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.451524123778	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.52138473173	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.698438712575	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.172863764099	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.194356859691	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.48897206987	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.197053939085	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.453958488183	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.329337723042	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.464744724017	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.298803394616	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.424044828264	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.519417070698	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.641124102615	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.288242083615	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.424835837928	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.5	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.411327984709	No.
0.0	0.299763659857	I think you're --
0.0	0.404809480841	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.395404629053	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.393976535541	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.285798549826	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.269140641521	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.408919818899	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.164296013785	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.419720263077	I can.
0.0	0.351470451568	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.558258769317	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.398941840571	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.351777851972	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.290950807534	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.5	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.374185050524	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.482255088974	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.181974528289	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.404654180124	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.567552020821	I never said that.
0.0	0.319099425765	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.470050949841	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.241261981766	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.41209101831	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.143063689585	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.135586235142	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.603851582344	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.483224961867	I said no.
0.0	0.545028154096	Secretary of state for four years.
1.0	0.531304769207	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.297398371799	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.481860457245	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.552982107676	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.465942361016	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.557087604733	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.307862294325	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.333300149758	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.58471501634	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.517226982471	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.43819971837	That's right.
0.0	0.551065194666	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.337227681083	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.307984492437	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.356215994372	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.361646785992	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.445076618561	I would just say that...
0.0	0.318083642272	You just want to...
0.0	0.54056754489	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.413289127799	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.409456175876	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.290369601206	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.736691665301	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.472033164012	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.615342028603	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.472649585388	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.459442794606	It is a false choice.
1.0	0.751838084333	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.372330541741	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.336597387654	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.346620830518	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.580869417841	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.458128452751	We were wrong.
0.0	0.396225513248	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.290849326152	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.517283969475	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.254946095943	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.381379571912	That is...
0.0	0.680038977785	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.535230437235	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.464508861914	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.266638736661	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.287266746739	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.434292201276	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.409909112107	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.333763009831	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.236466774391	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.369748540374	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.378434781344	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
1.0	0.701400636367	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.44511340351	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.570536840466	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.230629968515	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.478836521568	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.

0.0	0.447698924977	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.626045442253	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.515391993565	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.

0.0	0.412122990365	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.432779422417	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.262224799309	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.540690128894	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.362308832011	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.305500873746	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.296266234761	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.

0.0	0.440662207913	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.284617878235	It's true.
0.0	0.426661589404	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.466679529741	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.422603895171	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.288773496238	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.400902197725	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.531224905309	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.434644032835	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.394490041325	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.308501899509	John, could I follow up on this?

0.0	0.421562686749	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.756580018602	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?

1.0	0.519892662522	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.214327193099	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.372282947444	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.433651812205	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.517266126562	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.5	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.374443062787	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.452579290803	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
1.0	0.578045080352	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.

0.0	0.429430911588	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.381657265217	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.494440380415	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.507270026363	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.439356472892	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.522746062047	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.528685228808	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.534384277439	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.5	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.431094938308	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
1.0	0.7048350829	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.305033956375	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.341008566674	...John...
0.0	0.293465342595	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.442044923625	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.4710643839	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.445985597302	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.467154267344	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.476815273979	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.253165499309	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.411327984709	No.
0.0	0.520107707561	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.417217665413	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.5	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.633112647231	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.509090595448	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.389303022551	They know.
0.0	0.569676846263	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.442474567051	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.267888657494	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.481288892898	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.589885201082	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.431703307606	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.413838572217	Ever.

0.0	0.454523297797	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.304590506767	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.348962902817	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.311655424759	...
0.0	0.336687200069	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.420317207586	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.608899815842	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.452921988289	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.836867725023	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.364960945388	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.709303348194	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.281400916698	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.47739703901	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.510723393112	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.669738996193	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.4868124638	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.311655424759	...
0.0	0.56501968606	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.407111381671	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.467248379892	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
1.0	0.810500129822	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.35034544923	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.5	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.435571457999	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.625086706221	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.5	But I was born here.

0.0	0.240071393073	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.231197754862	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.290079819909	So we need to get on a different mindset.
1.0	0.592073598504	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.392151086321	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.549612038635	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.267571771994	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.781093787914	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
1.0	0.579787543682	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.200139522078	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.521156589709	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.295826722118	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.568689926629	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.395870437964	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.532846573503	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.291586410567	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.206999024861	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.539177302317	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.331892040759	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.212644007585	In all due respect...
0.0	0.393979224366	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.274849546613	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.584563911853	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.245394603177	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.463497735298	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.401152795328	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.659999188737	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.472864073479	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.443318976581	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.412803285686	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.408715025496	You're welcome.
0.0	0.481620910107	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.422917384149	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.333204045592	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.492240088349	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.382922424279	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.393012111068	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.440687727599	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.299907648603	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.845730140248	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.238092792951	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.563568621739	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.612054598462	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.513601136161	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.362800607668	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.385299048431	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.447797701658	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.485862884875	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.315977444263	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.695544375821	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.296966781622	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.457206692663	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.582454813197	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.297091198821	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.28307720919	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.518253169294	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.522245429435	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.484362327805	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.470112937091	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.368949499989	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.437994697765	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.418423922968	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.428064179108	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.440719437946	Yeah, he said everybody.
1.0	0.441892870075	Very few children.
0.0	0.348170320506	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.398098830194	So you might not.
0.0	0.378575360297	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.336531948429	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.382563467348	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.309732736062	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.41988374672	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.666273744046	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.377517430814	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.435389465755	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.432477167848	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.23025374611	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.523434382452	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.533811244929	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.45674333687	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.43657613925	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.284786120322	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.379574316896	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.0856201975051	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.195142088845	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.5663542823	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.368568578051	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.555542381107	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.530302483995	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.410534335392	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.429155725905	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.5	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.432718903655	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.22115647139	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.149581673175	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.7095665709	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.230792145652	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.580628953096	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0639514622868	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.382046722788	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.0985308963927	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.508877500364	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.123708881381	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.453993709185	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.385933664196	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.491628039374	It takes away discretion from judges.
1.0	0.595908150878	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.489385441708	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
1.0	0.461508775834	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.528104567871	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.459373519334	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.463837259547	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.471433456344	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.578497196235	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.771251024832	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.652120946609	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.31117237583	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.22384564407	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.331594859369	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.205872219016	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.45124529991	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.317144397893	I like that.
0.0	0.44404180054	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.0978919305244	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.300908864432	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.425876267906	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.352042818246	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.404071569088	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.562790718039	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.571056794291	On welfare.
0.0	0.126241741651	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.343125729794	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.180710443663	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.34118151729	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.368158048883	There's something going on and it's bad.
1.0	0.805983102476	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.312677870508	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.517395610055	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.215815246401	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
1.0	0.437102835155	That's wrong.
0.0	0.571860436397	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.485545837268	He wasn't my senator.
1.0	0.529493019402	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.312780462025	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.334886099954	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.353726710484	I want security.
0.0	0.634851804868	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
1.0	0.567756601884	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.679439929053	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.375462549071	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.377593593142	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.418681225362	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.591766946345	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.553878041326	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.548908825449	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.687460304321	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.613462075512	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.453609609713	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.546339197783	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.395170474226	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.303603972861	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.302194260206	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.427600270303	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.389762589247	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.469186890999	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.491253613914	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.420613006611	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.317213252282	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.346356616436	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.537904348473	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.457926331749	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.396046829697	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.752429687538	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.229789546014	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.513368987406	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.28571389446	...No, sir...
0.0	0.629561968613	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.539883926118	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.813538381408	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.299668194994	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.591743415232	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.569429080718	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.475119976774	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.299791932743	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.420176557383	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.20756308808	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.215054832906	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.138400408335	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.49473609344	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.408266794152	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.510737336136	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.474144808923	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.370544712791	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
1.0	0.78030458199	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.342628380057	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.463262743709	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.528179441231	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.626779891568	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.224426425243	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.159617602418	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.442811932238	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.29361601677	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.42592832831	I have.
0.0	0.465913692434	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.479982699446	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.432755364375	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.338449544019	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
1.0	0.449725645768	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.365451624008	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.4372045493	We need sound money.
0.0	0.403196884222	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.531629025484	The world has changed.
0.0	0.408304000977	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.465559053924	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.376890155257	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.558496580267	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.515984078814	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.594881457064	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.280441788793	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.560416295618	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.388897448104	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.366578457935	And so do I.
0.0	0.322174075567	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.524647327284	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.396162305353	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.699312774073	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.316729560895	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.0806933872493	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.511905795752	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.346235831141	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.637319110031	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
1.0	0.61198096731	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.405594959164	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.648250258648	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.416193742002	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.807869786214	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.214131164987	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.356960311809	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.532618683314	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.476914647185	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.706689657	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.262456967373	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.288055558273	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.523319481398	Atlantic City has gone bad.
1.0	0.69066995116	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.294349562626	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.203001975235	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.397314072954	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.571142338149	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.205110049617	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.223185755101	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.678810916198	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.398417330324	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.489231393416	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.61632216489	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.668097171593	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.371974134448	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.386205336848	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.632737569127	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.321846462334	And God bless America.
0.0	0.456942229336	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.668279705322	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.468049553851	I was the architect.
0.0	0.274113831367	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.433470070469	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.231052964551	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
1.0	0.59998442973	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.651970281969	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.528055802757	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.633667043025	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.54347782057	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.589816202206	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.298613992039	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.456399035192	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.490958798761	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.514060104788	I actually have a plan.

0.0	0.452463417306	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.329806580825	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.368579242036	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.634073838884	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.395934790193	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.456275117383	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.51301381482	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.236723093587	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.453764777253	You have to lead.
0.0	0.39223559447	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.450356924738	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.493706734428	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.48368985709	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.468125809424	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.316853157079	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.534297092994	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.3776712152	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.512233950297	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.456061616074	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.679004169631	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.236383176896	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.622532761061	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.302995521174	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.451031757483	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.628806213386	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.366703057062	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.283050694453	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.111242214364	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.382216999612	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.283039817621	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.453312619744	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.329952845382	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.483926683978	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.380349613477	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.449695443362	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.595249242131	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.483880930461	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.57825071478	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.676913905829	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.387443543627	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.276265909383	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.239699039219	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.444885580431	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.436146103388	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.0945119030075	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.479024719407	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.584177330821	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.

0.0	0.5	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.462099526872	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.375950447865	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.335954540173	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.357503495019	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.465390018481	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.252034090952	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.468995544444	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
1.0	0.520234739273	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.555660186358	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.404755883165	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.587794976654	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.452140370765	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.430441062396	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.589031344777	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.384515502143	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.529598346122	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.39692380303	Not -- not on that, no.
1.0	0.642724838395	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.10292814729	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.476601458017	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.414557657043	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.433794025545	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.286789370497	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.180520688744	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.493001019804	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.242351827239	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.687267425142	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.527796155754	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
1.0	0.865732947884	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.383416798638	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.421502299617	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.464378024591	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.114985182204	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.420614590609	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.804741155581	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.518035091821	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.420400755781	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.311655424759	...
0.0	0.481361656979	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.541159198316	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.346421535164	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.421716315593	We need security.
0.0	0.537043149891	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.723081078521	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
1.0	0.434045585779	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.623662517268	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.513691158834	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.871872631805	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.618824548497	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.422381414822	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.409373926586	She said the truth.
0.0	0.301699248721	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.450443146308	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.45190809643	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.460503311206	Of course not.
0.0	0.320801513219	It works very, very well.
1.0	0.532779620861	They stole it.
0.0	0.653954594438	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.418380600749	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.29375016702	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.660446715847	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.293093496922	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.491011089331	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.473017598141	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.776897447807	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.424704771394	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.323528165757	He undermines it.
0.0	0.4008906751	How about this?
0.0	0.297960393215	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.61632870368	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.422670731089	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.468961135393	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.365254988145	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.209198164755	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.425161246492	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.13893577494	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.352163179013	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.469323698196	I have no idea.
0.0	0.375599572921	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.383518108281	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.5	White people?
0.0	0.318446555401	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.486574879793	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.247065455449	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.23612697179	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.490515714623	That's fine.
0.0	0.318910438486	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.233860290432	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.482594747423	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.525512365977	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.429515219569	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.365663829917	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.382850280509	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.432318175681	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.386428611229	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.392829106358	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.335597248372	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.469285990252	That's not true.
0.0	0.491882522252	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.353659567907	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.542545085173	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.384537165163	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.607006578633	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.540431573708	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.423620212865	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.481618683731	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.176932874177	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.783909458	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.402182961733	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.546303927781	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.37207315407	Think about that.
0.0	0.414399383073	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.121726885803	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.196191168694	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.317516385099	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.121905424854	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.431331692268	We're running.
0.0	0.423717019233	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.460649692292	But I would add this.
0.0	0.407052935564	That's good.
0.0	0.337721842998	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.438033197542	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.777443701439	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.215386941228	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.51443943152	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.617124162718	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.216352559607	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.521620723215	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.255111118231	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.316205176025	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.355865622676	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.251950093658	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.261854277754	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.369657446505	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.218667766747	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.414016783294	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.682199464025	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.667280924107	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.331028669838	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.402239056536	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.558682009239	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.588870689014	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.600598419233	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.341584966858	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.359699755252	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.357202608878	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.426297007538	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.331406150364	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.614519673079	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.541462204797	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.505651543107	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.642014470203	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.368557773569	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.563440672485	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.534130577454	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.285034031372	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.443658917957	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.608159552468	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.512506688516	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.51217610278	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.430904476046	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.492828943875	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.512817997468	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.414040176942	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.440497705558	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.459100794134	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.470553375868	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.341094520242	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.276263402912	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.21296694865	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.457240624049	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.471793393983	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.596523487839	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.461859808547	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.311012318776	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.23702669021	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.454029513207	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.604858128222	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.292117497372	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.515495949677	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.563613562293	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.461380926603	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.55894494144	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.371111582123	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.0761636248027	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.606202930215	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.506263489219	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.320748769727	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.397852931547	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.453732862341	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.631050078968	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.410523804165	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.246607999189	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.451201290546	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.380669104742	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.641627708435	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.393863280516	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.42624760386	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.549975590996	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.347606997825	How do I know this?
1.0	0.583712226576	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.576652508051	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.432808147213	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.5	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.451260969145	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.362661074299	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.256048123926	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.379768037827	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.416494225783	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.31529944036	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.223505759839	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.424751049867	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.523197647687	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.375996050877	Yeah.
0.0	0.353910735111	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.37499430823	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.34762788883	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.274588394392	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.627983352896	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.522163273968	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.564125530093	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.347142871223	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.482898222814	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.646643401262	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.380857215125	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.547088225956	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.353341621382	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.789665477263	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.467542405493	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.494570599735	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.462431148782	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
1.0	0.536850302055	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.54433747057	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.526509011702	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.143594616777	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.527596259329	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.515918796852	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.0445478604812	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.290727969295	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.169984506515	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.700508075757	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.441391872292	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.682648326449	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.244188076497	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.448750565423	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.191286360414	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.321002029713	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.309827935673	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.570569558807	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.477974119418	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.439581660454	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.547336313211	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.175527570974	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.258925008011	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.470434318875	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.333971104721	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.46697352295	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.548197548772	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.348384121688	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.33337697616	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.41097304583	My point is this.
0.0	0.256064309154	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.332510800848	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.455666978381	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.493065362396	I've done it.
0.0	0.709386384542	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.538990500591	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.292304716409	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.357022256779	I understand.
0.0	0.652854493974	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.453926803673	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.280669013399	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.382317203604	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.555616701471	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.293165237513	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.456229894535	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.484224890446	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.222977801009	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.45046747925	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.703038776235	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.370669679212	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.615047615696	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.54986005558	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.282938205113	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.464828563697	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
1.0	0.536219284744	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.618900558947	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.207443216058	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.669306222573	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.289191914055	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.477268958028	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.287627084362	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.463946882264	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.509969688413	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.530587798656	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.456567311955	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.485778093161	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.394737441411	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.554450986073	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.385236741973	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.417616257214	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.535486083579	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.5	That's the difference.
0.0	0.390748510446	No, John.
0.0	0.531482651974	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.522096414915	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.460104555665	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.427320927141	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.68250396365	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.418992128017	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.393665609385	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.534218734427	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.114239411749	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.461313081396	But here's the best solution of all.
1.0	0.463037559068	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.420282176954	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.491846902968	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.26891143173	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.284963025608	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.5	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.316275676991	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.332815376344	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.436506823794	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.876192282358	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.524962847642	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.400626769176	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.398197030417	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.747372494746	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.554252404612	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.434860497406	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
1.0	0.61199559464	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.466441117707	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.361902893861	No -- no...
0.0	0.371928023166	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.389213073148	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.539709664712	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.5	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.383953159266	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.592262950423	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.399352398843	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.527086769952	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.436999675842	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.410340028067	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.425641223053	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.554996462151	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.43899522123	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.347381385725	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.389227407959	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.536757184771	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.482815691384	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.419340227632	And we are not England.
0.0	0.424241300493	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.601170608743	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.42226669709	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.397126053983	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
1.0	0.530032673513	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.398497610546	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.359787692521	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.514115153799	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.686393574432	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.412414834765	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.419691401719	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.427922488962	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.516425009215	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.296410509384	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.451306344537	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.916403435964	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.434554174593	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.419356219096	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.464933034601	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.573599174576	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.490811532298	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.00824199028592	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.400370143549	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.45702221946	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.564902216372	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.414250266686	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.351388796902	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.482454644414	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.490204481118	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.536062821102	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.40493319773	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.602192486373	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.285553928339	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.616049443269	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.369861322084	We're friends.
0.0	0.231787941416	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.297415689508	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.285490487986	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.362965831155	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.430197274253	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.229245720705	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.426665157994	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.676367529001	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.429966695012	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.436052431931	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.507498384022	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.451398644785	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.351275542917	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.401474329881	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.407003644511	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.36054276138	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.400866264578	John.
0.0	0.49279422101	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
1.0	0.830720238325	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.218994782075	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.393961079744	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.154181667482	But also, I can't fake anger.
1.0	0.493568640011	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.264353381122	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.423043509124	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.359639813727	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.575410987	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.374352254504	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.489197172284	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.661568478693	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.41971308346	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.305331536389	We hear a lot of good plans.
1.0	0.872287431817	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.254394314707	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.423961770004	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.614898485518	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.411168224496	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.567552020821	I never said that.
0.0	0.592764648088	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
1.0	0.780741907952	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.181453477734	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.365882318492	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.416824981864	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.38110237778	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.464706249061	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.617408529989	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.473823236859	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.281930533975	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.375408690755	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.392271875573	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.244984827199	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.42355051332	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.411880762708	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.411915351192	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.459755891446	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.352705213559	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.364088399604	Maria...
0.0	0.396035727054	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.509986025688	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.682199464025	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.538707729094	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.395119269693	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.375457731055	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.448204059403	Not bad.
0.0	0.242726717251	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.34483034689	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.505160521506	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.719263595206	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.289695990715	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.709224311053	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.576036594194	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.506992261598	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.327693687255	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.413370271135	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.455792352525	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.331324875881	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.451477619704	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.331172238898	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.449336557497	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.677019069982	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.388107454581	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.269632252852	I'm happy to have him tonight...
1.0	0.515915384508	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.492707944992	That is important.
1.0	0.386690302835	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.814698148159	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.25758918828	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.461894173385	But bottom line is: The president is right.
1.0	0.707671754859	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.412038568022	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.527213094824	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.672937141942	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.534574277446	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.546318402305	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.439442300712	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.464650509286	I know every one.
0.0	0.477462265184	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.355834262875	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
1.0	0.68243877156	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.4264704908	I don't care.
0.0	0.569833301404	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.320573811933	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.460142399227	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.465913692434	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.337568244123	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.402416148139	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.322885646372	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.363997791624	This will end.
0.0	0.432493111707	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.509146716828	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.766343694598	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.728497117915	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.471190348502	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.38924859947	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.5	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.34555345061	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.638555520919	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.681790446755	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.5	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.246933973267	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.5	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.639278432966	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.505240198664	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.340965090728	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.563122968565	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.310335634558	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.329923002322	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.571620775346	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.665024271025	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.570035491558	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.389571135252	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.358685121918	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.331017180693	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.462368451496	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.384998616107	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.450352876745	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.244554217971	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.360138009098	I've laid out...
0.0	0.461800956408	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
1.0	0.515863928848	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.355842459895	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.37714559959	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.450558761	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.696424675935	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.589556613289	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.272938279757	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.319193816692	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.636506367518	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.452270480366	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.673110574023	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.620161332244	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.295078994963	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.448505943051	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.373075693811	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.313370190335	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.49016355441	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.7082843334	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.421905104698	He's wrong.
0.0	0.393349014346	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.22978870847	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.393393487858	That's for sure.
0.0	0.563546760601	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
1.0	0.752821535859	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.366975257197	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.29537237812	The number of women --
0.0	0.485852564638	She was right.
0.0	0.522881702298	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.507344489172	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.447068345572	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.492997387441	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
1.0	0.473359833472	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.441270463357	You're right.
0.0	0.585445814433	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.585645109223	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.42592832831	We do.
0.0	0.518941808051	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.389356976757	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.334826688001	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.430679988146	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.411017773089	No their not.
0.0	0.460766443655	Let me conclude by just saying this.
1.0	0.630835761492	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.221613013511	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.39254265664	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.359741891256	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.546160789514	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.435043970074	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.312941904491	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.391757526355	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.489371016427	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.339175925844	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.233040493459	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.465314124959	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.368699479501	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.389084336721	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.446852756006	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
1.0	0.491602383417	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.483048765703	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.578517282151	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.5	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.489092372652	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.451663379128	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.360347879216	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.391393589792	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.424741963747	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.179196744725	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.513822387608	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.637728067306	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.275748007904	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.570017321906	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.285274249687	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.476539316915	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.376128678199	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.5	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.380117272939	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.36374635646	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.598212104625	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.560463041185	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.615929550579	They're a scam.
0.0	0.411375912201	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.333750707355	We have no borders.
0.0	0.412626000385	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.228071596732	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.404473451985	I would change them.
0.0	0.429348567078	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.572449900348	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.413090838617	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.261176299624	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.523037641644	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.286548950912	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.48831943122	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.359964688781	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.371598111491	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.439426847155	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.340944309667	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.401586224693	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.617331192521	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.277072546211	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.249961037506	But if you look at working men and women.
1.0	0.444744933449	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.312236766684	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.466154650029	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.439362927511	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.417898218031	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.336597387654	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.619936676804	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.452421427435	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.44255496456	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.47000941708	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.532640182899	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.416011033787	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.487634093205	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.356826572045	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.192236637757	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.527108058556	And you know what?
0.0	0.150837515657	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.360270975774	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.475693532651	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.394656239495	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.338521992648	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.607752178691	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.510709854855	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.284138583703	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
1.0	0.558427711705	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.255178040869	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.22708907499	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
1.0	0.564982674614	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.156829703125	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.339837391564	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.514088049192	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.527065079631	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.240348850105	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.370466770776	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.29422639766	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.544115822588	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.305278097451	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.5	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.41857210557	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.47882847132	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.27624641466	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.540199961386	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.204448080123	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.345433916431	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.320110673512	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.332680826309	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.41771474533	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.553997905367	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.440935627579	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.469514993546	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.540898021333	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.367611375014	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.0795080834275	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.543837504162	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.478596610466	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.169972512522	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.337271735876	What should we do?
0.0	0.403100107708	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.433827862507	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.366142973392	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.347630177561	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.410090763511	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.552398650432	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.46994223662	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.573942566708	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.489449300011	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.34494778129	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.386482325272	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.488273157008	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.490184677344	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.147525338097	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.5	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.442447096617	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.299945510189	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.170005062899	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.443307658423	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.54000240705	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.341008566674	...Chris...
0.0	0.456530376237	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.438551104537	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.224193387284	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.414020453303	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.4707378458	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.355887360409	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.352015209673	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.163213598081	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.395567460271	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.594955808961	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.414246567181	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.464774920237	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.640856036338	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.485852564638	I didn't.
0.0	0.340210934906	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.465113758932	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.5	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.658453943687	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.0789882142933	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.153314299351	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.444796764591	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.761628101861	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.541198939086	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.329710052402	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.600382226231	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.542151944398	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.51862881782	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.409966235977	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.392207802703	About Medicare?
0.0	0.671949974576	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.429451819437	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.25198152609	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.794445535118	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.421376951586	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.56157191881	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?

0.0	0.209997644648	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.

0.0	0.358325963758	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.413838572217	Right.
0.0	0.477129065562	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.674766684762	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.790496808357	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.530636644056	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.305237552445	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.306998724563	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.388620980971	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.392817727128	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.395203137296	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.

0.0	0.214948467111	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.475303305171	We actually did it.
0.0	0.745358639352	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.512428455186	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.180520688744	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.400832168397	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.281080669572	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.238080179041	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.422166856526	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.362602663441	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.375011398995	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.5	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.581981605178	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.428305789954	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.381036309766	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.190064278587	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.463129126342	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.510649945814	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.251189657898	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.508963739651	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.556436192895	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.352344883265	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.354133132527	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.306982622212	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.685302922982	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.463946060751	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.399518680598	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.347884706549	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.416510586813	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.460585565621	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.444611747473	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.350236831774	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.401998997758	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.277037729677	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.570567737552	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.54036928523	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.509489155058	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.373166723228	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.729901390242	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.528307425356	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.526389662997	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.63918082427	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.309675217546	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.299530217845	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.450873407424	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.368236780026	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.313316782297	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.629995749466	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.252025387032	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.796464712101	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
1.0	0.735037621115	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.323104177127	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.5	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.274847694277	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.5	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.5	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
1.0	0.528749633409	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.527108058556	And you know what?
0.0	0.327362203689	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.489346288654	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.346960884942	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.170902933851	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.387831191163	I have...
0.0	0.489495583274	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.48021828567	...income tax...
0.0	0.480910551833	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.23952921626	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.257409496465	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.455760172535	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.436643690402	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.452698270457	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.411932989582	We don't win.
0.0	0.528072614485	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.239765630693	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.341150295524	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.651677174636	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.5	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.641392216452	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.624534278402	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.224047301145	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.408411275762	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.299021238925	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.392901258562	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.422030811635	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.375996050877	OK?
0.0	0.452047393766	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.33397712045	I can't do it.
0.0	0.488628605188	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.441841160006	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.259272861778	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.5	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.571747810146	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.403738908495	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.36991762438	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.576318950554	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.257648295805	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.277699615835	That's my view.
0.0	0.5	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.475437630779	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.454840365903	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.767759630493	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.522427183839	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.681530822413	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.260360510349	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.234084443106	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.244585247468	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.407067522519	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.627176037623	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.157642106075	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.55006475407	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.435073062174	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.393976535541	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.316775042649	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.602079240011	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.756884600105	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.798002245882	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.158661132904	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.355265245055	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.428801761713	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.566748488881	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.259141787985	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.636516080253	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.383967806577	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.33397712045	We can't do it.
1.0	0.805868839774	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.440918038732	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.510250469876	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.388522362311	Do we have answer for that?
1.0	0.456767424429	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.466644476109	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.585742045464	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.59793535127	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.597759112113	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.589739947356	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.444519932257	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.340826287444	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.512248135264	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.475152346131	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.556428533605	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.334705434116	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.467260771421	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.422809192937	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.583007139747	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.107699152678	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.653894201588	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.382106188849	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.35639263192	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.359694785887	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.374153479986	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.368278286062	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.249385669496	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.340963594559	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.505618960574	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.418773680576	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.433615359897	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.648943195669	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.318350806567	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.293791402271	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.455196113724	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.425954373788	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.55013018887	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.449464881264	He does great.
0.0	0.341896033663	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.486203929962	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.5	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.429312251674	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.423440971366	OK, good.
0.0	0.479464001287	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.400038143905	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.508820071804	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.525533542434	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.459375697501	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.536541461404	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.527261361611	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.441283488859	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.442834731507	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.420424969311	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.517860916319	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.153333174627	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.337275913238	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.310027229005	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.466540462197	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.358371147699	But look...
0.0	0.420314513226	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.235842601386	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.417337236475	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.392523356763	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.512149266403	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.572297582277	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.446932543813	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.664136009655	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.676377388901	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.279652849684	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.345387585423	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.427992181617	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.466739196284	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.275219114408	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.411987811981	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.505223035023	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.386073829175	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.3585732403	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.472293044596	to save a company.
0.0	0.473212199972	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.520714696684	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.726601018999	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.375997984474	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.630782980022	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.266532499356	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.226990419091	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.41465921156	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.308625884272	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.421292421837	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.403177057683	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.276679834337	I agree with them.
0.0	0.313275086123	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.775250082283	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.638573173549	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.388837897925	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.656960523019	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.670361052629	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
1.0	0.5	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.294980876673	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.322086617956	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.364648925977	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.436239751462	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.569529021216	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.515918020374	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.377821620232	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.645141785473	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.34501286717	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.427703685923	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.379604584014	I like it.
0.0	0.468562928287	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.387861732002	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.391260361583	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.272005528362	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.399737830039	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.457215235531	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.474649507183	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.397692421535	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.44008774614	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.415569713855	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.355075472697	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.264104945843	This country is changing.
0.0	0.249976480193	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.271108844601	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.312471889782	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.5	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.31640743724	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.406087441422	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.192516933201	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.583349453414	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.35721323189	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.549235730193	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.332036833587	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.426252474634	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.728624801023	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.330221389185	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.519859997954	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.466509944402	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.551392733102	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.514496918503	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.28370364931	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.130853540486	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.0918593527868	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.226574652676	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.388211643864	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.302111863701	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.314283147348	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.505977169643	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.271259114898	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.31379277981	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.376722406424	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.395402838762	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.218083431293	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.291499952579	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.554796874629	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.456567683161	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.329631348791	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.28805593616	We're running.
0.0	0.404364681234	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.247241223051	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.608574106484	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.438866182768	It's a joke.
0.0	0.280658965379	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.306575391832	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.410810729812	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.630421139883	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.5	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.378954921319	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.442650958984	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.480321965829	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.664412735919	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.62422958515	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.471938961226	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.5	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.215680502891	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.464970150537	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.428231070869	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.430224566092	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.5	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.349019755514	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.346819879819	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.570109557701	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.451545815837	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.242474876585	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.536795048595	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.393799717012	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.614190832307	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.457543591574	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.517235203121	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.363163294293	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.367933840296	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.311645804081	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.368501719579	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.364229006284	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.339823987361	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.35709513726	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.550453719423	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.435971048509	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.433575701017	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.248995734925	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.396591802449	You know why?
0.0	0.446046004988	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.340450755309	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.605824876422	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.507536616952	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.311902138292	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.601728944057	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.613553408305	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.258723779782	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.505502618795	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.481879954643	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.376425356659	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.869957538948	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.597523947129	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.378754053574	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.535967248251	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.584149071545	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.30053515326	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.225462993363	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.540625761085	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.491014363264	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.554590477177	But then his poll numbers tanked.
1.0	0.760233099579	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.384675843787	You know that.
0.0	0.166381283848	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.275094409841	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.354138639088	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.489804979376	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.276177819515	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.298751192076	Hey look, he never had a chance.
1.0	0.5	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.564081232067	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.435029065746	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.441270463357	We haven't.
0.0	0.384775204407	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.556292533553	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.530269649013	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.547708132331	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.380041314513	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.356865208424	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.561108317697	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.246015245963	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.5	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.306088543897	Wait for what?
0.0	0.451490182303	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.472965828136	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.446337028531	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.399556873055	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.226664640858	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.218399640738	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.592686155051	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.436053816464	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.507587467073	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.669765997251	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.617838874568	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.210907164275	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.541915252802	Two points.
0.0	0.585862872462	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.375154743608	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.449462275186	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.39399714649	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.434478895145	You looking at me?
0.0	0.560820073661	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
1.0	0.549045400988	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.560193530814	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.386764178307	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.171539223357	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.226971485682	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.321534509906	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.5	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.320102390466	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.311655424759	...
0.0	0.177986691744	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.394911252547	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.450921729115	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.407746045434	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.457744702705	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.241912366147	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.458689854993	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.567795209347	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.163895140678	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.421882898083	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.381236602436	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.41350308934	No vision at all.
1.0	0.488074619133	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.197876668323	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.313324515673	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.173317683453	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.377555457807	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.472201482236	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.547529183781	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.373967436932	These...
0.0	0.331248969801	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.281348256554	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
1.0	0.690016708778	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.452188332777	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.574919930037	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.410336729074	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.384452193177	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.337233643103	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.393002431145	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.190741893225	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.723910619907	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.540691670757	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.284749798534	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.381345002819	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.317184404032	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.306904677856	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.444641075276	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.595263036573	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.548603721675	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.473226340292	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.288713957021	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.415462887096	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.586654819291	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.288636613864	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.381616560942	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.494077263082	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.688244865826	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.350928802184	We don't need that.
0.0	0.390429634189	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.40091233885	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.180689083618	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.489684341492	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.435752334629	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.177590503126	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.615041217228	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.436984994992	I win.
0.0	0.386735576227	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.644922649206	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.231130635166	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.417029975894	Creativity.
0.0	0.456504459958	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
1.0	0.3677463049	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.210446235353	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.273751766263	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.348164080166	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.331799651098	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.516628253832	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
1.0	0.639969774683	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.282042431717	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.342356085415	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.625773460834	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.472752143053	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.579906701438	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.522674168088	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.315598601476	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.335901766821	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.688086424916	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.409784389838	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.284366732988	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.570185505632	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.467808984941	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.491651635551	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.395940811846	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.293854911651	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.457484317311	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.318078150302	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.476736402731	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.5	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.422986884436	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.16274865678	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.613127119532	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.362882375409	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.559193925209	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.5	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.286710990983	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.438594725017	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.521507259688	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.465390018481	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.300123943737	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.25092965844	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.5	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.323605700486	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.225705915279	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.470911311874	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.452209406959	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.341564446509	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.574620456785	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.167169551353	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.412314625902	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.473661701037	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.551525012486	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.217414082243	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.380076685006	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.389989475394	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
1.0	0.618340855912	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.572696483748	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.358025359646	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.27837508304	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.475159767664	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.3428556346	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.46156127824	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.37591195368	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.364407519785	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.555463427707	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.536846122722	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.420555580859	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.460314451635	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.481076107985	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
1.0	0.725750480952	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.540666614943	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.308130887958	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.48232671553	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.269129066353	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.418712597352	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.483364637479	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.440292957858	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.641817636988	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.257385903589	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.490444282867	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.386821755701	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.460274395602	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.652557282081	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.394473122722	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.245497328782	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.269400966092	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.43590513354	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.469862431572	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.282474924612	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.340965114613	And...
0.0	0.37212548331	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.4503303096	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.531116226119	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.467799953645	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.657987070536	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.315535450833	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.426898437603	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.647771232999	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.347381385725	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.574218311508	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.436372139054	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.331155004259	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.393331150642	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.349892646121	This is 2016.
0.0	0.444659824028	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.376652008758	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.187183470584	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.606516179363	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.410272715636	in particular.
0.0	0.272189762556	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.198049906519	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.437905483988	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.247443900039	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.438250403344	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.249961037506	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.452377016933	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.336247326594	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.365099964966	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
1.0	0.680386658004	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.577684705414	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.227713746485	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.617320791843	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.416545556422	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.652767501028	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.447785090199	And I'm glad I did it.
1.0	0.445135447317	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.464349232822	You know why three?
0.0	0.323097878995	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.455298750186	That's not right.
0.0	0.474337768634	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.295287573523	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.505565018224	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.333731557422	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.49447279966	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.0976115519613	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.5	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.309367334671	I totally get that.
0.0	0.383310705938	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.358387307868	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.173973324072	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.688404509599	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.402920813254	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.470175592545	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.470120889217	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.392845995255	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.265944493269	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.5	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.387415209339	Everybody knows that.
1.0	0.787589858878	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.290994769737	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.473281154445	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.358487763292	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.535052323731	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.18688005749	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.660247963469	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.666107928536	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.487110677067	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.281057936168	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.5	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.246692928634	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.251005326343	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.374319155895	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.278908275487	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.380270467876	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.424281363441	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.350063091409	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.556768246997	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.397041685813	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.705697948318	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.39425907528	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.485753134235	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.455316476487	They're a scam.
0.0	0.459025281887	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.523886780697	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.531729087229	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.446148329224	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.164663009653	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.200184601192	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.433439381245	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.621013077021	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.392989383424	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.532291616575	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.199166835259	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.731210095181	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.28953256075	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.386567503439	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.56817588026	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.486824159829	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.56708755347	I was governor of New York on September 11.
1.0	0.490945141917	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.578615050769	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.535293110591	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.543466537588	Well, you know what?
1.0	0.178418051303	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.5	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.41032871292	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.437107809431	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.665472558523	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.530266640156	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.337418731093	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.260868423783	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.512490605528	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.419189766788	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.414753999923	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.515435427858	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.493097694759	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.399775989884	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.329194436734	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.485403402389	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.350629169902	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.428863189008	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.510854222919	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.512127583085	So you know what?
0.0	0.508264830699	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.4459773455	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
1.0	0.386199587899	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.237250592167	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.464153549248	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.352448795712	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.5	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.352781231935	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.560209089034	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.493917163937	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.322246381905	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.208298930656	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.35557099367	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.606639727607	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.329062499528	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.486812428688	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.518140361055	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.293889745046	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.472404457468	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.47015217045	You did.
0.0	0.51465395422	He has never defended...
0.0	0.402158661257	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.

0.0	0.404777998655	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.395992047356	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.637707755862	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.314196930581	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.475132690867	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
1.0	0.34268762269	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.561170294419	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.328271762523	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.267774908792	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.469410552286	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.422044503753	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.56298952094	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.452293096361	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.411327984709	No.
0.0	0.417607293445	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.46154509219	Good at email.
0.0	0.443766763791	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.5	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.579387689665	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.162108648557	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.327375945283	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.617378359463	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.52071989945	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.257163784759	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.344041748616	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.208887379145	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.463541443781	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.541478385373	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.362187135974	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.491102219932	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.464962275355	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.566587357762	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.523379875122	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.306086808504	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.640662052151	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.202965802817	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.764412513034	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
1.0	0.725110500298	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.350693991674	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.449062740296	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.0896801625583	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.417117480769	The answer is no.
0.0	0.365148342549	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.486975335878	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.534303061599	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.597579183602	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.360035477185	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.358127137133	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.350332623903	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.675387999841	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.382027383012	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.724087391576	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.332308751628	You find me...
0.0	0.396938600047	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.5	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.582212164991	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.454005371227	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.459617722095	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.364088399604	Neil...
0.0	0.401066458369	No, no.
0.0	0.377782776542	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.588982910429	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.395090882702	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.642636343886	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.493904979112	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.364088399604	Becky --
0.0	0.396085539303	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.520840285457	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.529068672501	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.559882942764	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.69629767477	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.537027179269	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.311826708628	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.30264574325	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.421714347692	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.155009371846	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.299764038672	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.443672564213	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
1.0	0.537130289147	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.423916963852	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.408443041706	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.543128237357	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.481069174135	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.34803492154	Divide that out.
0.0	0.567751561241	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.477747041811	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.617320791843	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.700976439478	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.371435452455	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
1.0	0.44733533856	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.311273972116	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.535190748757	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.201689069505	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.474896639791	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.564366396165	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.569325586952	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.138669231689	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.434203617788	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.367982656976	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.460861007971	You count on it.
0.0	0.343271936492	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.681113832734	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.380047221062	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.347394481375	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.593282455495	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.192212704606	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.41787131635	They're off to China.
0.0	0.332770124086	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.405335914646	You don't have to.
0.0	0.641708079938	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.534332646869	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.448157822577	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.305543150272	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
1.0	0.50630148803	They were wrong.
0.0	0.375996050877	Yeah.
0.0	0.554974757666	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.367129238391	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.238693113901	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.331182828765	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.513399618947	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.564315849477	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.489693356741	I was not at all.
0.0	0.400719793742	I will do that.
0.0	0.327502944112	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.5	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.375438464369	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.346770748175	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.449336557497	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.699396887845	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.5	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.555864442302	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.635841245478	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.466028279914	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.40162109522	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.515479040515	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.6285350366	I'm tested.
0.0	0.257004763214	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.194127622866	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.297182212192	I'd like to jump in.
1.0	0.595764407951	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.505051193531	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.427077561606	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.524753310295	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.332612179432	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.336738282338	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.286537052692	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.353558012834	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.385163748077	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.398670563754	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.652854493974	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.455486610477	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.361060619956	Check it out.
0.0	0.357284008683	I love this country.
0.0	0.173639874291	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.304605846164	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.45219281487	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.391761690312	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.449591966149	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.224284456013	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.589133430373	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.557308429353	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.254711291352	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.590550140221	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.519350314273	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.484750509719	He was on the board.
0.0	0.192648730623	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.467141753777	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.393699838184	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.207512529254	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.42592832831	You do.
0.0	0.400866264578	John?
1.0	0.676226176453	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.521719560052	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.671529728993	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.374299048489	Why?
0.0	0.52520780326	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.555108185032	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.334940450863	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.552742688501	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.405321132712	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.628718934449	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.340706630749	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.42411028191	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.29492330013	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.319779491709	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.138701830023	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.355471189755	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.484678614714	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.441976497221	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.39814040132	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.416139943423	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.525636044663	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.440526853234	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.205953836657	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.58272957406	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.688089970458	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.379495651633	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.384897719853	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.46427743667	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.400719793742	I'll say this.
0.0	0.181357520247	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.5	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.5	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.573867903256	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.410351283477	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.329499313513	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.269445201096	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.441457063673	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.315559760417	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.848271310655	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.279256854592	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.437424885756	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.55945634052	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.363274466535	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.35785957439	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.488762882215	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.606856569845	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.353392380862	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.403995435994	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.385683906442	Think about it.
0.0	0.400926033517	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.328592822376	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.463327161785	You target the bad guys.
1.0	0.644722525047	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.752020901991	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.430136380809	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.565162227609	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.371029434184	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.574469444711	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.4372045493	We need sound money.
0.0	0.475089559409	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.484987890944	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.253811466611	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.323214305509	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.546303927781	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.567603723474	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.450511833209	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.25024054876	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.551790935392	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.31321344229	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.5	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.343277427031	... on Larry Tribe.
1.0	0.609447245496	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.302683017773	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.475980555572	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.27156321272	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
1.0	0.786078288932	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.534619796505	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.527108058556	And you know what?
0.0	0.321103345898	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.778135122177	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.463274125236	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.273104744381	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.248813711467	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.413838572217	Absolutely.
0.0	0.212997106185	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.494040761074	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.424345267361	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.180490169605	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.33954131352	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.608536710404	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.595148658905	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.509524748512	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.887820369288	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.410686616324	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.525966744556	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.310845097966	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.587734136901	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.461786998453	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.363483033142	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.278209039212	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.549890339906	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.802301778818	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.466564278738	Both served.
0.0	0.35836087862	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.570905422731	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.382794359583	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.430862301703	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.414275165576	I promise.

0.0	0.327740889454	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.513227105088	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.239831021415	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.480990124249	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.251160485594	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.365684422204	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.476223099499	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.37133301624	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.297838078508	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.585113722435	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
1.0	0.629292393746	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
1.0	0.606740041267	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.348988087151	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.588249534593	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.551153319567	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.442808623164	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.327598685666	I love China.
0.0	0.515475203272	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.487244487277	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.693615308328	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.465390018481	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.409414364893	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.44909052404	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.385683906442	Think about it.
0.0	0.438457321114	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.390993397344	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.537672867079	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.554551244135	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.398589459146	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.230091775312	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.421801790742	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.412269684492	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.457236038662	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.558981556866	He hit oil.
0.0	0.259307200869	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.556534006815	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.420893391352	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.568927310624	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.423227712136	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.518105689236	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.226211525634	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.226612314827	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.5	That never works.
0.0	0.169286280076	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.44160641335	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.589991653482	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.313350332799	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.375996050877	OK.
0.0	0.531592145019	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.421422926576	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.719931172538	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.218505881903	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.548663661364	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.450016132652	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.374810177502	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.412961422482	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.393799717012	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.335334819955	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
1.0	0.342287424316	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.476323472645	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.725252825772	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.493042724728	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.316091857344	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.220671382556	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.375752008455	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.541524171959	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.586400475752	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.240537755562	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.454784026038	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.592694017279	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.43724464018	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.377988206266	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.476424560947	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.5	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.297685247354	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.545493294717	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.458195122117	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.388418122565	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.409007891097	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.412424493599	Bipartisan issue.
1.0	0.630435571741	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.5	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.4906597814	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.533109978916	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.802054771112	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.552742688501	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.487020396281	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.614490242005	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.297660983306	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.140795256635	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.50553879045	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.408701928666	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.505712384927	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.375262794963	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.204325353697	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.757290857409	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.333997906641	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.449891561292	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.449079498775	It never happens.
0.0	0.42747176658	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.545604745175	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.401352849516	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.5	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.461256917876	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.462132455435	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.136142401482	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.3113239127	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.480942461369	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.565286170633	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.567552020821	I never said that.
0.0	0.32081010584	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.247029756306	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.711958371247	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.339356265083	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.292269357061	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.317483126566	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.290542641106	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.

0.0	0.356859024803	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.29649762931	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.153122472902	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.517137837234	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.400062822607	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.633502904308	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.559071314437	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.440797470507	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.337844675267	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.428720289807	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.373529861806	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.430500607827	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.408494793902	We have to do something.
0.0	0.48826242863	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.452347649722	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.298553114348	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.355344742462	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.42932401708	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.489231393416	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.75250304912	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.489521294953	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.38031252359	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.391268863965	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.321956134958	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.450450260949	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.429157646286	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.375996050877	Okay.
0.0	0.537704708191	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.623219803898	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.66469335678	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.413838572217	Right.
0.0	0.347706707908	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.267855564273	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.455298750186	That is not right.
0.0	0.441142088703	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.370666562914	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.427992786284	slot.
0.0	0.680910331611	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.166169546237	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.368858258675	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.60005448149	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.430714463547	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.461670137013	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.5	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.457985139403	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.5	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.413152215168	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.402267208454	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.341027183637	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.355793965421	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.205772487173	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.413838572217	Right.
0.0	0.466747653579	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.374953761351	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.5	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.570346526997	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.400736029988	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.411971858455	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.511971836672	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.509507566318	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.449436920355	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.418596397928	Illegal.
0.0	0.465207759442	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.513725744144	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.382864254885	Say again?
0.0	0.447355026343	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.601741890265	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.461993024143	Well, I did.
0.0	0.525428257442	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.48002161503	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.493808822021	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.656970984001	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.318566472718	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.456567683161	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.441293988367	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.32801994123	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.338394564725	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.435849366082	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.111773116283	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.565187315447	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.603171123114	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.479990123183	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.492274755847	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.513180690522	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.494830819007	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.358019162749	I think he is right.
0.0	0.309390728026	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.421485418994	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.444994329097	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.481386743675	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.494061600177	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.222492709245	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.340944116334	You bet they do.
0.0	0.576080580519	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.100464224039	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.405156616279	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.352886147952	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.396294469358	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.384292123437	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.779680437982	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.315479129516	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
1.0	0.384344422147	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.255470366483	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.316714613523	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.261718911171	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.354823398426	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.444021225464	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.516440789642	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.414881323171	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.411327984709	No.
0.0	0.488954033852	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.564266390918	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.40908215282	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.386053876945	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.638577847788	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.558006976191	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.761628037417	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.228016291443	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.433821341804	But this is nothing new.
1.0	0.480748196071	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.6949290358	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.467548087591	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.3571753857	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.478931442458	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.546537227114	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.711859914072	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.427488483515	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.372138819839	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.623707133927	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.290698592892	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.5	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.220748565744	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.700652050919	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.298548954689	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.194983022941	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.53390896056	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.291654860752	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.255891597867	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.453664450831	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.356789223664	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.47120379545	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
1.0	0.60385280489	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.465022294678	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.66626242398	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.5	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.404290106496	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.409731901884	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.277449175405	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.202088587313	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.346620830518	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.515057456024	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.0966091306712	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.56439336569	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.264525348526	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.302271093229	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.386301751669	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.331256351973	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.390612060075	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.464508861914	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
1.0	0.461315296197	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.401346169048	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.367456426072	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.387646338643	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.367660440446	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.432781942406	That's what I said.
0.0	0.663041773996	She voted for it.
0.0	0.316975879114	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.471613581599	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.588560973433	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.380093273751	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.443737091495	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.380850791299	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.492776370676	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.464911381104	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.141346421843	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.603890574597	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.718004841355	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.32274549208	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.375121419639	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.82634308235	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.414179567444	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.292477497625	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.353829986718	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.450429759356	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.576563653629	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.385209773034	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.642178481574	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.476404490805	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.734580935454	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.157668263259	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.413640553119	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
1.0	0.672439882455	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.494229285914	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.257072529909	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.74688655802	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.526370631026	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.738143357173	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.565405901547	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.361706185916	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.209737392378	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.473584368397	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.738832916757	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.630684531964	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.84650832306	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.426001424956	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.482054254313	My background is different.
0.0	0.571258133904	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.264283819011	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.469756121855	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.541649985654	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.437828766679	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.358828579263	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.425965366918	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.424690367092	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.643748026491	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.435380655776	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.524955759173	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.437326298638	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.452079943275	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.67910525605	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.267815358933	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.507276066397	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.425676633096	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.199882282369	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.448127937508	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.5	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
1.0	0.675834145217	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.472385119869	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.353506231941	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.377385068707	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.40430602661	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.378919902543	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.428111192133	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.334703892973	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.354790698407	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.645150910758	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.187136308584	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
1.0	0.550603054608	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.42973306043	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.394631853463	And yes, it was a very difficult time.

0.0	0.406202878823	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.255054753235	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.420565380901	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.217759421525	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.460348291119	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.569039870723	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.388664809836	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.311655424759	...
0.0	0.471287902957	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.393134305547	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.577265921425	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.488707484971	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.400628342619	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.398972427669	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.287093430518	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.318169386924	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.494472577042	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.353211417492	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.322923024834	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.507792168747	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.315052963895	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
1.0	0.354503763878	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.296749977706	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.644974406166	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.423616428703	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.5	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.571620775346	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.318065818727	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.488367337935	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.587440913821	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.5	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.645125675342	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.205081007764	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.450690609979	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.311655424759	...
0.0	0.506597186981	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.305319178202	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.590886421209	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.34105728545	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.647561769841	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.0774539033751	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.246955220327	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.527225000085	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.446657874406	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.303593103626	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.433893909101	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.281202425492	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.480622895572	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.566992802042	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.61199559464	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.188120121992	And guess what?
0.0	0.5	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.478737866167	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.529571625844	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.5	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.43856151007	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.320950586108	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.411327984709	No.
0.0	0.400391026569	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.19627240993	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.542413090928	You're simply not.
0.0	0.336800588279	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.401980874367	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.375996050877	OK.
0.0	0.485841001113	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.290754213572	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.417802491612	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.445382223737	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.482301115111	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.277375533327	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.467731013233	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.32200828749	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.341568247062	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.366069738531	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.703810772084	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.444019427	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.368628754039	See?
0.0	0.397401509904	That's what he is.
0.0	0.650198387635	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.510035749188	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.269853744463	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.585875013813	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.5	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.384668141193	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.670989372796	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.55035330904	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.24525890398	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.459383384521	No, you did.
0.0	0.536736981702	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.53138189561	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.490529337798	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.519768202148	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.241587279769	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.375996050877	Yes.
0.0	0.32064560929	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.329080480887	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.40367813709	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.28281653008	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.652054471831	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.426814533623	Judy, one area very briefly...
1.0	0.617172293007	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.351884638269	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.390933043228	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.48670610623	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.419279893956	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.67329715172	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.552924332669	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.287252571644	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.532954562524	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.429207610555	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.398541657161	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.206307348517	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.480999922822	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.5	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.51508841514	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.476200966499	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.361220250173	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.489244262497	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.468593643743	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.259567125292	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.455298750186	That's not right.
0.0	0.553205239694	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.533094234079	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.293466418548	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.447449518139	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.614669393959	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.764315992359	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.29077115592	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.406873352308	How great is that?
0.0	0.679774911057	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.355913445861	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.365436264148	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.255073130432	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.254934704587	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.5976494931	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.229857045768	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.39425907528	Thank you.
0.0	0.48245737707	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.479170047508	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.313155831515	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.413838572217	Dynamically.
0.0	0.473047204591	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.489105373462	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.568244898736	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.438819843864	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.390784145577	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
1.0	0.315267801259	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.536333677797	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.5	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.366629583429	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.217044530169	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.317526651337	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.485984438496	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.697094027584	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.457419915327	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.45382209209	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.47496993889	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.319839492559	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.717384361257	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.571171735542	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
