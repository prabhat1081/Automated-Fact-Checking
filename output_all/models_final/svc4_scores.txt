0.0	0.236667148577	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.382786439649	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.251830629922	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.370589689659	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.517452323336	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.491898149341	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.360383229266	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.260006024216	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.508159332179	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.317527940554	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.295134833648	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.301509832886	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.430864939052	That's right.
0.0	0.580277575251	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.411597202349	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.267870725703	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.48819328902	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.51066753764	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.439468248644	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.431749658899	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.370675887853	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.518050615735	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.233544911143	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.430038020476	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
1.0	0.623322778543	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.204186580455	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.577113290807	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.548768097883	They're a scam.
0.0	0.388913949686	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.616799434894	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.582230140907	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.396305186643	You know that.
0.0	0.220847584097	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.429786782062	Good at email.
0.0	0.306138873315	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.756954902975	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.477129220212	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.550798538855	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.436724114466	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.467708906275	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.297000476177	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.306547327711	Here's the thing.
1.0	0.442847270794	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.867198170366	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
1.0	0.214538574836	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.26611739585	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.442041019207	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.446325709897	I never said that.
0.0	0.446458500969	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.564855192159	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.429072130936	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.391961603008	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.505736367918	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.301730356363	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.542402008851	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.202900491898	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.329011966314	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.41653275309	No, you did.
0.0	0.315758105905	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.290318325273	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.374906127129	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.265208850982	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.513303817895	I said no.
0.0	0.460573087858	You target the bad guys.
1.0	0.611879667506	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.252154399813	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.332792857694	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.434393924878	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.626164040722	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.850265405907	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.526320781884	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.401161947135	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.416283051089	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.477482560549	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.819539399784	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.171882814878	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.557186657136	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.448124987781	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.481260384456	I'm tested.
0.0	0.273948329378	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.465329958399	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.38926029732	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.464387070748	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.246111648658	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.148181630606	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.313847748476	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.427396090422	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.473914135333	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.507067902914	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.416378726064	I love this country.
0.0	0.381542786052	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.531263091793	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.338327796795	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.47129811585	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.288982677056	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.864414947928	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.695221738877	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.341465260255	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.402383301594	Right.
0.0	0.373006035319	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.342126727492	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.674587832314	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.399610332872	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.412799143911	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.559210992427	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.364457884082	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.340246567875	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.299135052006	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.111253895499	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.331435283908	Wait for what?
0.0	0.464555020921	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.256023885324	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.563562625253	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.450070546106	It was.
0.0	0.357885545595	You know why?
0.0	0.798210264938	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.319032742244	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.456302577017	We are lowering taxes on small business.
1.0	0.987867288853	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.523913011573	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.462227422588	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.385951231685	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.506744994934	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.369445496608	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.427579618152	That is not right.
0.0	0.523792415955	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.221834054748	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.280298582034	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.440567835927	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.5126846416	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.631326669427	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.612233011699	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.329051304286	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.276154461769	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.224059845687	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.432400971845	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.544557067175	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.465581741867	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.329715714141	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.322719717038	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.339404867853	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.644834330296	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.360601952315	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.635070448298	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.28009239963	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.345320977006	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.387486982924	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.490937162932	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.350714388472	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.539061152523	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.466607775796	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.5	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.452449796566	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.674792028884	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
1.0	0.611498660422	It looked like very few women.
1.0	0.840625444201	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.53101234742	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.378492426654	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.467378551914	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.4479971058	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.397332027284	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.303820046827	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.469725557159	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.35446051172	We need sound money.
0.0	0.340151779399	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.482352492373	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.703413105528	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.345482394167	So you might not.
0.0	0.393401001012	She said the truth.
0.0	0.633983075389	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.617078154522	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.562488981078	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.439202834337	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.357527930689	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.437958633059	You get together.
0.0	0.245984178016	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
1.0	0.454445015982	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.441213123895	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.245954947138	The number of women --
0.0	0.443022114692	You know, that's so simple.
1.0	0.525338451542	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.654939663462	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.47537014671	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.419580985507	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.424248473134	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.190021115003	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.5	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.369387798336	I promise.
0.0	0.70696725718	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.346232715269	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
1.0	0.685303895088	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.316720550011	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.455363764535	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.355803659288	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.375242632761	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.648823625709	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.549454485177	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.436589288225	It goes away.
0.0	0.739327708057	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.75280613758	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.371886585024	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.

0.0	0.231776189636	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.435823221877	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.

0.0	0.489777833553	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.355507586493	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.

0.0	0.449378905665	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.298906170045	But, I would also add this.

0.0	0.353609452013	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.524589052967	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.335039279464	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.

0.0	0.413793844957	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.445762313132	My background is different.

0.0	0.378913477366	That's good.

0.0	0.367346508342	My point is this.
0.0	0.561442032842	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.446859383132	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.

0.0	0.450642869032	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.364759150617	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.253620969346	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.362780598084	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.267185462758	But...
0.0	0.463640324214	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.258240150678	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.

0.0	0.177217266584	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.354804803113	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.430379640015	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.334636314549	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.229155607995	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.

0.0	0.645450846561	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.514643399297	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.206900705836	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.440285753834	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.244996085081	We need to have stronger families.

0.0	0.356611604488	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.32082811312	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.557791607107	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.529969140134	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.41255330812	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.511904319647	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.706131165878	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.596520311582	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.265610416937	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.595175314556	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.609171248725	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.446325709897	I never said that.

0.0	0.661821246461	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.424957886256	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.548844820818	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.437901334535	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.515139192898	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.442822230578	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.5	You've got to give people hope.

0.0	0.393685618811	We have a lot of work to do.

0.0	0.271141731971	It's true.
0.0	0.489745244144	We both have a lot of small donors.

0.0	0.412241491121	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.565619301058	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.370679849756	Illegal.
0.0	0.244272134212	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.367901343469	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.339883818145	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.370624125133	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.321578237712	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.37437041567	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.295012267473	What should we do?
0.0	0.374686914151	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.168076593434	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.357096481097	...Thank you.
0.0	0.231595346269	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.598860228167	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.475845552058	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.167180875945	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.29267137239	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.525256582738	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.402269702549	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.458249724672	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.129130911581	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.351122663717	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.633933813899	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.21829253855	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.604943422876	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.260899174007	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.466790975483	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.553677791711	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.449814650739	I know every one.
0.0	0.420142842757	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.305816084733	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.222619036324	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.348546312075	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.

0.0	0.592878145144	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.47890826001	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.633270216865	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.611818468562	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.386841716554	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.298634472997	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.282274501382	This country is changing.
0.0	0.593457019419	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.478102862441	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
1.0	0.472111620865	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.33941445506	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.393716518108	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.440838014419	That is important.
0.0	0.181372249464	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.2443980615	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.751703886177	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.224405345635	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.39083837137	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.

0.0	0.938683536225	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.

0.0	0.598645584831	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.44426460617	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.

0.0	0.607760277126	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.546248278004	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.

0.0	0.5	He was on the board.

0.0	0.441336095819	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.281513339685	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.205138866504	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.350841727699	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.450070546106	You did.
0.0	0.2194092917	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.534044860238	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.40948971629	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.364759150617	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.815005534281	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.384196947717	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.261758225561	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.377568822105	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.473715518008	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.561311439711	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.288839581589	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.727050444446	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.425151037429	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.361553758035	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.405106490023	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.0759651713448	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.43497003945	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.414633902748	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.382496670947	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.340449858391	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.403427343396	Creativity.
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.243806350281	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.291035150869	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
1.0	0.866386095744	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.670985951292	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.252461679099	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.646472002691	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.411414907686	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.173161215013	...No, sir...
0.0	0.227126728329	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.160477614232	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.38748725243	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.330321018103	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.2957023723	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.41680636619	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.629189520722	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.172210197151	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.376726603339	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.434248359812	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.295662798806	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.271357166314	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.710193230999	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.828204027029	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.296357531134	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.701605822938	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.351787950738	No, no.
0.0	0.385371631864	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.487875946049	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.480016753231	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.384275566872	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.419140737712	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.404547877402	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.527271748425	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.559353139675	And you know what?
0.0	0.734996390345	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.47454085203	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.62542547092	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.28958891832	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.41757938334	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.431203585705	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.287532796933	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.356477699902	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.31833002892	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.449416008955	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.573432861571	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.327376585459	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.515120808404	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.5	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.0607916702452	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.456613151224	slot.
0.0	0.515548567748	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.281562234684	...
0.0	0.477994139449	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.177616068014	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.302954121692	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.280229940892	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.245574690976	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.47208409239	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.585594318962	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.470644139858	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.269967322661	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.366129608331	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.385014942218	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.227445207358	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.479794280536	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.460985998567	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.317529170961	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.568465235315	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.362295571192	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.31330393496	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.398470257821	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.5	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.42006923924	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.402345080627	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.170289720763	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.541407831197	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.402383301594	Right.
0.0	0.276964244993	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.460461431731	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.212514293757	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.248377191692	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.155582013276	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
1.0	0.271942938191	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.584996485653	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.448823311574	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.299759494938	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.468932803293	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.337813974089	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.779281909437	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.318538475194	John, I'd like to address this?
1.0	0.167144992021	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.477429419595	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.692769694694	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.612888136041	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.400095002457	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.174643235989	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.20795917203	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.300596599619	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.646750140094	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.332038279971	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
1.0	0.0813534243097	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.280300955173	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.363353070934	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.573850965665	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.625354647238	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.

0.0	0.485774188692	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.241098131298	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.471939953139	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.359133522623	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.

0.0	0.395414485671	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.212078652319	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.

0.0	0.528094116321	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.278295520558	But look...
1.0	0.248439470576	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.559545602225	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.339831339024	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.208152254431	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.48057064563	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.403475260851	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.125460121523	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.486244481525	(inaudible).
0.0	0.622977923717	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.557620607754	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.30782931824	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.676226479534	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.635697706212	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.218144555692	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.261475187245	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.0701622182519	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.135457003027	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.538639700674	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.453929851888	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.32182438198	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.682245176532	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.432618311813	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.211575970682	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.539480715123	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.358240107439	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.459517558561	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.555566594017	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.327658334497	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.233305713414	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.267185462758	And...
0.0	0.543658504513	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.577066596838	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.488225804065	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.301532428799	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.526593201392	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.305202392741	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.321409307226	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.579399367871	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.161599834879	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.343509842799	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.956758929966	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.291708368748	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.296246434857	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.465431865174	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.48705954937	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.337804624756	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.420696814208	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.231032479326	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.616767263913	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.628288589436	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.230911060593	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.272654502892	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.548093556778	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.406589042324	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.471140746939	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.644517013091	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.335991089626	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.354093328527	That is...
0.0	0.306558619483	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.243637674198	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.328167561044	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.431672053686	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.33279556735	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.472658313482	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.677975738185	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.426294207772	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.346364095045	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.303132671247	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.247933197796	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.261397017181	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.450242938235	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.55307192715	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.357999431549	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.244853660694	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.358976877485	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.22975586771	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.435507876967	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.344007548794	Big difference.
0.0	0.247394592217	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.15333890953	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.538014275858	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
1.0	0.436829983184	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.32942968364	OK?
0.0	0.450279757259	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.280657746045	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.577595513269	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.23021201206	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.260917564423	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.396855508081	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.311727068255	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.4776499505	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.730224500714	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.349884990797	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.252451446196	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.12561924133	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.511214006882	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.259113571583	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.376759595607	...before I go.
0.0	0.293188935012	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.541632988266	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.315583447304	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.538423405404	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.418802494052	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.367822068084	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.473761433278	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.36883444579	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.543891417519	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.300088272804	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.593989678747	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.722316403932	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.21638404421	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.157718226844	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.28680536439	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.295618601479	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.5	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.510917273905	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.354916524263	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.393469385029	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.684496585189	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.259377560803	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.290004880734	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.307005685049	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.445951186254	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.398384792116	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.662509154532	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.379897692455	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.760893318519	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.465722496063	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.432332278505	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.636348450415	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.578798250602	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.372268172019	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.246336671721	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.406144556524	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.382068800036	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.415777875867	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.483596804974	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.430668124482	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.533924758746	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.244133951659	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.515658326256	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.271017918227	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.2519696742	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.278065583394	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.345727017616	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.51122630118	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.520730248019	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.373214223659	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.317160081067	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.422481011944	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.402320889556	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.747124510025	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.766591024319	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.257645818228	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.402383301594	Right.
0.0	0.541403591666	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.5	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.297991257529	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.76076872615	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.513961482363	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.397559907657	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.44680267663	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.560844291253	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
1.0	0.53376746006	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.381392929873	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
1.0	0.732600431199	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.60441067619	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.35807658065	How about this?
0.0	0.457218838538	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.592752672367	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.572825971817	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.424291784996	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.452135624031	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.449736291722	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.344675683692	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.407523448969	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.290799824986	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.200190846763	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.321712683054	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.423146994399	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.443139766056	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.340915539046	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.261692755154	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.300634185189	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.413865678504	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
1.0	0.300337064249	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.421370537964	You know why three?
0.0	0.280919739565	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.44420343478	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.505325566031	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.267957039171	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.355766066019	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.545848465402	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.254794853663	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.476434296408	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.250990631378	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.550810399333	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.419450333442	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.232202871614	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.317419578164	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.2789669147	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.347206602582	You can have him.
0.0	0.594148360296	She voted for it.
0.0	0.440739984001	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.5	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.211289692021	In all due respect...
0.0	0.300226523861	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.569481368601	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.401812880321	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.130653557603	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.29540869413	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.687627114843	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.91513667318	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.460284716591	I win.
0.0	0.416099118569	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.552880484858	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.473926969174	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.236282069536	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.447968816179	You really can't.
0.0	0.336428012689	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.480882790665	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.183694237497	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
1.0	0.874160523733	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.284640650592	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.480967504727	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.508337553282	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.493618062315	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.434413777046	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.33109317399	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.350654005896	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.461522962541	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.478587789626	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.464214847221	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.928598107305	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.357396504663	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.41059326463	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.451331888519	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.396709503468	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.427579618152	That's not right.
0.0	0.258362318747	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.313828658376	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.559353139675	And you know what?
0.0	0.585946676835	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.406930907091	We do.
0.0	0.339549953576	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.380392061473	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.460040263867	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.306547327711	Here's the thing.
1.0	0.733624164788	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.535315688129	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.606642582797	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.370952200098	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.5	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.45108419443	I've done it.
0.0	0.457623078165	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.341822332275	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.299441479465	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.648341585838	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.489182173846	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.386719264678	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.589033437956	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.463978921539	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.491527300855	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.321886086645	But I would add this.
0.0	0.648983946912	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.229090284369	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.684783854549	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.24479526511	No, it's true.
0.0	0.482639427479	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.471687940834	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.435425114405	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.338201978456	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.173150941248	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.467330007732	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.606562285371	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.494793678122	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.48384073471	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.353910142293	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.258192297925	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.50879666354	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.431929560687	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.194496478526	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.358169745388	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.192770749456	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.731073289899	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.48069710999	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.474679935978	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.570143068919	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.359287585648	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.476374220114	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.376526828581	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.428923268517	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.316918555556	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.57836181596	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.230399745641	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.395266875033	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.340374139557	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.483923149894	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.5	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.517872443679	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.383479515323	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.377583627804	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.101796951024	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.511222950768	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.406224589495	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.185676853453	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.717129998013	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.4491889453	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.391032939824	I'm looking out for the American worker.
1.0	0.645867795645	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.417566843017	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.458987360221	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.460802984409	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.5	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.375517073944	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.3959053618	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.367935028609	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.433147314075	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.235013495397	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.392776895484	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.387901322252	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.180322032665	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.296152445909	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
1.0	0.705434054675	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.293834467452	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.134483278889	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.339781401822	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.5	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.460527012545	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.184868164864	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.29556401668	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.627755758998	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.21837502899	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.648215533745	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.298480267612	It's a joke.
0.0	0.310504346483	I would change them.
0.0	0.458771693842	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.306633448521	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.400275297089	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.457415508054	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.461475462448	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.547421231606	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
1.0	0.559947208538	I didn't have an involvement with them.
1.0	0.593693480931	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.566349873064	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.158621477648	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.309591728566	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.35936786526	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.572371102904	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.721942549889	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.397461307165	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.654294100107	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.494006497137	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.337397783514	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.451373496182	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.344336787707	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.308355586641	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.485680384544	That's fine.
0.0	0.297672799717	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.200767275446	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.193236024195	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.34107210469	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.401885135828	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.553923983554	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.253994172314	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
1.0	0.772808974637	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.446136701171	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.18992082869	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.478090852707	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.32942968364	Yes.
0.0	0.217336190257	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.245401872978	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.211044238981	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.336175994945	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.556990681678	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.482092957608	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.354255011746	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.0350317332834	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.398269929724	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.418153015761	Not bad.
0.0	0.421271181802	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.483835382689	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.404799124022	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.314658259333	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.215699667888	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.177518317172	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.151265656346	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.401236587112	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.402383301594	Right.
0.0	0.682351168256	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.419992401897	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.451886747412	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.534407391879	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.378315133903	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.354392350755	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.215000476863	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.450649941632	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.37520312663	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.348189171493	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.430515807473	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.253086758751	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.41143347284	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.515968779312	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.672200058746	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.142460107935	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.397509050427	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.120280157847	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.479905037846	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.374949039617	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.206588648421	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.563120756166	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.220574100062	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.380702701892	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.74356086186	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.593848762709	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.371100618358	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.565603843302	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.470474685047	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.343096469975	I like that.
0.0	0.228331242109	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.250757782678	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.300247496238	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.377971631425	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.397492617761	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.363918038868	Think about it.
0.0	0.488032210389	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.402383301594	Dynamically.
0.0	0.348602429032	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.579115066868	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.153602241768	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.14115944813	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.507969865415	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.536274710482	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.5	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.521631085479	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.435034690687	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.507079763594	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.418842263593	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.517244329083	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.377868828218	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.30157520632	He undermines it.
0.0	0.258331388983	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.419489637549	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.724129276555	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.412619147438	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.136942118256	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.285109147528	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.239422237075	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.399019465995	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.280320433211	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.797933008183	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.379390718169	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.507348477416	Both served.
0.0	0.281751665282	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.552638286251	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.530241090171	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.560791886834	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.444032193472	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.439991007551	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.332056450677	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.316642838539	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.315633706694	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.51808326396	You have to lead.
0.0	0.596635468763	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.453288065584	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.493951093043	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.421184950976	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.211527210522	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.286997200433	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.259187813987	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.673000959898	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.29420517727	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.309414494271	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.361004269068	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.755900476371	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.336876834876	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.309768680539	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.542835861847	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.367130016914	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.411813689914	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.284121103678	We're running.
0.0	0.887644778927	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.217700108745	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.401866650817	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.192739976857	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.538175322952	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.406930907091	I have.
0.0	0.466847361666	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.428178397981	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.896039263166	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.312305702715	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.223754323173	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.222407863344	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.402904591391	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.299361854228	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.348837967538	Again...
0.0	0.320006205031	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.316614450581	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.471576007737	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.482421680449	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.397978188801	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.290242842652	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.378290011914	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.563200418621	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.0559551979399	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.610995449555	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.433487426675	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.751020102097	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
1.0	0.937537089861	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.745237772209	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.19468644534	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.306964067835	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.314449833815	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.299374428626	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.358121163077	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.380949232104	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.563139984152	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.455300979372	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.281562234684	...
0.0	0.167703754807	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.24696351806	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.522511501703	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.673793153594	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.5	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.426218333728	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.391127909932	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.467497224026	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.367641794983	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.425269981883	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.244346551021	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.340157366353	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.225542272907	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.418586595625	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.439471168548	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.233349693536	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.361692159384	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.428563616679	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.182071393208	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.349744143412	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.171121847017	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.298336275422	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.824561661681	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.444388209085	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.411172694053	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.317391757371	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.461415377392	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.4552259	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.424024439979	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.402861300959	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.298077499552	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.335889465169	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.549186641741	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.5	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.362473968234	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.242523441558	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.32942968364	OK.
0.0	0.23232163051	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.250738318641	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.534354303556	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.108023516121	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.563591721322	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.732886689343	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.562801667289	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.292408525011	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.66838516695	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.557440859151	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.386954961312	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.387220569958	They don't like that.
0.0	0.672782046262	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.370455399397	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.906478498734	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.418902279458	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.310538680736	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.215775324182	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.282043347186	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.240520274174	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.401008051109	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.544035107688	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.410250155462	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.337731255919	Divide that out.
0.0	0.199491845877	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.52891716616	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.415917775297	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.570806051933	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.174805696122	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.473530595474	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.34141522337	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.522123115621	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.471262106452	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.337080763457	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.12679981119	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.467940047206	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.552725216431	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.344811991306	I will not do that.
0.0	0.40126202541	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.248771326948	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.479602599031	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.454928297024	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.457551231662	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.482699590579	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.553146999347	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.559402915093	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.332662296881	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.290068018832	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.606079257448	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.487907466734	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.443914428541	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.383928525647	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.643868479434	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.471686279413	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.460881893141	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.444401840508	What have you got now?
0.0	0.455903118156	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.462286602471	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.485896735393	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.336331087656	That will change everything.
0.0	0.382451700479	No.
0.0	0.291172693302	You bet they do.
0.0	0.160477614232	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.265052560752	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.282912363545	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.375707682008	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.432601285872	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.45732811573	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.474589308041	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.292978571554	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.607339041189	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.359812090661	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.32942968364	Yeah.
0.0	0.303924877423	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.398712194042	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.594060915199	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.335403307262	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.619002573951	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.344749544913	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.851473479416	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.489171229787	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.546203743561	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.645418017178	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.23343610903	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.473647457625	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.264602862012	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.453999638459	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.639046997025	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.351923737077	Our next president...
0.0	0.423937926154	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.231757014088	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.393887001634	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.441139684067	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.625527946273	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.40944532768	White people?
0.0	0.315995576683	OK, good.
0.0	0.394936512388	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.482582540706	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.461290131571	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.472368607332	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.463249934157	We actually did it.
0.0	0.297739686177	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.639032833688	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.544972646226	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.42925627191	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.351777358454	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.233180597242	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.389524337986	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.375285186008	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.436003264859	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.260598889307	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.47109400277	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.646672485966	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.480786133289	We had Hamas.
1.0	0.473025502728	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.454713787141	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.103792667781	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.433559607376	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.255941803031	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.634943743733	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.242932133185	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.27576484969	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.220393427949	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.356411796193	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.681103664261	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.31524812791	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.357338829761	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.398925236278	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.359937370318	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.682443457151	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.540934350964	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.523348928218	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
1.0	0.609629554715	Very few children.
0.0	0.405194051211	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.178300765759	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.406596798013	They're off to China.
0.0	0.633371400449	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.846515355743	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.492507994777	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.53469627034	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.400818839268	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.41978002625	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.389264287749	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.173332279663	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.389174481675	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.34564442777	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.427579618152	That's not right.
0.0	0.236267242326	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.320972499405	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.306230874534	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.32942968364	Yes.
0.0	0.67151481539	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.205003621906	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.689307885407	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.385685095779	I think he is right.
0.0	0.643040243157	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.303665150999	I think you're --
0.0	0.240597401019	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.404920432296	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.570716118856	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.708872767517	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.174658155481	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.471935198129	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.921962926	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.699034302288	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.259072140702	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.406656399729	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.272528186877	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.459482421069	I understand.
0.0	0.4390381142	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.237482515337	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.296456510763	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.198051139346	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.305581752129	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.328270453765	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.406960703251	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.5878140722	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.394100096141	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.414587169408	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.417844107179	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.213435027514	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.400724891344	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.658894869885	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.431752290516	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.591231054088	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.381827648649	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.488847776468	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.571402244494	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.554974343706	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.691733731747	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.273801532785	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.447892440704	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.433871251295	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.0958117032916	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.248361025592	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.37438364877	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.603351903137	So you know what?
0.0	0.264358787327	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.195166823096	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.37930799269	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
1.0	0.466705281507	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.37929472155	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.273429272626	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.542338447436	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.81606433666	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.304415172225	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.295129393536	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.330704495268	These...
0.0	0.342118403378	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.246114204671	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.333335761503	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.129485746618	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.61649945477	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.710415225984	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.535870566152	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.462388069564	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.309156247213	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.260962933299	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.515978908106	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.238739619473	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.593239797291	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.485656746933	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.158467068491	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.307427827345	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.624184874599	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.5	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.47156817592	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.457475376232	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
1.0	0.533887369647	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.301133050732	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.362853722608	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
1.0	0.303062223447	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.381748808812	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.353632578834	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.294679231578	I don't care.
0.0	0.676927756034	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.66544557194	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.09576589109	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.244455816897	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.538075797885	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.372459938913	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.392904166957	Say again?
0.0	0.207612424055	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.358697567317	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.321775544602	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.370531801463	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.533952871033	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.679978047454	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.210805818662	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.356188042077	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.571358928088	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.483385814519	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.349536387689	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.260570967807	I would just say that...
0.0	0.42721960181	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
1.0	0.426354075775	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.563644169908	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.577332165471	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.627442752788	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.453328092666	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
1.0	0.37111515096	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.377071033989	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.755076477127	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.45016758166	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.453030970763	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.443116620891	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.798342260751	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.193215810247	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.574524806343	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.383857101131	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.472321142466	I will show you what they do to women.
1.0	0.58067143815	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.564632099328	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.572696633925	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.631895758368	Of course not.
0.0	0.162535806585	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.5	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.198775823259	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.313793497186	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.883685400042	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.470491168743	I changed that.
0.0	0.545816309298	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.330807929497	The answer is no.
0.0	0.650657469975	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.440770035194	I can't do it.
0.0	0.505083346066	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.266500897717	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.721343422777	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.805741724646	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.38452251367	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.393843153555	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.517677138584	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.249350984673	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
1.0	0.590496794897	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.603139181298	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.515749451044	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.647264566348	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.372980174941	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.404136040212	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.484599575923	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.671996357205	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.373874148416	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.701561630123	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.402060212673	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.5	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.214826560765	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.468009748077	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.215996243331	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.134312501847	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.220057854903	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.208918234027	-- the governor's absolutely right.
1.0	0.478808858391	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.238325539493	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.41664338828	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.467760234119	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.284934748411	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.41745413853	It's their money.
0.0	0.467083493601	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.289453200957	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.409062294715	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.661759091526	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.422617644767	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.446536752308	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.470404525025	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.215995483525	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.484521314045	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.443031111818	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
1.0	0.411845491057	That's wrong.
0.0	0.388309733983	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.370864740367	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.226694672846	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.433649567934	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.402650608576	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.0860927124902	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.379940796059	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.48084659828	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
1.0	0.470958595987	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
1.0	0.455623641425	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.281562234684	...
0.0	0.442538661846	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.651770650525	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.235336289232	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.834912070461	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.387892951834	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.787311328375	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.147206216885	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.32942968364	OK.
0.0	0.366722704013	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.560946126264	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.523346983003	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.423904943675	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.244689332667	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.694751846447	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.300263960056	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.20778485966	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.279581826852	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.239656519089	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.395036674158	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.465165283766	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.341412152395	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.130725104507	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.361599902155	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.525715574208	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.243507514393	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.34675322287	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.409346773874	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.349041919243	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.424770504631	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.389791329425	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.575750351715	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.5	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.5	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.5	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.458691247964	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.374690498731	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.614771487767	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.446579419605	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.311620497244	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.523095032757	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.48995213836	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.642373846578	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.362523718011	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.33605484249	Well, sure.
0.0	0.545302372863	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.434384982704	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.445734669606	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.358486038791	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.523017395886	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.264579420468	I totally get that.
0.0	0.316140134716	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.386593319306	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.463503776876	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.338852334674	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.360014562388	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.389524337986	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.477182527308	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.406330527718	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.59332473374	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.479173316694	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.72956729445	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.272593434025	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.404086346794	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.789439913322	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.45425129247	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.35197082157	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.493115605505	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.128566542138	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.405190412683	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.536708416075	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.514109786265	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.27432409657	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.323336395202	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.539625555178	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.582534483591	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.355980546588	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.915305663746	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.370108977475	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.489723698359	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.5	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.362472297715	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.245686742508	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.381734419332	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.625770964114	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.2224869764	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.322058290931	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.561554255488	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.255952181461	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.5	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.258664779709	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.216464593562	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.626861079884	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
1.0	0.371395309753	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.545087927243	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.664039192388	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.751864062443	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.221869526942	You find me...
0.0	0.401194855528	John?
0.0	0.634599684677	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.532793276246	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.399968927141	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.

0.0	0.0568709828239	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.559353139675	And you know what?
0.0	0.438843349715	We have to put more money.

0.0	0.13238148458	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.375857410863	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.

0.0	0.659344729219	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.617858828291	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.241098131298	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.646044428044	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.

0.0	0.415960729009	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.332565099189	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.191914530972	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.27050923806	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.259948305723	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.477380236531	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.630183284944	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.546164071607	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.32942968364	Okay.

0.0	0.692938161658	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.463933946629	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.352438774494	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.353511963837	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.

0.0	0.235215470482	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.333595703335	I've laid out...
1.0	0.508991373964	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.481759135464	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.

0.0	0.453463299409	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.547337402739	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.333920585561	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.629656569281	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.33058594353	How do I know this?
0.0	0.371592722937	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.284302113369	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.22042326457	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.556256362215	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.755660125971	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.645430485686	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.437323549004	Well, I did.
0.0	0.410730186917	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.275553452271	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.528767526947	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.486623397936	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.468905572525	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.575537056075	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.210587423617	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.259927177606	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.398210839326	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.592348539834	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.317756362493	Why?
0.0	0.474931085221	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.551362317146	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.398198581973	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.463654309283	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.433528961973	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.522071511421	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.564640553256	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.305407364524	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.705871792191	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.272011306167	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.309121241068	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.289215492243	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.51702090351	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.404580963227	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.572481060328	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.283670976066	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.237057366806	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.413654462082	That's what he is.
0.0	0.647306870642	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.423112028319	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.276371677202	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.413028538737	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.478079573154	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.596619373837	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.372219544389	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.382451700479	No.
0.0	0.395656134606	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.465783669313	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.432111409403	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.281835277438	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.388999964008	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.5	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.322833250703	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.340145193629	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.395994234435	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.551080322855	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.322907938759	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.477222474921	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.418058935694	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.5	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.1210957196	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.459899386413	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.402540787711	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.425137822194	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.172472145588	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.720247342421	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.306931761919	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.474847860374	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.259350976438	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.5	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.457499204768	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.561766075444	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.544941242346	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.403030489375	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.482102366953	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.307133114861	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.347415737857	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.768564485171	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?

0.0	0.35660052223	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.395553209805	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.

0.0	0.570537443147	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.215518232339	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.345168568075	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
1.0	0.493637939149	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.209646878638	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.390354093884	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.

0.0	0.385955732145	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.33335926881	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.587253342021	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?

0.0	0.390205699358	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.490457204769	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.662411026383	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.624690533548	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.166776523903	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.626926559715	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.342319321766	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.298718621603	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.361171589063	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.640081497068	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.436589288225	It never happens.
0.0	0.348079626769	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.561550664567	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.52778596155	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.837995961596	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.590882792088	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.234300818215	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.846681167497	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.32310632427	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.572916291252	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.387974828203	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
1.0	0.486151450074	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.485680384544	That's fine.
0.0	0.270604451186	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.532627762895	He hit oil.
0.0	0.529882571468	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.599189446277	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.335415506909	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.83856982235	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.484371299877	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.446325709897	I never said that.
0.0	0.249975580956	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.542867723524	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.437958633059	We haven't.
0.0	0.553419536566	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.422717914018	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.238195240224	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.344458251626	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.216469325264	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.723428017863	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.349751510676	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.610979205618	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.678824929862	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.557569348738	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.356636388695	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.652551492605	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.372196848565	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.632272422632	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.382032743962	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.235823796289	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.660604601272	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.370431767933	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.449273811275	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.461440676687	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.0978700926668	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.441024999056	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.672456145585	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.370281422852	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.471633462601	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.592999642765	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.5	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.332549259384	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.435007125592	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.321435637681	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.206500875547	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.58101725746	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.63533976229	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.316469361929	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.347582972155	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.425897301018	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.437065072421	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.351752279671	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.682245176532	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.291303581837	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.543256325515	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.479602599031	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.568500441569	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.335447429334	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.518977162974	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.408291715977	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.537938259276	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.539500703351	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.483524179544	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.469542047983	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.275801269729	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.23216442843	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.423776022327	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.193300857748	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.393901131253	About Medicare?
0.0	0.525353845985	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.564263973877	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.22619075934	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.811317384434	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.0305141074099	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.377741719761	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.484753409993	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.242633182296	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.274272644695	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.658510244945	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.122297285583	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.538341256402	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.404777179219	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.138449989172	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.490507591504	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.434189923787	A brief response.
0.0	0.318462764718	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.109743922468	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.388509772533	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.272551271835	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.290432155113	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.615241415422	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.338615749235	Let me tell you how that question...

0.0	0.408628691128	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.

0.0	0.344083593272	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.674245919138	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.29411237546	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.57464797942	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...

0.0	0.526109359315	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.374516576796	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.239166769602	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.64531555438	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.753452301663	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.53668303968	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.275978984208	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.581253597003	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.614362509747	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
1.0	0.675999219441	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.482265091159	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.

0.0	0.443178295597	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.877982964953	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.266475814731	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.296392302214	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.23279528673	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.

0.0	0.588660688428	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.

0.0	0.382451700479	No.
0.0	0.4453837247	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.44405830616	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.265177285937	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.186240635985	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.332034940155	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.461239428182	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.435546641751	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.393052161123	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.455829524439	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.374298028298	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.620757350603	You had two one hundred...
1.0	0.87150071769	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.

0.0	0.535772777139	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.577734046261	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.454382167069	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.810480187899	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.418686934853	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.267604858597	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.204312661883	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.532200787098	The world has changed.
0.0	0.67061786025	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.39262367328	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.583983779724	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.486995278861	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.531298039322	Two points.
0.0	0.348324879963	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.19642809339	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.534395895845	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.192636566886	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.392982377684	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.665576187834	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.448887628428	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.

0.0	0.550828355397	Just for the record.
0.0	0.453686606224	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.272086188123	So what if mass unemployment exists?

0.0	0.2761181346	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.281562234684	...
0.0	0.34840420524	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.261094382282	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.721528832585	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.574014543389	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.294585519035	I want to reverse that decline.

0.0	0.516027211848	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.527594807805	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.323004401757	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.321302769187	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.668199876239	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.315075115281	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.627721309795	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.579034217384	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.376169883128	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.429138557927	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.193595696884	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.494101845272	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.363559331097	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.242178566841	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.420389788715	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.552796449049	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.313055161821	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.5	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.238643818496	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.535230630538	We don't win.
1.0	0.586938992543	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.576077248743	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.261791857885	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.379864339357	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.392421616135	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.237476798947	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.45001376216	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.54827034496	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.27757198477	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
1.0	0.620846565961	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.179980350469	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.295807188891	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.33929391802	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.463364444223	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.241296272062	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.459557993701	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.406013291226	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.367593217326	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.766046890809	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.593183398042	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.366620278922	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.105655632852	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.343813898772	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.32942968364	OK?
0.0	0.391351407915	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.647409082655	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.553928105881	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.472846470222	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.5	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.5	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.454289210417	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.710451754882	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.625842972862	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.184576765716	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.285803446535	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.338853464032	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.482533800303	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.644687704395	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.268046286596	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.598565702558	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
1.0	0.5290888637	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.662679591221	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.430101664497	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.445360972367	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.406252724751	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.510223191724	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.99391512396	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.213673335913	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.35747328556	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.166893010724	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.287309672126	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.565698428439	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.454440115514	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.524162669108	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.436979730822	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.207943253446	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.348837967538	So...
0.0	0.607333040966	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.270822319604	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.433215081139	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.368510332418	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.54742316175	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
1.0	0.42000409135	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.528767504082	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.464639971944	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.5	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.293760943393	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.465666551463	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.163309731406	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.413525033753	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.428330933825	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.435962868743	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.244835470167	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.514533450964	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.695073195769	You get the Senate.

0.0	0.52371631197	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.505940096366	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.167507161699	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.513013479633	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.299176182778	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.516529454316	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.

0.0	0.0776016801324	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
1.0	0.269135774538	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.164501244704	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.448100579003	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.459307404829	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.292599915682	You count on it.
0.0	0.384125396088	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
1.0	0.719034887247	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.17549356429	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.45859882716	That's my bill.
0.0	0.351815495094	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.594277713707	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
1.0	0.748970537037	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.400617551492	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.314070838966	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.271958311172	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.483432252096	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.178890099638	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.562980299354	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.487346947738	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.52245902448	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.403180228531	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.428497194989	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.

0.0	0.238946494461	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.366657252843	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.387932213337	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.76194652448	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.135839081532	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.537929703866	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.277992198298	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.408476723877	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.647511397649	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.332236554382	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.58437520177	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.89458660576	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.32942968364	Yeah.
0.0	0.382451700479	No.
0.0	0.347566165659	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.361905688344	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.105015168574	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.342401860756	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.550485681477	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.744035703001	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.413428791887	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.549269130736	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.654134367399	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.283081461763	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.54487341	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.42140759225	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.484753409993	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.5	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.592550321612	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.437958633059	You're right.
0.0	0.536519017639	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.416068555805	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.519346081661	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.459373745169	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.35509020854	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.6705226659	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.23653623174	Came out great.
0.0	0.387295123969	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.296896731615	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.318158896371	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.481023111451	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
1.0	0.34262205211	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.132421321691	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.886889358239	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.81919432838	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.476081881055	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.220138408096	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.352262075563	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.252595591103	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.345842416278	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.638011813764	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.453089620887	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.433412125755	I got that.
0.0	0.470193980643	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.366771560725	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.323419486805	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.670776140948	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.338673322076	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.772624101226	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.532804128618	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.589102921259	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.36368370307	See?
0.0	0.272184080078	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.359017422613	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.32942968364	OK?
0.0	0.228269022072	And here's why.
0.0	0.330848621862	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.461759808195	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.517694650189	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.0717569985864	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.360709708636	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.560946829149	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.440190003993	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.357725379459	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.412488543078	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
1.0	0.813638330535	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.605826681995	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.266730745744	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.262175177381	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.401194855528	Alright.
0.0	0.368775527312	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.548823571089	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.0749936922026	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.419366398199	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.709856030831	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.427666350427	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.146868022756	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.359196901508	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.648328242709	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
1.0	0.573627256204	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.674561429735	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.574634841658	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.35446051172	We need sound money.
0.0	0.367155302245	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.494291277757	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.363918038868	Think about it.
0.0	0.485770010303	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.387220569958	I don't like that.
0.0	0.27097289473	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.425635004516	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.866355262218	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.347752715668	Becky --
0.0	0.288965143584	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.512847105475	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.39923725088	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.213171275985	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.441687749653	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.219682006996	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
1.0	0.526469533485	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.106988764647	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.218261105595	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.439733483881	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.568204890778	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.413785538757	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.270945149391	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.475275597495	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.261674899936	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.210482407821	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.129132961724	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.365810141504	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
1.0	0.588340584035	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.201646199985	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.48314766365	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.619541007823	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.3375119644	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.411120722103	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.562747415208	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.45205421295	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.437958633059	You're right.
0.0	0.296829170758	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.485855291265	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.5	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.580072581539	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.409297943172	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.449335297733	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.32942968364	Yes.
0.0	0.359847083206	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.552498674153	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.421435710024	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.281108294131	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.340659897695	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.252325104735	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.340103210206	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.483890655978	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.465697797365	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.363833333666	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.443839966977	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.672309910322	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.30769976021	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.216505697962	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.59533614287	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.487944808205	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.413185864785	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.66815402834	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.438087379337	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.725633983369	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
1.0	0.839265914182	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.329352526234	Nobody can deny them.

0.0	0.416834229736	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.358989941796	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.322199455182	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.590406627888	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.54880989583	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.452726946712	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.432001165031	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.164820509825	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.513302462747	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.7208118106	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.430120402224	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.44460741017	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.316867072409	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.275316572022	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.525586875441	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.33049820308	Why is that?
0.0	0.397526699169	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.401654719745	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.281562234684	...
0.0	0.383574473281	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.26530953005	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.516686940146	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.39968615149	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.442455608747	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.395675791634	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.393767928536	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.200254430906	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.821987026453	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.559353139675	And you know what?
0.0	0.374691923746	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.304565642253	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.561967051385	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.483730165625	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.250413980334	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.87561520149	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.379946567689	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.126424449975	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.204209890951	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.28196166539	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.307181237896	How great is that?
0.0	0.578465193508	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.365574747494	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.370958195603	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
1.0	0.687257137167	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.531558635747	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.697778446431	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.366095106927	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.452361501779	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.331192165538	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.445583611724	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.32753674896	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.418977734038	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.435633018813	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.440114060181	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.275805237163	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.295885948813	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.368319670015	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.11856384805	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.261744106963	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.459683312037	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.616743392202	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.480316424233	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.307519970173	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.542628710364	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.482315318499	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.291308800372	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.21282346296	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.39245446008	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.524259711728	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.47130210793	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.618543060035	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.455960471273	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.5	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.669039786513	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.309467607422	It's not working.
0.0	0.290536693071	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.511336537411	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.421370537964	You know why three?
0.0	0.46624124045	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.563675961079	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.381277512206	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.318221750155	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.534968270896	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.682009483525	We need to reform Social Security.
1.0	0.469964160034	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.5	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.365681534639	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.413565590747	He does great.
0.0	0.271384264536	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.491193657505	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.545977456643	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.45290958864	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.257749372449	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.419992401897	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.401307493732	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.481865665128	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1.0	0.488422137163	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.423962178448	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.508476209217	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.507713825642	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
1.0	0.5	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.395895779057	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.364609432013	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
1.0	0.749153838043	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.575599655154	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.610057481884	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.343420819292	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.25647604295	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.410726603405	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.0709994521746	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.328513081556	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.426922285854	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.422655306841	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.210687658315	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.155009029548	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.675437217129	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.450114823056	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.223299134456	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.5	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.363605943736	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.884422237071	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.330033004421	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.295586032856	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.264501224077	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.20436219187	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.391547202339	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.404891032947	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.478723296975	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.371511888022	Let's talk about our campaigns.
1.0	0.306442209153	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.34142202853	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.573361459096	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.383392781365	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.619613274214	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.602195385693	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.302129632607	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.452734054253	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.445397309464	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.243801420221	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.550055987964	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.5	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.411214269533	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.48204642024	She was right.
0.0	0.357575047365	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.409822504979	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.540221665309	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.509036124556	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.451447823057	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.351420470155	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.193687412949	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.540800206813	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.592096519391	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
1.0	0.36602182665	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.356474356016	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.191914530972	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.31410618515	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.352996389894	I have...
0.0	0.233747542911	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.430870290569	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.509534898203	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.420526838342	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.456057949744	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.623654741263	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.357885545595	You know why?
0.0	0.408639787961	And we are not England.
0.0	0.329337371516	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.275136198429	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.62164056798	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.456010652768	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.356040018275	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.475777436235	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.240580786501	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.569466451348	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.3164141518	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.5	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.32917875277	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.22259009608	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.220094053278	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.386436723114	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.317742072544	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.472541515122	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.763904409877	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.514609353996	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.559026276802	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.670745780805	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.771795252713	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.267121049562	And why?
0.0	0.339861201107	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.512366596248	You're simply not.
0.0	0.523373082171	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.283051917165	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.515115842832	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.340495917351	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.542072542443	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.302682393514	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.458144712691	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
1.0	0.49362367399	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.260172303796	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.230854715006	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.554943243003	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.392094168553	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.607212427591	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.373498965234	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.359500922744	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.337140632058	I will do that in Washington.
1.0	0.588227830558	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.433203235668	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.44708771747	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.401348094151	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.368553077189	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.143020070447	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.576903745628	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.302003416936	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.376389300815	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.435615736381	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.344889590939	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.548997493381	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.144376560521	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.429327773527	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.411493148106	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.604508895021	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.541394805623	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.296548381393	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.0769892177706	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.366708128733	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.527402276504	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.446028518063	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.648144142073	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.423953881359	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.313768725205	I'll say this.
0.0	0.217529275135	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.460411503171	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.604496739797	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.378831627322	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.584939550799	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.581504334253	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.58415433645	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.414775104837	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.316546888875	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.417566843017	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.356875395836	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
1.0	0.682742008615	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.306224552033	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.612814053644	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.189069645781	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.249275671783	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.539842051645	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.602536230849	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.550955933431	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.364539596616	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.246587228186	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.528909351823	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.16362056273	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
1.0	0.304513244041	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.312339023138	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.532345301337	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.3654795071	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.437457135009	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.442692577919	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.543659042784	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.714297295447	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.465554992286	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.127956652248	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.473189829158	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.727904593412	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.269428694064	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.37570775516	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.295372398272	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.311412147036	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.263522352999	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.518823825228	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.522715879964	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.451665970079	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.244419222913	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.423732878514	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.263935354505	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.309813349613	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.536845475427	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.444688515717	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.557910922253	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.47653861304	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.448214951288	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.273293077282	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.437089059133	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.654523387942	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.396132089362	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.376110118507	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.430560006971	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.515102860546	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.441452228447	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.444290180566	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.53818069375	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.59175774895	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.463053007945	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.547861417384	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.382451700479	No.
0.0	0.393213473387	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.605813137895	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.437880084593	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.523097002879	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.413449032424	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.436568433272	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.524192988988	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.331647146804	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.480316424233	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.5	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.322043838938	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.490392632394	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.181418309335	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.468479654646	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.463355323931	See, here's the thing.
1.0	0.521969904435	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.559353139675	And you know what?
0.0	0.612048316091	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.31713901109	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.305126134509	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.392956771251	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.370864740367	Thank you.
0.0	0.284130843723	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.401557972449	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.460869121169	Now, you've got Europe.
1.0	0.610199467873	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.330196243628	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.390361841774	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.521976978864	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.511049116407	That's what I said.
0.0	0.410007961475	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.300391841939	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.596388772785	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.849032062928	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.385050442829	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.407407685571	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.156118429273	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.530020728752	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.417075814828	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.517467434002	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.210638812007	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.400364115618	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.593319564486	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.516129707524	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.449933005143	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.486935178419	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.371124664181	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.313290778531	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.299809355216	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.368042640005	I was the architect.
0.0	0.336532335758	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.148241241705	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.795452860768	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.23382767018	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.208645611193	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.434971331246	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.523944990602	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.415684726766	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.466476058549	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.415886160908	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.22566628136	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.334580688919	...Chris...
1.0	0.888546933077	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.487300872473	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.418688683081	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.313503728804	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.291590691643	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.438185489157	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.473340163516	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.373851146871	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.479067202408	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.367272169246	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.576956219083	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.1805692124	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.38149918781	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.574913218447	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.481763912171	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.430775421032	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.697069523107	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.478283551326	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.341142179349	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.588754313948	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.359793336474	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.520378705585	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.12236834958	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.175722872659	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.246826233451	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.439241234192	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.485131430217	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.3104931997	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.331194247481	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.468099372709	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.0945219650173	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.253646889449	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.728355254215	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.622813412743	He just writes out an executive order.
