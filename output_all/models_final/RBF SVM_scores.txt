0.0	0.338940665194	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.561668447468	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.189495740757	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.399281683596	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.342454826464	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.29767968802	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.486486050517	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.680015354805	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.639665048367	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.321341984546	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.433245049012	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.330671053746	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.717202507817	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.468556146628	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.15512778036	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.521482466638	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.730410443269	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.303761350218	This is 2016.
0.0	0.241714288417	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.426373606675	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.630582342595	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.768105614233	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.63166964451	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.19065561409	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.203142127954	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.133003269454	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.51233133134	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.16414354357	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.36335300275	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.314219611824	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.283981908963	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.424231227738	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.762582639875	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.20669976231	I'm ready.
0.0	0.396326565918	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.231184500129	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.421537413498	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.232869375847	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.333869625734	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.344776013036	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.40993352068	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.194339231322	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.272788898415	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.221181929659	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.213461194856	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.249694605807	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
1.0	0.538259016037	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.205483407747	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.136200980558	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.547210242252	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.363245167458	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.569237296355	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.227219033534	No.
0.0	0.45248878129	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.146376617249	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.288425429987	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.323181269686	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.233246250093	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.457670235264	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.476848449482	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.185192678982	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.23805067886	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.305852538441	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.266675479362	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
1.0	0.688633303944	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.222786119864	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.316036802803	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.210001909357	They're absolutely false.
1.0	0.921167311427	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.251367889268	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.565278855888	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.230329125507	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.411824949138	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.392115212362	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.207133519438	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.133803371978	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.54366094204	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.226940526219	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.478293415362	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.717364868241	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.624059900452	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.317855668867	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.237980954847	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.209558893356	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.231927960604	And here's why.
0.0	0.605657593896	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
1.0	0.748787985525	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.665806845708	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.271503774541	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.938813503676	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.394904808399	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.263986577443	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.268125602834	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.751730469252	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
1.0	0.693091521627	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.229942163475	...
0.0	0.581658026026	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.454036791357	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.608244850198	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.289040925463	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.395472326667	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.273111751485	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.348074462459	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.302103020128	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.238412659996	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.36166560365	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.831871439381	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.301220417385	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.184452472777	He's wrong.
0.0	0.749412550668	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.468883255757	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.293901540466	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.690443349662	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.64678249208	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.313967055081	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.267380956413	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.57949512025	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.52694991382	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.266534538789	Good at email.
0.0	0.520800429817	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.62294777508	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.38185310115	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.342561732919	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.698889173453	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.241256091081	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.647992222887	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.519496272635	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.511926394859	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.630508663731	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.742873806819	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.730296267912	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.312119272939	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.162816920644	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.661139276309	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.983062319534	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.398584998051	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.414690781173	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.225536474094	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.220999106696	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.309399444339	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.37344707597	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.433684090962	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.385258665273	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.233280967551	Yes.
0.0	0.155395770549	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.457399763907	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.677675906991	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.189081967658	But, here is the truth.
1.0	0.292418922442	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.245248475471	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.20241974814	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.817151299278	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.839194523385	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.230798968506	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.482350936121	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.345571140047	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.312393050411	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.175445543877	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.78982706351	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.163628745136	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.674984698834	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.220332286923	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.319645082832	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.256900315259	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.250205207064	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.213070232087	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.27082468946	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.199308948878	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.650012719267	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.264259709488	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.631683775142	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.531140796	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.395185759637	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.234675047344	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.267900485225	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.254166939097	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.825430296801	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.423152756366	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.439128835995	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.240034383793	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.219072263281	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.298249011015	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.774782511661	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.252895233881	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.494502580903	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.539211668609	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
1.0	0.307470066816	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.328865071692	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.181953572687	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.271077809956	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.416369137598	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.642232497406	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.705206380119	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.222709906426	It never happens.
0.0	0.402336181997	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.

0.0	0.181246277238	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.366076564102	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.281616108474	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.753718911417	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.220834465637	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.

0.0	0.25751731876	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.241995916877	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.19399509636	And you know what?
1.0	0.282914232665	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.

0.0	0.384097368289	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.489246687306	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.458848603147	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.29128198481	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.

0.0	0.269517284844	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.564263961903	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.348665433361	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.

0.0	0.263711880332	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.675620387577	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.874563374818	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.

0.0	0.242921315306	(LAUGHTER)

0.0	0.151235687184	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.244593960942	That's fine.
0.0	0.250073512012	I'm tested.
0.0	0.285459850166	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.38550169882	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.268846758706	And, we said no.
0.0	0.22347864223	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.335945509118	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.414251856359	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.428159268579	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.505832865058	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.225778624803	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.66204768155	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.291277111741	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.849369411922	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.328032093892	I will show you what they do to women.
1.0	0.415773463973	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.392118912784	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.198655075113	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.327908515889	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.30868374803	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.426908652758	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.586423130108	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.243291804103	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.366635820244	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.463567770905	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.618207198285	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.51516434743	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
1.0	0.550552889646	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.713218743499	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.185551017593	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.19671064068	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.546669736095	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.671526170454	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.778887598079	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.1806574986	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.39521661682	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.217059139584	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.401071295003	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.295862440719	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.290152292791	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.381457785674	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.194190876942	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.240085614188	And for good cause.
0.0	0.551066581807	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.734496063948	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.759738643465	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.379283367153	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.201764281915	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.372004063422	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.399711467284	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.674991920489	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.359927388479	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.586421075739	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.160777904042	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.157043074445	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.564833523788	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.382259859462	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.585118623655	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
1.0	0.832592369721	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.739147634251	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.222213249915	You count on it.
0.0	0.718361590698	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.534466376807	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.441454850832	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.55089055312	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.224045779058	Divide that out.
0.0	0.55656496714	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.862089878132	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.352809417569	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.200103822313	I like it.
0.0	0.21163256563	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.393333159183	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.259208600369	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.360618128785	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.772904588954	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.191093790672	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.192703417361	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.13190689579	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.587116817243	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.41627101282	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.524404649254	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.292198423837	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.291315380375	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.415306047755	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.385395318169	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.602162701553	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.362729722975	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.602896322858	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.568554268512	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.568282585429	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.571893513317	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.608143593133	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.25665340148	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.26142802475	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.212327432863	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.348043558299	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.727627370564	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.369897035116	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.492019535264	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.305406449562	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.273970706623	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.583662070901	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.287000812119	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.250669062243	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.245776111849	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.663225927465	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.351994853475	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.259753757967	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.183923772036	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.331671479014	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.401654203434	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.229824704472	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.567096276883	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.106517527298	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.64091481384	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.748787985525	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.656947840729	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.44167251858	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.687689491718	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.350587780383	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.463575067422	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.876136405409	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.848062373972	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.339526985211	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.18541756303	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.197290829558	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.625176095227	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.204498612068	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.486533715739	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.638377732968	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.651940121833	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.468622035645	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.430244130707	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.657019114303	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.19432171677	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.149623560709	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.31796500603	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.22525296721	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.936317268201	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.227972468982	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.16243081499	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.315658695265	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.195565188164	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.174608351841	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.199214574322	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.663386878763	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.595633996051	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.58819924415	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.51637918314	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.408952759952	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.454643245067	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.632324850247	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.344024288439	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.220442109686	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.739179708443	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.174321553163	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.291685147695	...income tax...
1.0	0.5	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.170644606696	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.200616833808	I understand.
0.0	0.515658068851	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.660993996874	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.216601422978	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.205483308873	We don't win.
0.0	0.608965661639	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.640370560057	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.104614468916	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.365781072489	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.381960795808	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.316721603648	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.160102853913	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.5	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.213002742525	I will not do that.
0.0	0.419260722979	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.331465900984	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.228723949832	We're running.
0.0	0.701608868485	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.45858805184	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.349469534419	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.242747924825	Absolutely.
0.0	0.626438440974	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.239555841355	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.36731159047	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.434406557141	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.479967226356	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.650887303756	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.287833870853	We have a country of borders.

0.0	0.635681175092	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.361199422581	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.277603223828	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.5	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.38117376198	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.231044901953	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.227264325462	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.467964731663	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.229942163475	...
0.0	0.336621582162	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.529584119211	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.328584198901	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.816292482491	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.24633595212	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.797152144266	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.909938052989	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.344620812682	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.575175559743	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.461195806501	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.382957792904	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.24698834472	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.418622133784	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.251601528144	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.390015890864	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.749551482426	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.174709078073	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.951136747437	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.776691600156	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.220430136888	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.28571591757	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.343097775175	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.264915722272	The number of women --
0.0	0.527992513613	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.234024823466	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.521119353615	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.240258440888	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.215066293094	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.247940167253	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.751375681807	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.590834071538	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.731366970171	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.225337063396	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.741406936703	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.398985082333	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.836905860395	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.259036057253	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.632471128285	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.42244432784	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.446580838908	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.439090826247	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.909753095787	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.564420381916	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.937406805409	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.244320870004	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.209951541157	How great is that?
0.0	0.675102489539	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.922776378244	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.240667112923	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.461222278432	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.210577683935	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.68729209266	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.731427494513	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.166003607775	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.248276989123	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.237839030005	We're friends.
0.0	0.710186389482	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
1.0	0.615302866028	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.522331385155	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.617932551579	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.27710884477	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.227277982263	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.299403421188	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.687566638207	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.5	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.47989255097	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.331969684361	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.581130396413	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.315115292127	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.32182519658	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.208214865006	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.607694792021	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.647865388997	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.384446265714	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.750498609999	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.379419048182	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.169866767154	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.642063384668	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.627648688241	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.208944692352	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.722759970678	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
1.0	0.974322752635	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.463472539664	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.424319178684	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.217929980799	in particular.
0.0	0.216669620772	Thank you.
0.0	0.236327397479	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.523670335855	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.205856158754	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.639426481357	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.186049033913	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.463193160352	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.215366243656	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.216669620772	Thank you.
0.0	0.189227051634	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.505114660924	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.476190783546	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.345515390465	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.394650653553	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.854292997138	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.814812616824	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.292518923303	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.375242174071	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.683935985948	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.183073391034	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.223934594392	The answer is no.
0.0	0.514943413878	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.227219033534	No.
0.0	0.676906682579	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.530626489181	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.458762449467	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.592935854591	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.650513748453	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.628844896833	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.228403326545	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.336950994068	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.93572113346	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.366781673688	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.520751586404	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.2598795067	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.425406810878	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.33359393938	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.148600673755	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.442921480226	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.28966276623	Of course not.
0.0	0.225969559442	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.756843454203	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.421799686584	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.476765666324	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.315839447332	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.680884174832	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.606666853125	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.143759707385	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.32043257007	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.233280967551	OK.
0.0	0.5	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.237539488331	They're a scam.
0.0	0.447965126384	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.259096449983	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.630862218214	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.221052505019	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.33795341396	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.216752957585	We can't do it.
0.0	0.302183618593	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.743017810806	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.729215127392	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.284247210185	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.479332828973	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.284333013025	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.322783970794	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.297334237598	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.536237904224	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.570945426418	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.346761954433	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.229476152102	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.36241296586	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.246653472291	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.278473144786	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.354159129604	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.178612141404	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.347448929983	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.525563344106	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.235330483239	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.392022169809	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.401404974894	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.241995916877	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.309155061531	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.186949185921	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.554123666236	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.591469184014	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.185967001824	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.259876628961	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.520862514534	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.832931218105	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.371969440467	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.161923860317	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.259110730442	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.322614492944	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.727828415648	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.283875233305	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.448980461638	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
1.0	0.80959453287	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.419282489462	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.721916726318	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.662778749172	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.316124511567	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.247561615587	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.180507862687	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.21260233223	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.644668852623	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.234655461215	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.221686250331	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.340327889561	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.287833870853	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.577581473241	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.230552539719	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.677637911273	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.229812897241	I promise.
0.0	0.680511458963	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.72708721168	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.584087737864	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.229942163475	...
0.0	0.246895740399	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.205643671604	He undermines it.
0.0	0.507169978125	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.603245037667	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.192950430932	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.912117982633	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.636995492629	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.443802783924	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.282597495414	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.269830492876	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.28655204041	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.821463544049	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.422387530367	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.229942163475	...
0.0	0.707195732659	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.546772994842	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.333536572979	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.289167215081	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.730276832591	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.1991307353	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.347216942667	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.283675761222	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
1.0	0.826028946838	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.262664150443	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.398526473903	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.238171145708	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.178731350207	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.283537204221	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.810814047365	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.573430233602	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.300363774749	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.296345304367	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.513106412698	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.59527321347	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.392602934795	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.315552011537	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.280990717878	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.610613242151	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.17746853506	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.481366079685	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.379074229306	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.335856522084	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.507071437708	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.193278943692	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.312698652791	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.255216647118	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.5	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.779364160033	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.318263486195	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.250784700511	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.5	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.826649980372	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.198200624043	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.302527576911	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.740993835629	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.278458762696	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.186616925417	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.247430570667	We are not France.
0.0	0.40582583161	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.768280016838	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.683752174153	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.316562287665	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.41885850169	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.485648661312	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.302258143882	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.557138417558	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.582416528976	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.47524670808	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.322958850799	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
1.0	0.839343831165	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.183003516383	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.398842283885	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.827098530932	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.188944310072	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.509913051311	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.33308204402	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.352047231935	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.67034899173	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.461425579041	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.661288736042	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.305944998168	I didn't.
0.0	0.440827038918	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.379533807636	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.258884641845	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.307563850202	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.441824779959	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.467787524728	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.61134431386	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.18918337336	I think he is right.
0.0	0.222987382301	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.204662607167	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.169569006242	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.304314958106	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.5	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.307502384301	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.373089209552	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.346622820781	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.618389888645	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.689478966889	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.739227328625	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.249380994294	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.269692789153	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.567430809378	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.169888106802	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.236883407457	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.24678161826	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.231153171473	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.223104599602	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.42827419553	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.257716582927	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.67310065079	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.639799097384	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.26361228586	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.353926696052	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.

0.0	0.468031058078	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.696427407728	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.63283758252	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.226768472844	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.631544173613	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.122842425293	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
1.0	0.423451033837	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.552279930292	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.449185035743	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.216669620772	Thank you.

0.0	0.517944120562	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.217470415076	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.274860550339	They're a mile away from here.
1.0	0.776018301243	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.316465388588	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.763055149618	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.197512759741	And...
0.0	0.701273808672	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
1.0	0.6466543287	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.280591099618	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.

0.0	0.767461411157	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.182816421649	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.519966078126	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.900757931495	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.

0.0	0.428680906789	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.28329327426	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.519296839439	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.367600125077	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.381475402203	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.224451341981	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.531475779461	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.700934510394	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.419019343641	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.294738176104	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.437021224098	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.

0.0	0.52453313265	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.511027439533	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.38067319	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.389202164088	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.451114572341	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...

0.0	0.265186119709	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.483856452238	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.613662068414	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.713126528938	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.830076252191	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.417410183931	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.265901545752	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.204784829842	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.317764364385	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.400798245833	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.57829116219	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.870000968958	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.712612150594	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.

0.0	0.258258302242	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.164939419354	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.199655497211	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.320929939268	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.342680559711	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.434116245919	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.48686715548	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.403446912031	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.71800599221	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
1.0	0.384631043916	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.265366676052	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.334317362877	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.367404255219	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.440610390941	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.449965221602	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.253558329705	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
1.0	0.62847575774	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.662095991483	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.605533560482	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.294175090166	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.207497203493	I love China.
0.0	0.213318015618	They're Muslim.

0.0	0.592786106481	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.879745530905	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.581381057906	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.770083173313	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.217146636343	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.173339438584	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.638944797408	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.17388066527	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.20363112467	These...
0.0	0.4915920055	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.459996995082	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.278398012231	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.557755475154	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.365474590874	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.228128428178	You get together.
0.0	0.29819370304	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
1.0	0.75609801415	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.662107563876	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.396757670957	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.417378387815	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.556286970774	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.870679113557	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.486915299759	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.317727526783	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.295446794413	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.232499748281	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.77934367103	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.419314943747	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.573248565322	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.564782470311	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.291349376444	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.485737822797	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.22437777195	I have no idea.

1.0	0.647567675057	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.548324631394	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.587505449117	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.578852099202	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.874105061696	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.60413030029	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.

0.0	0.216135343783	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.473932155901	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.246823748417	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.

0.0	0.186075816673	It's true.
0.0	0.541744595381	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.526934970495	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.220159462924	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.518664721943	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.252821788906	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.

0.0	0.231220970471	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.728692969525	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.

0.0	0.312539927745	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.70473222653	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.

0.0	0.400628103271	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.275561415074	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.506580605881	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.

0.0	0.664436257556	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.211205206677	Well, sure.
0.0	0.577593962136	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.141500855033	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.

0.0	0.153738005224	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
1.0	0.589954136944	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.671802619336	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.234938977773	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.705183950512	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.301835066067	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.380798750905	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.427846259504	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.242887911765	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.640221752986	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.656768215166	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.294867326326	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.716544942501	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.380201942424	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.431525253964	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.47033019385	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.643538446994	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.387613715164	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.217489103665	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.184447550769	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.512716455591	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.721002716399	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.798575011478	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.749372625031	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.742985873697	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.387401382987	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.304112279204	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.355773874399	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.469455334864	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.598631653773	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.225867128151	Say again?
0.0	0.191712490529	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.212130993174	They know.
0.0	0.234833112198	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.239756298925	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.24980275931	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.234171011927	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.291268518392	It was.
0.0	0.610814972713	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.466465711576	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.573782312931	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.555728266614	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.223351803035	I do.
1.0	0.699823547809	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.186919842001	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.171433282976	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.280059838777	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.68908021306	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.276995982174	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.536791767903	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.125976209297	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.159443542546	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.300087056644	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.210493233045	We need sound money.
0.0	0.564867776606	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.262931664129	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.419575877303	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.329891970296	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.673495034702	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.651660861585	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.210493233045	We need sound money.
0.0	0.349184460367	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.215245924119	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.142312619986	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.281524683312	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.242628616138	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.375096809151	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.585046266389	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.171316365702	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.71043176791	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.488194467535	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.246782263763	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
1.0	0.304903768226	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.586135821897	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.214651818628	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.200736779684	That's not right.
0.0	0.601527239212	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.283946764202	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.595367612206	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.668654442251	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.233280967551	Yeah.
0.0	0.520040581098	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.245395960209	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.266179203686	The world has changed.
0.0	0.377083096094	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.48333709718	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.35105965966	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.251226596097	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.262722272512	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.5	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.448902236221	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.551260263933	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.544606079845	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.330229921427	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.200736779684	That's not right.
0.0	0.430426380764	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.3645671331	She voted for it.
0.0	0.188312062459	And guess what?
0.0	0.250446431277	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.197829946323	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.199952184683	I have...
0.0	0.269950003869	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.189022642019	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.553290879384	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.158946763138	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.304561647187	I changed that.
0.0	0.276043556983	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.202766381255	I can do that.
0.0	0.222533773206	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.183786726394	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.909313589788	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.649820088461	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.481582832354	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.715639242787	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.268549921936	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.396873950095	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.395603035267	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.299557417207	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.745983302902	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.19251190508	...John...
0.0	0.404281236574	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.821749486834	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.239663947933	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.805513978757	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.270346175412	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.279287813024	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.457266099437	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.575631991647	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.257604148133	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.578755010109	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.357124586064	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.636651275125	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.262733260585	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.20706810414	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.514631969238	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.448062079989	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.186434274075	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.329808870246	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.732881594176	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.342319057757	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.385744815746	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.491847811842	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.233297382006	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.172495633804	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.147012474573	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.462048637107	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.277670007263	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.536118662289	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.212362350455	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.202989102215	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.203600095444	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.0974238295358	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.241930451363	He has never defended...
0.0	0.223351803035	We do.
0.0	0.27720678137	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.750257465083	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.228541321302	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.466034254295	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.638266555622	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.219086006775	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.251180387369	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.228405594604	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.267514857211	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.879823582038	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.663892443197	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.264295382452	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.235544855792	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.246932990556	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.226038066972	No their not.
0.0	0.564408031615	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.260574501024	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.191428727278	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.603380002431	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.208552562733	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.225190440252	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
1.0	0.240960148759	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.219131496284	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.418036000024	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.22640815405	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.243488116752	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.515965802998	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.233280967551	OK?
0.0	0.375217981077	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.421058257683	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.265573346658	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.375946204965	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.14903750205	Listen, I want to just comment.
1.0	0.207264617113	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.285157235645	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.597866310096	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.246712711947	I've done it.
0.0	0.316562287665	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.172998053444	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.218436769954	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.729753437169	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.28838862908	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.481138369459	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.300376466546	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.319689749159	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.548938162988	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.245984476569	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.311208767077	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.332719686864	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.263464632248	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
1.0	0.478094097132	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.210834895842	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.431516675894	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.352730088875	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.36120032739	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.438673892797	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.33000560066	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.239005946421	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.491903744616	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.5	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.60522632006	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.409634019572	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.657039013562	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.345218752125	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.268370640558	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.187615233208	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.338340209882	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.165671060377	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.293530756147	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.195470538614	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.859590943907	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.23149172243	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.462365038206	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.348738642726	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.207426476616	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.181987162218	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.514541925144	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.671076107261	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.35544432542	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.406253005231	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.221814067507	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.790810779508	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.21295408893	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.388385569073	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.403882911867	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.233964487569	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.455803529227	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.441637136608	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.242158599248	It's their money.
0.0	0.340696194913	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.468646479798	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.201784960184	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.483215443807	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.341202968713	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.323292427482	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.513438082997	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.330017436658	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.358293324676	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.856429968874	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.249924695458	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.817434469254	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.374303132972	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.932603988669	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.218838366864	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.237294356888	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.665240050409	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.403837360786	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.512885230147	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.372804247837	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.310269091827	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.269821461334	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.712428624093	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.284911285376	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.220682680446	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.539602585998	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.795548217716	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
1.0	0.699999492539	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.733746046688	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
1.0	0.568946838606	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.614236316705	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.419944953256	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.207920751338	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.373181545114	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.814555996738	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.251612860845	Our country doesn't win anymore.
1.0	0.876066225767	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.

0.0	0.46797928789	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.405374831875	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.350347007061	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.5	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.436680157332	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.473008068534	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.237616281741	My background is different.
0.0	0.349459570336	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.734383970585	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.298859272559	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.257304018491	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.361608188245	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.403701620856	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.

0.0	0.801860455565	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.271911931507	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.343731789411	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.26647768619	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.480945480293	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.253502433721	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.465739931272	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.577144805857	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.5	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.239344352802	That will change everything.
0.0	0.322892090828	I never said that.
0.0	0.485182469979	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.339882140833	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.372161509763	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.628322143044	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.195918715004	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.330907387703	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.285114862008	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.256096181985	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.203987263988	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.67913696338	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.424311760377	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.380947805331	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.5686862261	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.682452745512	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.425322509271	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.669028489088	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.510865313033	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.212997888304	Let me (inaudible).

0.0	0.369842343706	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.219232666672	I win.
0.0	0.440364552751	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.222709906426	It never happens.
0.0	0.491591962917	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.163803921643	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.354096442364	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.235528219238	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.321479271704	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.556413489352	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.

0.0	0.288501317879	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.367547672156	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.247772137922	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.478431125843	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.428583249067	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.880152683643	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.310319689535	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.516092694021	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.791090777014	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.246997675222	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.26136251969	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.36240539914	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.792977370638	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.264303394463	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.29613729162	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.448323694989	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.

0.0	0.264553709796	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.359698228214	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
1.0	0.856902234739	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.186330619515	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.16965813441	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.785300200096	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.397150749318	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.144770900435	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.19599828755	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.731857477118	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.

0.0	0.293667504396	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.348725829662	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.19399509636	And you know what?
0.0	0.70229151738	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.216840191435	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.213672419624	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.746447150626	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.229489337127	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.25319128685	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.798199098758	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.921362160679	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.47163160598	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.541992109424	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.351116406559	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.47310869668	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
1.0	0.404468997727	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.622118024037	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
1.0	0.723164019644	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.636997324501	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.573344536701	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.556818633311	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.698892730302	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.422634180909	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.227219033534	No.
0.0	0.234167276541	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.459211989493	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.446300869974	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.707930618465	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.615576301621	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.71012076407	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.778934472409	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.163334797884	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.374379341466	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.423891212057	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.203865263098	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.273364456749	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.232470481902	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.64475879597	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.550550804896	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.249098709898	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.576925073865	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.354040864973	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.321043545694	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.757789798804	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
1.0	0.708224204779	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.657207084745	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.310728157904	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.359944378234	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.29978335483	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.768378557498	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.543318098113	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.333751330452	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.26910689793	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.250670554364	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.561816274196	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.465823519724	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.472275184904	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.229405275019	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.151566997934	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.266091543	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
1.0	0.82037119146	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.865311590078	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.298963269317	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.373168123171	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.217959982619	So...
0.0	0.41842218098	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.874725007712	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.226841392824	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.34079009728	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.646018127783	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.353013282839	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.216669620772	Thank you.
0.0	0.377144866824	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.484200108183	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.270471651811	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.56053826426	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.20339421706	Can we stop?
0.0	0.354153654424	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.284323429322	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.228626533335	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.525214225048	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.258112811297	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.201366791272	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.607744747506	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.69636837752	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.667309177193	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.256827892787	slot.
0.0	0.4170005453	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.468611720475	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.38881487884	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.224254222791	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.202566942678	I'll say this.
1.0	0.79916382044	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.617670072866	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.770434574421	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
1.0	0.827624839842	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.364737721496	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
1.0	0.678371837414	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.356339307326	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
1.0	0.269248488789	They were wrong.
0.0	0.242420464941	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
1.0	0.698134689783	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.384342006045	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.480112058632	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.679093284967	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.646594723672	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.352098240635	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.873353733939	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.252896179477	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.19399509636	And you know what?
0.0	0.368517515186	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.41535696006	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.188376042947	That's good.
1.0	0.742467226155	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.279840718876	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.160621524214	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.223771442502	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.795509299867	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.166313610348	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.370250838223	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.514241030106	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.304134673981	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.209768769939	This will end.
0.0	0.512838999515	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.677489236364	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.518416323265	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.216669620772	Thank you.
0.0	0.512456366848	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.220905127864	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.401081986284	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.678819712969	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.133423086307	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.526412848432	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.202438483725	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.843073134828	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.265656394849	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.619926313975	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.229795666358	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.669837801984	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
1.0	0.540141146245	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.207155373224	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.671837434156	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.566116471546	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.335790150361	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.527939432589	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.198842124453	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.248143511573	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.484112862703	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.563752021892	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.475492963307	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.505884206823	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.825216436594	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.65296199308	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.330042289879	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.15087810228	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.408059177751	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.338747955434	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.264337583315	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.5	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.240874745459	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.608677880033	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.762364745373	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.178383724127	They don't like that.
0.0	0.557694839595	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.73918512246	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.877310505915	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.492137177621	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.590976810145	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.33989873296	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.527206222819	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.290769254615	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.367783170739	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.407412060806	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.217435266907	And why?
0.0	0.235085154152	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.298810998147	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.36096242856	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.183591658669	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.250307301731	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.378227189077	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.74076274035	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.45607883388	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.143159492344	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.287527593511	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.425320543793	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.569852493618	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.327610708198	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.197857523649	That's for sure.
0.0	0.551081858796	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.205747956025	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.246643983757	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.236960690339	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.254113004409	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.563524607996	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.38858652858	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.49183633303	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.380887255827	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.224989320321	My point is this.
0.0	0.3591933735	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.200247087204	You find me...
0.0	0.512915461821	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.225487695415	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.506817072915	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.396247102667	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.560678053209	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.431250532915	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.317716081609	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.268243535133	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.722849130969	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.5	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.22122862335	See?
0.0	0.362660362919	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.320667736115	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.320705883489	But I was born here.
0.0	0.273794601126	The time to turn the page is now.
1.0	0.541504484985	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.121830276024	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.216940000881	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.647585234439	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.448874043463	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.6012034999	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.236064534736	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.76971495097	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.610488644815	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.381076359029	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.625225256402	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.204533785438	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.251973104732	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.19399509636	And you know what?
0.0	0.389302748191	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.493462552188	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.431951154886	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.189321288274	It feels different.
0.0	0.239234824389	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.402688051206	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.595564228742	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.459723482994	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.411705065314	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.737741497694	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.202509241603	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.144018817441	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.364499200138	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.389165747328	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.225698814397	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.359832013564	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.698034316123	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.24339715336	That's what I've always stood for.
1.0	0.854484806539	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.329047840462	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
1.0	0.608187139134	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.702147718429	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
1.0	0.808724221055	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.311350573849	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.508841563394	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.702255420925	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
1.0	0.490809987752	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.391945627949	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.224690556451	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.479921207787	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.222744217848	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.227219033534	No.
0.0	0.203153298415	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.721345031752	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.210771214092	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.372515398626	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
1.0	0.584547962661	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.766679385874	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.296704216553	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.858644387099	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.19655677386	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.5	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.865387288869	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.394804607823	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.233280967551	Yes.
0.0	0.264307215437	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.241304827211	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.269315698114	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.317131113828	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.320522171742	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.25474578504	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.205206696042	In all due respect...
0.0	0.368646280666	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.236013848178	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.24093192255	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.345334306006	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.288753791994	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.617170749943	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.73823164498	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.233280967551	OK?
0.0	0.293628230651	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.427148331752	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.287617508373	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.163427858132	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.374300542072	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.142832403965	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.392169505858	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.627602694273	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.275655286077	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.312422275131	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.28013614344	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.303073541902	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.574834902574	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.698333487811	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.245163358895	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.230305481534	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.69373585811	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.248072166843	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.229942163475	...
0.0	0.227219033534	No.
0.0	0.308504734169	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.316923590458	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.407837030951	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.631957875895	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.517676560692	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.208202392235	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.74267025821	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.243178434416	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.520579022895	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.648303242507	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.295085112979	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.835255467658	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.534922484298	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.28406882817	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.197512759741	But...
0.0	0.764125657847	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.273063816984	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.796500340515	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.833555138815	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.261407849389	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.472922045663	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
1.0	0.223651807504	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.639115062592	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.202566942678	I will do that.
0.0	0.664364008939	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.777348389044	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.296579993932	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.320403647214	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.328252050768	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.206655641181	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.478555734474	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.257099056043	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.306115863411	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.227039740764	They're a scam.
0.0	0.307057581616	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.352054943738	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.738761193493	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.217936241451	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.714790142413	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.211339675681	You know why?
0.0	0.129370504968	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.408192745798	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.201410267741	Just want to get that out there, just saying.

0.0	0.59347526394	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.73564528734	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.38859320313	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.266728845206	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.545304092544	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.580804278865	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.

0.0	0.423017452337	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.279499284714	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.171201849362	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.246781892534	That never works.
0.0	0.278894751283	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.800685246411	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.200380823499	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.245124575462	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.251509246133	They know we will be committed to victory.

0.0	0.332160903628	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.221961155294	And God bless America.
0.0	0.332926669847	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.911423472523	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.465359812197	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.481251970741	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.278896816688	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.434444027713	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.232602910267	No, John.
0.0	0.184795408129	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.379862197743	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.44774976392	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.334525707207	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.488892879736	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.206193997354	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.

0.0	0.252937218406	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.381747682394	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.328813110467	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.247735125248	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.528939579385	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.670011187912	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.368500666915	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.342712772172	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.376101310552	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.281574532299	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.350895120431	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.267559841111	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.203816326046	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.28862583592	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.223351803035	I have.
0.0	0.235784991919	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.41561835329	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.291480848365	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.735144687753	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.225014239452	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.211206881055	It's a joke.
0.0	0.253190486451	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.48238070949	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.13094772295	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.459343597979	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.34290093868	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.297120976356	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.339580148556	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.455097212046	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.360290895546	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.714234182702	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.3583498647	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?

0.0	0.211911346546	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.268844472493	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.722646153104	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.240001407323	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.215100011935	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.175721109409	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.233280967551	Yes.
0.0	0.534970913881	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.196353380528	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.300787273925	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.242747924825	Right.
0.0	0.369421143939	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.781464966931	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.31983079476	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.203303810682	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.178667506441	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.457577256713	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.46452464994	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.192875880089	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.560605096831	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.291610340988	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.302706266477	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.556774919728	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.605103899281	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.246854423537	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.385860899484	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.412546975028	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.459585769991	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.273084208076	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.317672385959	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.393052222933	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
1.0	0.445457777849	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.175889111443	No -- no...
1.0	0.692916703442	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.946895501571	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.478627025309	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.463525336358	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.764195036326	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.410007556736	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.410349312652	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.357454591911	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.317180888508	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.282019569391	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.242747924825	Right.
0.0	0.177023430033	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.177478345177	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.844501601354	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.2209564257	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.303806819151	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.745384492463	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.645192978998	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.665855210669	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.540488752768	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.367648988355	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.32336103734	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.242747924825	Dynamically.
0.0	0.258918841672	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.239876580309	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.311689266195	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.783345665173	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.629908790321	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.557346152954	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.246033305945	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.316803859727	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.143839089911	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.320141976569	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.272523105093	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.586154822433	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
1.0	0.754980526949	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.261526331725	Creativity.
0.0	0.616991683318	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.366057199407	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.370686328481	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.331333491127	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.656914388402	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.300675884241	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.456911388969	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.228128428178	You're right.
0.0	0.394434923862	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.618020357364	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.280100956489	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.690943898094	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.23408634818	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.30346373275	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.543453766823	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.203033883101	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.519126960626	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.328431798358	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.715706019201	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.509775253056	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.564706226025	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.92054956178	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.221146501532	We're running.
0.0	0.235403977579	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.359309748811	Well, let's go with three.
1.0	0.761417951028	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.409024746563	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.494602814183	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.178181579399	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.606812857196	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
1.0	0.64435778896	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.628619376708	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.38014408185	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
1.0	0.265800054434	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
1.0	0.229288255702	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.545817298161	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.348482332738	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.682925351803	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.749097490461	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.671232761116	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.40324546053	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.362510022657	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.191142366987	...No, sir...
0.0	0.22420521527	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.688497140944	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.67383887232	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.366862048264	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.40468477099	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.93875697317	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.621272490434	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.407460209083	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.238371373456	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.453586798513	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.356553902084	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.661960666657	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.317581227201	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.862219886793	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.450940518253	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.294089894613	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.235031447578	Why?
0.0	0.237394869716	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.760798658898	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.808299447346	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.232409133302	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.80704119191	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
1.0	0.381611519083	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.182632860536	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.272941631702	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.51611609986	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.32738195447	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.245283169166	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.397242856025	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.318286405368	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.38180627917	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.72447212899	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.20561695868	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.254688966034	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.302580396061	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.812427262434	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.457921094401	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.607743121277	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.554311824473	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.592352626387	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.436171304878	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.353277184686	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.404459440405	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.340066059778	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.21949864124	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.621961495697	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.225580308252	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.867341085093	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.475774832858	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.256289871861	We were wrong.
0.0	0.402798565485	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.266998687132	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.687182206137	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.222736246426	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.216669620772	Thank you.
0.0	0.562074453612	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.448953694297	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.380536008957	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.607134535366	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.738862963861	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.593783946846	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.181012861779	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.409230185999	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.226256185154	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.961787922535	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.187950551615	What should we do?
0.0	0.164597293423	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.685517109924	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.198880311774	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.216669620772	Thank you.
0.0	0.540672596667	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.16663083842	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.343105581846	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.261360656201	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.342924607926	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.35867567132	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.214420988776	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.374296550756	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.5	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.240786291143	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.200509018736	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.250366338714	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.64643427402	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.149737916655	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.453351796538	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.913589849647	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.523511900255	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.62922469319	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.423385119867	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.335107325044	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.600651393972	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.344655332552	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.873353733939	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.337736136821	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.256892969149	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.555171215141	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.54602441874	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.322688001658	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.266258756562	No vision at all.
0.0	0.304801326582	Just for the record.
0.0	0.200736779684	That is not right.
0.0	0.167963899858	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.130249836302	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.234844604844	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.465881548281	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.554320528102	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.26760173642	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.285351456132	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.223701401685	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.598116447485	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.278771837551	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.105914426446	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.275650166169	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.724931694317	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.249306856579	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.810065251619	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.216669620772	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.415310550486	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.710161006595	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.256865010721	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.487254906543	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.406350605321	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.247138026029	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.382919127925	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.317805415231	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.64564012458	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.643096133154	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.311644224603	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.491727159181	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.760538756158	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.478088841649	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.250092078233	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.229123361582	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.529885510724	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.216669620772	Thank you.
0.0	0.635420405328	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.828682376891	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.5	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.284524108239	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.5	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.159034822658	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.297424520326	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.217272002818	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.167780269188	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.534071384575	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.212490753118	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.561962410497	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.344031255685	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.342690357806	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.318348108868	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.842576210214	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.401580109454	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.635095140747	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.395867819963	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.300661252109	Our vets are being treated horribly.
1.0	0.799772137716	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.216669620772	Thank you.
0.0	0.29729213514	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.367612388138	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.478958819155	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.682005820539	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.639593647688	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.62423288293	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.239813086418	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.638028829502	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.785159520762	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
1.0	0.705545948177	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.549483121448	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.27501066047	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.206343771789	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.296920818602	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.387626902385	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.43816358717	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.760537815028	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.611168440278	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.229001326281	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.176467688757	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.64609751319	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.605380414296	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.257832323893	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.291478307444	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.725004791367	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.222002059653	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.148168682	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.273114187574	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.5	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
1.0	0.63138238334	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.449115666931	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.368413298504	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.235380250109	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.180256383358	...Rand is exactly right.
1.0	0.702444546821	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.310223291396	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.298462096431	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.376576706519	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.826969764083	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.150097730847	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.438823713155	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.270063503298	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.334843721472	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.250753205519	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.52595248245	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.269976879265	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.246421291815	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.276493382463	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.26852452937	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.358191306116	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.35817419523	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.709220642648	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.30520450271	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.42896337589	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
1.0	0.251245915206	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.378894831424	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.430593656655	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.329649698757	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.869265133149	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.452371574717	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.736166874136	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.461824488005	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.242747924825	Absolutely.
0.0	0.686361107307	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.171226318135	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.393482710808	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.186792840197	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.385949055067	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.287963728847	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.221699297951	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.695697961755	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.591998663064	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.80263463237	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.58332746566	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.405311432097	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.39026415493	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.289253859436	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.235708572945	You looking at me?
0.0	0.17168185422	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.309761850345	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.697945501899	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.481781880811	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.279270629625	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.23337904121	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.284486753247	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.309473710433	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.788874241884	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.52413303678	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.362586319839	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.390250660854	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.684050177216	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.301791889164	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.490182650783	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.436033492434	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.210063335315	That's my view.
0.0	0.225622085447	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.660851551746	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.20603246969	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.19399509636	And you know what?
1.0	0.5	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
1.0	0.741748126793	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.287824337135	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.244501369947	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.409661565677	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.754240314517	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.187133098909	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.118709299281	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.247735470603	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.300512880707	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.855271254765	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.250273027796	About Medicare?
0.0	0.708592286991	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.391047861402	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.201303624623	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.273344382063	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.687690146136	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.291268518392	You did.
0.0	0.78324353876	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.

0.0	0.184447550769	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.288567975221	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.882129657953	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.309771333324	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.437735861168	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.309766080139	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.234171011927	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.198925422685	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.515470214253	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.604333571166	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.281723507327	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.228329754916	It's not working.
0.0	0.212096832273	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.440252208559	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.264094091167	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.278363033751	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.348157944909	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.745309403637	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.340556988047	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.178383724127	I don't like that.
0.0	0.528444612522	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.453225194508	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.319843560686	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.819995314985	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.225703485087	That's the difference.
0.0	0.592965094219	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
1.0	0.552147835469	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.651231046965	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.61655576084	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.616509298915	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.49125759672	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.646668663043	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.365924754466	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.218402252296	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.461186108555	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.224385991574	That's right.
0.0	0.328193087341	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.422526554492	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.20985246241	So you might not.
1.0	0.5	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.229001326281	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.580212228	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.518377389691	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.320752338489	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.554050845225	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.239061470391	That's my bill.
0.0	0.313665140459	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.530197664097	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.301583958996	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.473602215733	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.5	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.229836392	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.226536564248	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.341539306904	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.36281840288	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.22619092479	We have to do something.
0.0	0.267407693248	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.173961086566	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.436641641627	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.25493648677	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.228954828917	You have to lead.
0.0	0.317237169864	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.680665192227	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.447074993407	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.620636012229	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.419930562605	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.253414462016	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.5341836349	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.402994435839	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.218823128657	Maria...
0.0	0.179702371534	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.592150485284	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.5	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.662482431838	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.259719576351	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.56184118317	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
1.0	0.857360264714	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.461168348081	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.416770544086	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.680350522005	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.178240239523	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.549920615605	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.823424814558	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.27252431458	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.339461268913	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.519344992273	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.212257745002	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.180430597818	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.460613710036	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.209440603782	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.322892090828	I never said that.
0.0	0.833681036248	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.208010878934	You don't have to.
0.0	0.277822486747	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.163803921643	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.528354894335	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.174584491366	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.0905178936484	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.784985081267	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.148203927066	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.613716243117	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.581888273846	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.273523960872	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.599171684537	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.767166880639	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.658505709738	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.361545417921	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.223549842796	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.272687684147	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.244066068286	John?
0.0	0.705869551126	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.197918712003	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.550405944222	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.69335146577	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.298101422435	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.455345384388	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.55715101728	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.285897663091	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.650939499786	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.215848031695	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.273924795928	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.7075347941	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.46509934299	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.252948978837	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.5	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.363478359869	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.254661354035	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.260964152445	They're off to China.
0.0	0.447819892639	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.153153972384	I mean, you know...
1.0	0.263431923239	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.539382556126	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.168060081159	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.545906852528	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.574687108519	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.396247732645	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.346568912565	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.387115647077	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.274404172775	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.5	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.818590704177	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.663781974787	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.403722484768	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.811243321969	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.181028167101	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.386895792798	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.622426087067	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.334735511518	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.649767564759	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.366917298738	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.315840795693	I was the architect.
0.0	0.375724897279	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.242747924825	Right.
0.0	0.903079325893	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.366240945333	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.256089055201	On welfare.
0.0	0.680825761	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.219090410735	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.256810978045	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.320379670946	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.200015434053	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.401756955455	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.289749944612	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.276534766615	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.34284366172	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.447239488862	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.188222408139	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.228128428178	We haven't.
0.0	0.315386131915	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.33966065229	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.193202684666	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.34221401875	He hit oil.
0.0	0.646854485398	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.738810095208	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.264908998985	They get them on the black market.
1.0	0.252574728478	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.389268815293	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.216254209512	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.5	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.62389510938	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.749303094628	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.561041976717	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.283846498385	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.627038808445	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.949991743587	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.386714489385	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.233280967551	OK?
0.0	0.343004120885	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.454420913694	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.227219033534	No.
0.0	0.427151533417	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.302829632436	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.629792182574	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
1.0	0.581036785994	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.427210252365	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.313943581	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.410579273547	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.417186500559	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.263834492686	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.490552113909	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.670299461099	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.523055373075	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.656668959746	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.328944232982	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.196036272129	I agree with them.
1.0	0.447064366108	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.216669620772	Thank you.
0.0	0.297863532547	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.371919723938	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.481347196218	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.217077124026	It is.
0.0	0.241256220782	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.277458640296	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.388307136599	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.222039807294	Why is that?
0.0	0.458387609831	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
1.0	0.73784387345	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.847829442415	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.362116060877	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.715642161876	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.247934741146	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.306167535157	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
1.0	0.598434321724	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.188355453573	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.188412808217	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.21184158918	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.302256252418	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.170231178396	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.668186678777	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.244066068286	John.
0.0	0.22110746286	Wait for what?
0.0	0.214133899121	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.242696015958	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.46320236123	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.197414980198	That is important.
0.0	0.186422594847	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.305944998168	She was right.
0.0	0.41506090242	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.5	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.290799252146	What have you got now?
0.0	0.468137668925	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.672158830028	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.243024664806	Big difference.
0.0	0.241505162531	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.263792182306	White people?
0.0	0.539686071268	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.635745594737	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.236803765081	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.252155445523	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.388772397977	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.304709722013	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.210473019373	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.359377791631	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.667229312317	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.492353212169	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.447184461669	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.234983401717	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.450887200854	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.5	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
1.0	0.414546069705	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.200872065462	That's what he is.
0.0	0.765881511492	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.757970698725	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.677139325307	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.494502580903	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.809254068536	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.394684668337	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.207844911965	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.735420466189	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.375503234594	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.296517337228	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.5	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.302396777591	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.137888778867	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.229075417212	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.393766372447	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.845152761761	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.2889080927	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.587689145509	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.397792261336	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.225562292898	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.13535007643	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.83907894901	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.538113066802	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.248628936674	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.180707228566	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.265260575401	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.671489448351	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.172758817066	I think you're --
0.0	0.223178788675	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.734054862286	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.133239826422	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.357564958082	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.492417350575	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.337387782337	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.23477131724	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.332899165241	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.250017840362	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.44149834036	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.250049598017	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.577746052268	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.36075731752	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.392155347485	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.254886303671	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.334318098811	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.5	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.248739732759	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.258711512594	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.267109491245	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.187250735829	I would change them.
0.0	0.623248062337	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.340832406166	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.514626700704	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.784449100151	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.431672360092	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.375170189055	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.537780929318	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.570615230878	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.662530002106	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.548942333319	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.925860566471	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.217783023206	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.241487373196	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.22744680033	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.523150319804	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.775748001944	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.341546692966	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.5	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.56143384756	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.205644716886	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.38824255324	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.251593012555	A brief response.
0.0	0.265730702071	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.844607666604	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.208224079038	I want security.
0.0	0.541551131031	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.346091381244	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.467299513792	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.29993151346	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.335402123947	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.31774065101	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.777260721074	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.121803943362	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.262315795569	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.242747924825	Ever.
0.0	0.220385053887	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.335241628384	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.747177947538	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.333060487833	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.51583165739	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.347019924111	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.841834206652	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.850503543484	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.59034049754	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.159321989423	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.476518437497	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.455944226384	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.275294679131	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.526996347075	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.861720242699	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.506908131813	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.851262884165	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.510810407986	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.316258309126	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.389653658314	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.358931856359	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.234956088233	You're simply not.
0.0	0.218823128657	Becky --
1.0	0.658516696714	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.397667058488	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.195137076775	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.343790582763	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.18013491028	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.378385203297	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.542063601093	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.800272250156	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.307591187581	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.112769596992	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.473658815817	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.269782262766	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.290127346942	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.335682082377	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.241790883917	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.510037682875	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.469937074211	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.788445774564	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.246848320265	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.507933759196	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.724734062181	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.427053201699	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.219607014905	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.518409390767	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.272093025282	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.514857519123	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.645287137586	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.535423096119	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.408856368124	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.233280967551	OK.
0.0	0.19399509636	But you know what?
0.0	0.230725271067	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.15904797093	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.572056904648	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.738157092769	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.260660656207	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.237946425501	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.201587995428	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.176249839272	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.169253567628	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.356179278585	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.245402004762	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.272148908839	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.554579589576	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.183668360217	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.674308932889	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.221789112841	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.266848702469	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.285993566635	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.658040415443	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.654641968853	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.751814360075	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.328056390014	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.772063302003	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
1.0	0.843337351392	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.194442576942	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.216752957585	I can't do it.
0.0	0.222565581551	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.490978239345	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.636969164352	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
1.0	0.798298952184	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.275264789046	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.230415263	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.798209930376	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.223940478441	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.557665289008	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.242583011835	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.51657989912	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.186502363359	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.219577644417	Think about it.
0.0	0.181547628657	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.411829658145	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.520753305259	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.274499376695	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.166227795662	No, it's true.
0.0	0.660697915081	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.200154183549	You're welcome.
0.0	0.73992267047	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.440366324921	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.38179391865	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.233297865611	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.879370642581	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.807912826727	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.205198923823	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.25344745219	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.680394744313	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.818702060504	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.490346165143	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.779811389535	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.401229763994	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.626864882966	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.233280967551	Yeah.
0.0	0.143613412627	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.726898100993	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.424264949843	We had Boko Haram.
1.0	0.729882576899	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.218224169058	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.216669620772	Thank you.
0.0	0.617403341525	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.291920940404	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.322341130818	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.301907024169	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.436678251032	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.519282513796	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.228432503188	Check it out.
0.0	0.341427096029	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.349545564534	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.255316770102	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.208559723635	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.560815238567	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.19882781442	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.25654975284	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.358300613969	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.211129403904	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.187908258496	...before I go.
0.0	0.404434990068	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.131764396753	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.706792315076	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.219577644417	Think about it.
0.0	0.632213497405	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.527555652675	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.477374969812	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
1.0	0.865313500106	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.276891013789	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.476860906602	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.275728861679	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.511529278503	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.60523768756	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.232663365482	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.44775962734	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.937495981189	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.392723043498	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.319011462305	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.334574440996	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.198784054189	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.210559988564	You know that.
0.0	0.538548888817	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.841040234188	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.196209979015	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.308856305845	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.570470273006	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.265524940335	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.223351803035	You do.
0.0	0.84376175463	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.343484550186	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.856425589748	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.735194137715	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.282508372011	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.186964260126	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.396847205025	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.807132691706	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.253321932784	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
1.0	0.464523700418	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
1.0	0.195185906575	That's wrong.
0.0	0.43813476273	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.390277336431	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.311147519981	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.423100404001	Two points.
0.0	0.903908431799	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.322882515429	You know why three?
0.0	0.354588755804	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.227125278042	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.239879443374	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.23990201222	This country is changing.
0.0	0.26169292368	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.284990622977	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.605420316161	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.265764326005	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.225876534247	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.633792833126	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.653630586034	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.752576603369	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.318666663333	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.339214596423	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.174495933417	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.6997703322	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.505982260373	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.451184416119	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.674511457344	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.612889269142	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.205956250676	You bet they do.
0.0	0.265822292719	They were wrong.
0.0	0.350151810749	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.539247810025	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.669629607157	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.68249155903	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.483999431382	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.35296493797	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.412581193505	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.709270233925	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.912247465359	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.406130803193	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.286973854281	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.487348737171	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.5	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.169855717307	You just want to...
0.0	0.228128428178	You're right.
0.0	0.838345206634	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.237727296457	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.576849031353	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.462757461839	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.226702938186	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.361099349916	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.390702008799	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.714950627477	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.254079661438	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.792971647574	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.780424250216	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.345074071496	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.798633381463	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.347096672773	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.370026565484	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.344021294854	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.227219033534	No.
0.0	0.245305785695	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.211339675681	You know why?
0.0	0.57843510055	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.222709906426	It goes away.
0.0	0.235544855792	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.465104548177	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.22941655193	I've laid out...
0.0	0.210410206824	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
1.0	0.256451862193	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.40420398573	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.643657772797	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.453956023585	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.345372147369	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.433233043543	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.281904067534	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.246004283229	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
1.0	0.575314722263	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.320090223119	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
