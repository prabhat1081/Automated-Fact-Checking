0.0	0.409862674415	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.246869782254	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.35053670812	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.523792124077	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.513041323042	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.354717983917	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.244075188143	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.510897150581	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.300824872613	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.269746016196	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.309644786666	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.418059847095	That's right.
0.0	0.591687256793	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.393905227623	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.257603785027	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.428444372461	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.515454172636	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.422656984827	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.418280735029	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.430639841388	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.511179452997	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.250055325077	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.418911045517	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
1.0	0.620083643733	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.185565103785	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.5814307126	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.536538769229	They're a scam.
0.0	0.399338381181	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.610435321112	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.634821117609	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.379256916129	You know that.
0.0	0.219986485134	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.421315868707	Good at email.
0.0	0.279511867048	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.794420544353	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.466173030448	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.557379204899	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.415500645365	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.456826774867	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.272379282226	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.347509286597	Here's the thing.
1.0	0.403963014321	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.825774260287	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
1.0	0.201662755172	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.267987824147	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.430562224794	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.413349598611	I never said that.
0.0	0.467972927694	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.563762175753	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.411620565903	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.373948059425	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.513443033145	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.301190416889	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.482449049169	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.187053956197	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.295836912365	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.397157116691	No, you did.
0.0	0.250240226934	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.278999741015	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.351719669998	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.300986790286	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.5	I said no.
0.0	0.451779426395	You target the bad guys.
1.0	0.56593666716	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.28644992797	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.336956600168	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.428919452109	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.644834237596	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.794729906805	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.508056560537	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.378353238617	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.393644789967	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.469687526548	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.86021485685	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.169217948121	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.572738367279	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.471043911288	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.477363983505	I'm tested.
0.0	0.261848306083	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.454329866209	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.416013719365	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.455020149536	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.218307877467	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.137799377863	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.294925828947	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.39203320523	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.485792034088	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.50742202323	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.378235235665	I love this country.
0.0	0.351157956599	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.515484885821	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.306953062228	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.483489441149	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.306965305006	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.809742853525	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.675969798828	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.305572184913	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.392936633326	Right.
0.0	0.378476154756	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.308819965285	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.689015021428	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.478515510452	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.428254069774	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.543095704048	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.33557940342	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.317809165434	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.274225913313	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.0943759593113	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.317703684921	Wait for what?
0.0	0.451179940545	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.205997700599	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.506464053836	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.436130087831	It was.
0.0	0.345735709854	You know why?
0.0	0.838536682231	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.303956129773	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.460597863308	We are lowering taxes on small business.
1.0	0.9806422238	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.550374304944	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.458845836239	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.378701504509	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.5	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.3450178408	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.41319745692	That is not right.
0.0	0.527922987917	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.175671888997	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.291520172179	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.440231586425	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.535028302663	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.698253521292	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.618772647301	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.318240292177	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.27755389	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.247210505105	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.407795942384	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.55097781885	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.451516439809	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.316917149799	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.318167891892	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.331583389118	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.586012818943	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.348438717817	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.663063142583	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.302059416841	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.376148847269	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.364373849878	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.5	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.340184192004	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.541450351989	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.430430729121	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.519235557194	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.420416009866	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.700311469587	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
1.0	0.622199282309	It looked like very few women.
1.0	0.752079416688	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.492845224711	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.383953928836	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.45234668153	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.542374101494	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.391050797791	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.291246827861	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.471096422909	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.344870647031	We need sound money.
0.0	0.30945950866	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.5	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.61599739365	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.335545466741	So you might not.
0.0	0.364193769966	She said the truth.
0.0	0.580454847043	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.64962184489	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.561770111143	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.447507516533	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.414213924388	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.422997852932	You get together.
0.0	0.21720224423	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
1.0	0.459852285484	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.432815048384	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.221676104301	The number of women --
0.0	0.424639065324	You know, that's so simple.
1.0	0.530573325517	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.652813586756	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.458838194923	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.403381603569	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.461307893208	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.171811134928	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.515702506889	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.339467405904	I promise.
0.0	0.710516214451	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.359655076419	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
1.0	0.677975676416	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.291525856521	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.462812234927	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.349906476687	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.369486936482	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.656686293821	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.505854121553	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.428436377333	It goes away.

0.0	0.565014318152	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.569425386999	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.213524235841	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.439398525018	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.

0.0	0.486307498122	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.117385194396	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.469644343471	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.349576822195	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.361132030107	I have no illusion.

0.0	0.303087292981	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.46143380786	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.294501956997	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.55942393356	You do legislation.
0.0	0.5	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.352050440286	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.539806113879	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.3166695908	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.320431720942	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.

0.0	0.821821099336	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.519400993196	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?

0.0	0.417701762815	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.217022761852	That's my view.
0.0	0.645748776975	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.337086587568	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.479689640249	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.663649795676	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.248544383	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.611826239877	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.432567190563	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.437257963535	My background is different.
0.0	0.719502264225	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.305115655177	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.200711272844	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
1.0	0.483701085667	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.388773023053	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.259380139394	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.571528130738	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.451721755114	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.544981609511	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.440135899276	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.398311729331	And he was a managing general partner.
1.0	0.486427471362	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.458410384823	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.405146670552	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
1.0	0.732894389057	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.319617564741	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.221793242912	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.484535887432	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.25350326771	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.64540307375	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.442451951331	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.345596519529	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.

0.0	0.355248747324	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.257608312847	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.

0.0	0.299471141441	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.559141886456	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.155258875282	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.

0.0	0.365414924603	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.589865484042	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.538867775135	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.333775418427	I can do that.
0.0	0.312351620905	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.357463215968	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.719082277142	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.492895793329	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.43286458056	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.532515557022	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.696521434272	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.215918721074	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.363548586178	That's good.
0.0	0.402338845442	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.42710643847	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.493974806199	They're protectionist.
1.0	0.652802180277	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.440784676056	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.382358917572	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.368950630151	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.533551886241	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.345863603078	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.339691073881	My point is this.
0.0	0.565508281331	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.451847055794	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.359120040878	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.614459388114	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.331978749879	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.276613358053	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.418562001376	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.375897014523	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.47137908523	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.250935305571	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.596217349625	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.445734215367	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.339903853726	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.227009153049	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.335119967481	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.252712154782	But...
0.0	0.468808378175	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.262794272823	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.387774285208	You do.
0.0	0.705627587496	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.442130939151	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.509738154373	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.372426383162	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.378786634162	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.322940171616	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.243741187226	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.404257519492	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.40423385972	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.155349948881	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.336456900377	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.457649046502	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.321736518604	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.226636771535	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.451772045836	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.51831843826	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.559217027619	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.677676134519	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.545082530183	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.217993557817	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.417653272097	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.217321499785	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.514064008283	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.409859525707	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.546127224302	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.403244632663	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.34912059694	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.332668523572	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.559653687709	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.520817715919	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.386576041787	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.492609650646	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.709758854287	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.600873565658	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.246504561382	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.589137049884	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.568596419598	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.413349598611	I never said that.
0.0	0.720788993311	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.485421366057	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.212545096075	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.481959786318	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.666747511494	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.40478665988	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.563908874738	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.403122612721	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.506236144107	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.418135107711	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.488708588623	You've got to give people hope.
1.0	0.628563016565	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.353068148325	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.659483722814	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.243774035393	It's true.
0.0	0.457033536918	We both have a lot of small donors.
1.0	0.543785713967	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.429296428979	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.539058081418	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.355342697362	Illegal.
0.0	0.250989912736	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.368666576285	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.352774920846	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.33844960824	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.331875418536	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.352871750851	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.285014344278	What should we do?
0.0	0.368471879496	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.181225862364	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.339784501735	...Thank you.
0.0	0.224357326195	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.625226129102	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.442848312539	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.15197680877	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.333779938373	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.524372210236	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.394645182424	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.45380240181	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.141548675047	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.329962894815	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.528038097916	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.206248432328	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.601012296427	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.246888473523	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.452725297047	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.549165800877	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.435536466405	I know every one.
0.0	0.395906631979	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.341150927304	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.234653722944	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.406948042657	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.30860996627	...John...
0.0	0.586358552753	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.446418710254	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.630203920891	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.631518953825	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.391607511672	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.270077959904	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.25588916407	This country is changing.
0.0	0.594593574176	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.481355489175	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
1.0	0.45778811609	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.340794832319	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.4067239819	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.427961055262	That is important.
0.0	0.150886781006	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.219219634403	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.694400937201	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.223199638446	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.398628887151	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.

0.0	0.421965691047	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.329531669334	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.178563054267	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.

0.0	0.436130087831	You did.
0.0	0.239960864927	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.

0.0	0.418241710446	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.339903853726	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.792854229939	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.376708441382	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.249205275574	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.354965631039	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.468925655012	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.543481353651	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.259505387768	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.689317567371	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.401835931911	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.346447185507	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.397348810533	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.0644372833466	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.390162618838	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.418076528586	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.359826253462	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.331356709492	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.393528726502	Creativity.
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.21279086994	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.256887578144	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
1.0	0.879150969848	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.671231826664	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.287760095015	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.663425816169	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.402097230057	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.160140708071	...No, sir...
0.0	0.204194496743	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.142274939035	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.370562128702	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.333414914575	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.248380679115	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.422114423154	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.612951146928	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.166406212548	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.380181117305	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.432881085518	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.26023994192	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.265576191168	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.634051690855	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.817940566976	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.290068383031	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.636112174553	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.330904370346	No, no.
0.0	0.411609064219	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.508327060618	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.457085858046	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.368791220995	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.395663112923	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.385590151055	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.528393602892	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.585389135496	And you know what?
0.0	0.779989636895	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.488750751065	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.683932688102	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.277288378291	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.387018490379	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.407394582633	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.267282431386	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.323316789528	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.299290874666	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.427115757237	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.5	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.313448535445	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.487565548214	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.476469167216	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.0555009741366	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.437502705731	slot.
0.0	0.5	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.267734288767	...
0.0	0.485314541534	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.161909399486	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.298748191529	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.258397962221	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.231803293317	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.438949306296	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.598932361694	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.5	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.257422958221	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.358654073504	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.396572138364	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.198495317225	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.492362819306	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.440094046516	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.301564675511	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.578184000549	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.327537764826	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.277584531306	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.372755947253	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.48916637417	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.405393561738	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.387653743523	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.147352329665	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.548855344778	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.392936633326	Right.
0.0	0.315206778254	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.434451701357	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.219497529527	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.285784979138	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.170793846817	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
1.0	0.288517709378	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.629707424693	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.426973465243	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.285005931611	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.459329437379	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.311785839935	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.779893781361	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.29702937666	John, I'd like to address this?
1.0	0.170673019539	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.5	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.705943149584	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.628315645053	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.355362123911	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.157482869114	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.184635161587	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.294982689252	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.666464394465	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.323629707649	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
1.0	0.0861900430471	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.241264034898	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.347930212237	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.571170225123	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.632663150067	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.

0.0	0.5	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.246738846206	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.46180784171	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.359654658407	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.

0.0	0.524045818731	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.26486102238	But look...
1.0	0.236758182294	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.564953239261	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.318224514765	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.179177316247	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.461891575936	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.389805907157	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.13748933302	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.46285570028	(inaudible).
0.0	0.64818081508	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.566982185984	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.282489518986	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.713524699225	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.631208676577	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.18527962406	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.246031840965	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.0651422685451	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.121854218378	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.539258732045	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.449017863614	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.340008588761	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.684765720309	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.477796839622	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.193693957783	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.546823967847	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.340522487258	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.47223577398	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.547160568719	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.317091449683	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.233438883656	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.252712154782	And...
0.0	0.545035528033	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.592163887211	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.5	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.316569960965	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.537891894903	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.344799265237	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.310388599072	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.573753288422	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.164954986058	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.316409312886	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.944147215429	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.275875728389	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.338214602301	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.460017553685	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.484511187707	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.315247079412	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.393730729137	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.206146124271	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.632986718632	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.635540646991	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.210422399918	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.256611911358	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.536343110822	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.382091128811	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.481060242716	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.600878472647	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.304784873622	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.335427968994	That is...
0.0	0.287112000546	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.209197047431	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.332203482806	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.432456460833	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.279450708144	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.466095420381	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.694215492115	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.419267903304	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.358469461463	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.288839269992	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.213308548668	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.250438765627	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.375628155401	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.5	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.370402363793	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.238160951112	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.318058646197	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.249232841259	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.417589167232	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.331747234551	Big difference.
0.0	0.199566181624	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.132603196607	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.5	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
1.0	0.416313788009	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.312132830465	OK?
0.0	0.457192271334	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.25453743927	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.567696605146	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.195240598273	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.246747642188	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.386823367262	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.314232644814	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.477421154334	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.715318815259	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.309680063521	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.236578098979	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.112708831065	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.528422284843	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.249639587327	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.355462052062	...before I go.
0.0	0.32328555649	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.530404511573	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.300130291236	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.51046583813	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.406180963954	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.363288251578	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.457908072352	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.343538150712	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.545010689165	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.282820808183	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.531355497972	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.747381105732	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.241707510259	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.185383574654	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.276117005673	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.297485983413	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.510575310378	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.5	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.332556338671	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.380616906862	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.687137460903	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.269820854852	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.261579722025	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.280955134605	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.467383595761	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.391954129866	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.649037701509	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.425553319	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.813264589015	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.48021671038	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.422162767773	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.63001182442	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.571164216005	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.363249142671	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.273366366845	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.398509843551	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.279126015033	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.396620671511	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.480565417267	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.438395725576	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.54855258828	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.27180041012	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.507788656018	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.272652466454	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.229865507367	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.254840352825	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.341707356736	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.515674756372	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.517306971986	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.362291466748	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.30843764457	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.400171774532	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.373637229852	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.745911513012	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.733961170086	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.249781540689	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.392936633326	Right.
0.0	0.564185134651	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.443805525201	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.299211747541	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.749131205432	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.516970031062	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.404193349855	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.467682320165	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.561398985858	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
1.0	0.533102885677	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.381694851678	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
1.0	0.758125739804	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.634590776438	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.350893271709	How about this?
0.0	0.45135749031	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.598063284706	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.603090464843	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.430774274153	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.427937328646	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.433338834438	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.349886917863	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.404053846305	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.27738898843	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.187590788573	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.298577732914	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.403126093046	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.424246391449	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.268836050695	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.249053697362	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.285941937953	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.38910088512	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
1.0	0.327969326143	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.418736648364	You know why three?
0.0	0.258714848487	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.425451367763	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.491541854293	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.239512601833	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.319138024013	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.542352027701	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.236398278536	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.4593968645	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.240320507653	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.559541978412	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.399524572452	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.263415517809	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.328205815816	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.25530392378	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.334066836832	You can have him.
0.0	0.597977521289	She voted for it.
0.0	0.448127646974	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.49214256553	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.186818935991	In all due respect...
0.0	0.290162579277	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.598200364909	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.399716796982	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.114555915959	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.278028441483	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.725238632999	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.904051353584	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.431443414427	I win.
0.0	0.409904738448	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.55088951671	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.476804917059	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.226491637046	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.450622151185	You really can't.
0.0	0.291715796163	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.470979145676	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.144869488762	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
1.0	0.841635896787	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.265256955072	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.464119312338	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.493332654984	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.470237234889	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.419157830274	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.315469308682	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.330117304777	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.445949570837	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.517896234186	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.458914920876	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.941690607097	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.345735241579	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.407504754149	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.464963717077	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.396683118863	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.41319745692	That's not right.
0.0	0.247090729794	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.299992968939	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.585389135496	And you know what?
0.0	0.609427216665	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.387774285208	We do.
0.0	0.340742274132	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.36355388901	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.516882988489	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.347509286597	Here's the thing.
1.0	0.762502642602	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.52758662163	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.592476020325	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.347695835809	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.5	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.435041514643	I've done it.
0.0	0.447359106969	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.296962357159	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.289494871063	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.663232363717	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.5	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.415753798858	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.604718971169	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.447210461296	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.488822084711	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.308028568955	But I would add this.
0.0	0.656799194334	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.218085023087	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.694552505578	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.215033910793	No, it's true.
0.0	0.469669641129	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.434190275475	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.433092274717	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.321655839567	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.163803017108	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.466946964232	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.629577786278	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.484342151129	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.492714689051	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.381001974436	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.235545278275	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.507452346363	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.472414316202	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.156539876514	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.373426280903	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.195953484612	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.654486750973	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.452262259803	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.48232422567	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.583495148389	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.384345258411	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.490485664598	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.369275341206	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.414729075678	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.291295886837	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.586104795255	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.203637180166	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.379181290426	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.300643959116	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.477032615429	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.544443570667	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.526481240379	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.397823397697	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.360826626709	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.0933382664353	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.491377985706	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.387046887784	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.197902301735	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.737816372458	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.431809822251	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.383750976314	I'm looking out for the American worker.
1.0	0.675463906811	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.349041741706	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.45554365478	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.464361420349	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.54539367012	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.336389589495	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.380690372729	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.362161833813	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.423911619327	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.210801832047	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.401474720923	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.368187828191	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.190268507587	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.290447076765	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
1.0	0.706852475203	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.274787983944	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.123734238769	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.345931476883	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.528440489965	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.46364504483	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.155917370278	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.258699850039	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.633309870615	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.209731867549	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.649913203757	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.291831547952	It's a joke.
0.0	0.297473675145	I would change them.
0.0	0.45126937031	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.342436391108	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.418616273199	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.424959044771	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.460255261126	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.594655618844	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
1.0	0.554168183344	I didn't have an involvement with them.
1.0	0.596649852015	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.585327982659	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.135141673321	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.277267248943	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.36940377219	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.585829419746	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.72828174917	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.382186991983	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.564138816588	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.484915797446	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.340712907972	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.4329070762	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.334350053995	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.299272633827	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.480662872229	That's fine.
0.0	0.286987627408	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.192047997792	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.156291836041	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.33264471388	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.386045413194	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.562385043809	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.240913926373	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
1.0	0.785819906241	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.428639792706	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.172377833453	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.44082478912	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.312132830465	Yes.
0.0	0.211752931881	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.260420925987	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.247203653824	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.322274279369	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.569482535983	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.5	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.349275574806	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.0381840107799	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.391311527523	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.409838121845	Not bad.
0.0	0.413951153135	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.5	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.419070228526	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.311315844872	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.217440447286	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.164128180707	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.146888744265	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.390565117862	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.392936633326	Right.
0.0	0.711755381437	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.411793383283	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.437600613877	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.560583754354	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.407513364935	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.329762030084	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.190460662746	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.455244242273	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.367074410723	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.319831629366	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.41035766744	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.294452370566	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.38480000942	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.460618117027	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.659074232908	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.146968361959	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.39533569546	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.117538392121	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.474164819294	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.391241464913	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.181446019016	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.647739733604	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.198610308549	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.370665695063	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.752279824152	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.611737357773	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.365661435228	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.538815476601	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.471641405779	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.316997884259	I like that.
0.0	0.219893925537	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.22912445417	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.280155839341	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.379358275956	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.40167169692	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.348285473736	Think about it.
0.0	0.474850154038	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.392936633326	Dynamically.
0.0	0.370991408117	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.607674163826	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.145139508084	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.130270685947	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.506334812579	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.524260961028	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.5	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.523084905644	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.426908784631	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.530731830202	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.435275568027	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.522719534279	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.381549840472	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.276461039457	He undermines it.
0.0	0.272027079564	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.399026055533	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.747481916601	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.436614888923	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.209619944637	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.253355533738	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.218306314984	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.390423810989	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.24037742266	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.810793898282	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.365167773397	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.481304618101	Both served.
0.0	0.25916489434	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.53358474256	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.506890893554	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.524919625827	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.424017995359	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.439187224591	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.331222605972	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.307650378307	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.286945897749	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.509379273123	You have to lead.
0.0	0.606541266553	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.433541738564	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.477106046374	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.416976041606	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.183671414799	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.273174031271	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.234221543177	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.680810458848	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.25525486973	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.317216704753	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.374334761505	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.740077583835	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.321621038605	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.308598141117	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.523279575683	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.381407762062	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.399746048617	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.25595596316	We're running.
0.0	0.904678748111	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.199241538157	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.393770336913	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.170257897886	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.5	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.387774285208	I have.
0.0	0.473771036995	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.416211578466	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.892520164297	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.295459616936	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.227950727984	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.253704267004	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.381416904289	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.28649086133	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.335683044147	Again...
0.0	0.351191372885	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.367072967252	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.44096423522	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.432249887619	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.415834704865	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.242914328663	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.362032941608	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.597913201158	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.0521383716504	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.63078889014	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.431610228904	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.778857369998	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
1.0	0.946134162468	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.717927763621	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.186671464351	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.292726948387	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.279669059494	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.338198403207	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.358559298292	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.374859497429	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.589957123697	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.46143715718	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.267734288767	...
0.0	0.153496752308	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.253031875989	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.53101765904	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.638208952686	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.493655570994	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.427818438028	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.384775471913	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.453565253015	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.363053836928	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.428763415494	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.22119405121	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.279606839801	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.209445238923	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.414125930775	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.424693012208	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.20609283461	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.340318860712	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.443417494366	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.144273438463	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.338309981058	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.151603246428	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.262576450856	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.762811167916	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.445813083055	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.430608262442	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.306606676784	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.479300234496	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.436466506353	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.415204484931	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.42395906648	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.285883770557	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.346788644018	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.545581789525	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.47984965241	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.361255946279	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.228223105629	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.312132830465	OK.
0.0	0.21509189565	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.233573262294	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.530863347848	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.106350334142	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.544031099745	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.737388789144	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.574458031523	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.271648394045	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.690018263153	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.58496281707	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.38976933671	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.363870550816	They don't like that.
0.0	0.629833037741	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.36627838488	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.927622917228	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.39732201856	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.328847470275	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.185851476832	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.266985374386	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.216132387015	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.383558076578	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.596262879922	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.399640515434	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.321663879388	Divide that out.
0.0	0.182319658756	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.529076709702	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.426939050177	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.58549733485	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.158923847063	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.492108027086	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.334083849571	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.520829396053	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.456406218185	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.304992168384	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.118878040214	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.445749691999	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.556181588905	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.322752375084	I will not do that.
0.0	0.390949136414	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.232083118613	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.460468966337	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.4592365052	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.452463071718	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.491476797211	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.553615621575	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.588906855111	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.312532840906	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.258300939556	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.615616325502	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.479162206266	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.428297776706	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.39244557142	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.652784768408	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.472501091674	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.432266483756	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.422633084031	What have you got now?
0.0	0.47511863591	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.452712322813	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.482821458965	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.309058923279	That will change everything.
0.0	0.365871336167	No.
0.0	0.253365915051	You bet they do.
0.0	0.142274939035	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.253937706202	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.279333851596	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.414954203723	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.401242508928	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.441676025304	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.465768405112	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.337849882458	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.633844563893	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.342658284522	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.312132830465	Yeah.
0.0	0.269681247608	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.36956092209	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.595529519426	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.301407448598	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.644555629162	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.333788986412	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.856314455105	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.515154499418	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.553888978537	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.653698514538	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.205645560615	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.476805929027	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.258975417251	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.437137452049	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.649080268811	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.34166660796	Our next president...
0.0	0.419357606986	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.226203396487	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.384861812721	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.423336556795	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.644928043724	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.414262412426	White people?
0.0	0.302697511826	OK, good.
0.0	0.364295649674	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.480486341592	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.434366899588	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.47734798466	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.450806240303	We actually did it.
0.0	0.284724156951	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.646357457128	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.546249409502	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.441394129278	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.354348375488	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.268846688519	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.394717275892	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.372657184075	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.426093682328	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.246015377321	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.450268912412	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.650464736122	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.465202452012	We had Hamas.
1.0	0.453560796123	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.440992695214	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.113609931314	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.444608045739	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.260094380015	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.681341953	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.215537148278	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.306526805992	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.225139436441	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.344931319376	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.689426332602	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.301987684881	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.32204917517	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.396133761295	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.337069223792	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.598157882236	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.479957050503	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.556532996656	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
1.0	0.620384636982	Very few children.
0.0	0.401232521064	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.160916741797	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.386229198191	They're off to China.
0.0	0.663372759416	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.874213221733	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.451360482964	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.534964391606	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.390492127024	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.394755111968	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.339841396797	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.16035641957	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.363917608786	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.34730703181	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.41319745692	That's not right.
0.0	0.225462414174	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.346623929811	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.352296869959	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.312132830465	Yes.
0.0	0.706557562107	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.189850964189	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.650741065273	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.368557844816	I think he is right.
0.0	0.639961228841	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.273788666915	I think you're --
0.0	0.209991145404	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.411590992578	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.580456070572	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.726773146577	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.163029023105	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.474167574525	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.900594575487	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.727656424894	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.253332415801	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.409154116476	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.265645954348	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.438437655104	I understand.
0.0	0.41575967275	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.215817171685	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.286613057739	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.179278780491	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.30229170124	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.319361843889	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.39752538633	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.593468484369	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.369913688758	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.452225696139	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.369750554221	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.199266825706	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.430321252092	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.63671271992	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.420588722003	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.581302626886	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.394803927524	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.480571389689	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.60967725596	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.556133564784	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.698732792653	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.257848033353	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.444458781458	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.420655276783	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.0705162839657	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.211509863894	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.371086185127	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.628372642584	So you know what?
0.0	0.313761502428	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.155974154089	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.381834217559	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
1.0	0.5	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.362879349251	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.25948898042	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.542793698274	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.766151127614	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.29461313001	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.269777599857	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.306613181527	These...
0.0	0.334687274482	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.256790215445	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.346765201629	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.105385213728	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.653752547455	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.771487204955	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.533722736968	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.474576343982	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.293956546856	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.280283470077	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.506218786612	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.209531563982	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.468404961901	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.482506997482	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.168602121847	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.29046172925	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.631044373043	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.48759336603	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.471761763822	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.448555568857	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
1.0	0.539373464335	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.272766827235	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.36914224914	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
1.0	0.276510150178	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.402879239076	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.345704372606	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.284266806399	I don't care.
0.0	0.625011075332	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.658792311859	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.0805573519728	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.22699304286	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.548960853719	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.351877413114	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.382947925665	Say again?
0.0	0.208754604761	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.329606477371	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.297361925579	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.361977962307	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.53603271363	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.574775035086	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.229033047056	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.332482188426	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.572722822681	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.52746794823	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.339225886254	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.227639871741	I would just say that...
0.0	0.410263694161	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
1.0	0.389613057407	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.55926156207	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.570076612275	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.619678733173	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.453385651818	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
1.0	0.362600055685	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.346717546216	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.783570737373	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.456012733253	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.452030328253	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.437758960735	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.815544915899	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.178750709861	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.571319356296	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.355424907308	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.464719219875	I will show you what they do to women.
1.0	0.601076597477	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.55479815219	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.581414582784	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.648170419285	Of course not.
0.0	0.140865402245	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.505232164385	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.183625761684	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.284112550406	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.915443417349	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.462747618373	I changed that.
0.0	0.533084869768	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.315340545139	The answer is no.
0.0	0.662733503988	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.440755050275	I can't do it.
0.0	0.464119247679	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.254062143143	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.695098837617	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.843317631904	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.361064494218	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.382877672967	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.525782884749	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.229234358698	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
1.0	0.578261424242	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.592487007973	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.5	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.535969219117	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.369360889916	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.39762097586	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.482793523876	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.699472569112	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.356634135932	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.71716654475	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.394867812915	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.487630396583	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.200843071211	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.462868713736	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.194242874076	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.131689035944	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.211710804909	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.171766524687	-- the governor's absolutely right.
1.0	0.514018025685	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.237523964817	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.455915393774	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.453963011216	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.305515980675	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.414264129681	It's their money.
0.0	0.48075737664	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.250426370896	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.400753260877	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.626689908655	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.409524727401	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.427665948741	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.46810559729	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.183491198551	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.506323683551	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.425759679906	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
1.0	0.374283975962	That's wrong.
0.0	0.379976561886	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.35663731433	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.204428387885	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.426536067018	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.382936755028	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.0680811819332	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.368881582226	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.5	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
1.0	0.454905363527	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
1.0	0.458995723932	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.267734288767	...
0.0	0.460305027653	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.657329425297	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.226421181853	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.781748481444	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.395279642897	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.816735702763	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.149924153267	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.312132830465	OK.
0.0	0.395417819244	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.568985122593	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.521953206416	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.409464610253	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.224121032378	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.710995806264	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.258943640642	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.211970151944	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.258048408282	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.224158736798	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.373176493752	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.413216649923	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.343023562629	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.13585151151	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.375273851967	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.512131996145	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.221689779486	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.348052909327	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.404168273124	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.335516557743	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.432953570268	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.393995713953	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.567975428116	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.487519137177	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.5	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.516436140975	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.454715737502	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.357345147884	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.612646334698	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.44635038168	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.271349077628	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.50907751334	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.516992119555	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.658626359285	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.352895027856	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.316575347356	Well, sure.
0.0	0.485541153925	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.424965671644	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.43741759695	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.36535825464	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.437089481435	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.237403072827	I totally get that.
0.0	0.281489475556	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.432412709419	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.454150781948	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.35592693226	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.350588376593	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.394717275892	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.452609272941	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.397835500042	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.616855184716	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.440510202096	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.765724883656	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.273031050648	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.389851578314	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.836502483137	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.460256801514	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.332465441014	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.485832695801	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.113229773967	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.405594423802	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.64192014386	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.574762328437	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.295876605874	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.30280453974	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.543852000709	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.583674844759	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.347752922228	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.867000547438	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.373065457405	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.480044759929	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.5	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.352706023246	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.280236138703	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.420938800701	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.620387417149	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.254122353502	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.297960190308	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.551409493637	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.229407913568	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.5	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.238185559225	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.196811544335	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.636856337765	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
1.0	0.36873955169	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.54757278588	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.652023118175	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.752760441051	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.23842158248	You find me...
0.0	0.385726806055	John?

0.0	0.618165315004	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.246738846206	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.671959077629	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.209731867549	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.

0.0	0.426557165452	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.330285290536	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.210780074527	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.271516412844	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.246152570135	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.50665106441	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.632430299745	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.573973077384	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.312132830465	Okay.

0.0	0.72211677663	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.448827740563	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.361776787113	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.382099969352	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.

0.0	0.317756996679	I've laid out...
1.0	0.489458864465	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.45645042281	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.

0.0	0.486419774342	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.566630506711	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.315920625224	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.635790269287	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.307485609154	How do I know this?
0.0	0.366810893565	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.259113356989	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.22424920376	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.464388506947	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.719997425072	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."

0.0	0.425491339772	Well, I did.
0.0	0.385943429611	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.264850150714	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.514860161696	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.480942495684	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.464837778224	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.587104658582	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.204455446545	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.274668905233	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.396861490274	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.639525631437	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.309027188733	Why?
0.0	0.477493027263	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.535813530096	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.392816614032	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.456029014184	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.400217487413	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.525859772191	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.554376076002	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.282921271021	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.707128232333	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.231523643831	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.265993084693	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.263689739389	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.519033950524	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.379686582703	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.555426688295	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.262382540612	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.230156134516	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.405314440796	That's what he is.
0.0	0.639507760035	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.415739736238	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.256575285604	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.374819199571	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.474007084703	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.555875568196	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.362149395995	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.365871336167	No.
0.0	0.41731570664	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.462089337241	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.450910268413	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.262176284611	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.375126389337	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.516534398663	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.303652382579	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.411476531559	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.360028938682	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.562422662472	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.300221106188	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.490728168242	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.41774397646	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.507922012854	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.0981932223928	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.454344626503	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.394672589499	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.417127119036	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.137185509518	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.781057402978	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.298885186485	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.482229157109	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.205340990591	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.50933223305	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.456684448497	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.560392842766	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.607647172066	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.357908534339	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.476684208575	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.

0.0	0.544026156296	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.32066556872	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.278952004482	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.462388740919	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.655589016262	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.428436377333	It never happens.
0.0	0.334095903505	I think that would have been right, as well.

0.0	0.525973932871	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.772113487979	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.633531438743	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.214273700146	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.869498425698	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.306875472473	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.565923054116	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.

1.0	0.512770008463	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.480662872229	That's fine.
0.0	0.247955790037	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.5282764815	He hit oil.
0.0	0.549121716569	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.604610443394	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.320371641708	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.830205582412	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.48666691302	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.413349598611	I never said that.
0.0	0.213350883214	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.530727100073	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.422997852932	We haven't.
0.0	0.585346740803	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.425713297182	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.225931057654	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.350214523061	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.246663699563	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.714674904295	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.355868462726	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.593842325529	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.695602541138	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.529440429895	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.359892571451	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.652975811812	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.367566778029	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.64686937381	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.350915497453	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.207689505998	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.679543839246	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.379544476698	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.458465529004	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.477100083957	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.0764616229121	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.425080478416	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.677565299444	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.371385156373	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.446989167227	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.644330446372	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.5	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.321657801658	And what we want to do is to control this.

0.0	0.199051977353	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.602025251322	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.6407296253	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.306692792463	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.423561596201	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.400264108683	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.44898935945	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.347033105729	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.684765720309	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.297814271724	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.553086975127	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.460468966337	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.553312842094	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.343422928849	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.542821357238	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.380138799346	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.529281176213	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.560199775325	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.533749826365	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.520717667687	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.254819173748	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.228296361202	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.36420991175	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.184190954529	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.376928795403	About Medicare?
0.0	0.517363248346	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.561121796557	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.241639517214	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.841615793274	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.031117456272	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.365303497489	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.469722526738	We had Boko Haram.

0.0	0.305918182174	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.668855593802	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.141193500714	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.536963392217	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.

0.0	0.0906693882957	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.369980207272	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.291212743417	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.273812853251	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.629776050055	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.

0.0	0.39202581708	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.461897878165	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.300640179381	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.466505665991	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.278054151328	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.39939293893	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.224011450084	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.434673496853	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.284506931359	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.111258821013	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.34519224816	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.694300937875	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.29294176064	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.524277889024	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.25946890998	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.516166011529	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.369007477397	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.215863763132	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.640401848539	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.67124653956	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.520494563792	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.245598163334	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.580732299978	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.658064149624	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
1.0	0.778673313481	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.474185068751	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.135656143571	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.406391876298	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.312854628441	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.361546851811	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.266481776415	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.440877623015	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.906498959052	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.253107729685	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.25097090708	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.170059271581	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.489786462235	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.592119435783	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.373565348857	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.365871336167	No.
0.0	0.443312784107	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.427093082741	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.286678103566	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.172260076314	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.319974423879	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.447253488727	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.5	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.371920505081	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.445727097856	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.363521129632	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.64498145397	You had two one hundred...
1.0	0.829331129255	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.448304497976	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.253031875989	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.525322024674	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.565899711576	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.455115705357	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.838837249855	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.404412451994	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.253793032373	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.204583318304	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.540600516646	The world has changed.
0.0	0.676396711446	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.394863076021	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.572573988358	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.471458778569	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.546667352544	Two points.
0.0	0.340870840634	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.201721142666	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.549622907441	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.187465609061	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.380626112041	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.698838664997	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.439027034123	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.463995409431	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.199016409585	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.555657648692	Just for the record.
0.0	0.423297476558	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.262189567062	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.5	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.537612590801	When I was 21, my mom died.
1.0	0.644541909511	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.274063100238	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.267734288767	...
0.0	0.34317866608	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.23610106806	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.747213062023	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.573565099155	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.281881132004	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.387774285208	I do.
0.0	0.494066769728	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.5	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.295742555388	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.300379610455	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.669783422131	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.297800402869	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.585220169843	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.638672460246	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.360642513487	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.409257426718	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.17411915443	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.490720882998	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.349360056499	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.220476322086	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.41225857529	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.558200157151	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.29748212849	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.5	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.243079928788	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.524839648942	We don't win.
1.0	0.616217980881	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.5566893926	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.283961282823	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.401368728167	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.417743612395	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.228544107399	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.415601888817	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.584674751535	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.254543941488	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
1.0	0.535466702644	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.153962375104	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.25614231663	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.313103657897	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.546149598299	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.260328809627	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.445501838361	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.401143881312	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.383050139073	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.806592680879	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.612206331509	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.350470244715	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.15747390706	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.344156669625	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.312132830465	OK?
0.0	0.384014363596	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.718369718313	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.570545549451	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.469258240526	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.481336423493	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.5	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.443179799412	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.756128580793	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.632229196498	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.163775506724	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.261454228529	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.330341086929	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.516887135461	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.605235172051	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.26087810384	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.537871171785	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
1.0	0.549629368531	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.669815931744	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.419545662595	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.445252233642	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.398366786777	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.506031178144	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.990590940171	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.185790742172	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.37780372349	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.170847504912	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.297989276285	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.543628970238	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.455192077214	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.573980089346	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.418835065819	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.1643594111	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.335683044147	So...
0.0	0.599968410589	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.233705849085	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.453713285849	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.366045539167	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.54319284163	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
1.0	0.445700091035	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.537544419402	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.448749415932	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.505771323378	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.26657795904	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.450278909892	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.161490149544	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.39687823247	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.419392179016	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.440352524216	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.201141297132	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.5	We'll go to the Congress.

0.0	0.506102361098	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.512202990947	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.14769565636	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.514108136913	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.29639062247	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.551641751068	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.

0.0	0.156445760276	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.41219613401	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.45102626065	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.279294825352	You count on it.
0.0	0.374287739091	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
1.0	0.646499634118	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.172176251788	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.449003811894	That's my bill.
0.0	0.361439036805	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.601720904132	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
1.0	0.796749867234	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.389236016251	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.285971841323	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.258670708069	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.518172368647	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.179013759831	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.566399728805	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.477317263726	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.43894581735	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.390957296581	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.

0.0	0.224403659907	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.375052375822	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.381596164648	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.793975122916	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.100834674479	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.529527289962	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.270513099268	But I think they will see a very good option here.

0.0	0.634010043331	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.317116575263	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.567251022246	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.908969441288	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.312132830465	Yeah.
0.0	0.365871336167	No.
0.0	0.339917367553	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.349548965042	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.124470760938	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.336729303346	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.552721482331	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.754175015448	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.361508874168	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.538694799486	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.657066071676	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.254883094299	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.544196572238	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.417117442788	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.469722526738	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.5	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.585378203864	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.422997852932	You're right.
0.0	0.560690967603	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.411236102668	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.512564835981	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.46767212487	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.330542939292	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.66342291821	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.210811528522	Came out great.
0.0	0.359532907436	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.294342380578	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.314994783566	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.488224991077	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
1.0	0.349278293749	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.161451427405	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.890361303403	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.833369055596	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.505071339772	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.199735467723	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.318863872446	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.223115824894	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.345980314633	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.641157047406	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.447062801366	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.420230217585	I got that.
0.0	0.449950152671	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.369576158379	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.319966868453	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.671744154672	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.300779669414	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.795774958483	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.545879427901	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.637937840798	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.34980706736	See?
0.0	0.297400590626	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.368943294677	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.312132830465	OK?
0.0	0.211876254066	And here's why.
0.0	0.306219917584	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.448229070909	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.515151929476	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.0773773554229	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.349858260005	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.546128000579	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.420403946927	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.335948236046	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.400218987596	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
1.0	0.854055491165	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.630918720599	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.269037628705	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.246683791154	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.385726806055	Alright.
0.0	0.322938355599	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.524671489741	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.0794827353184	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.411563842191	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.706427153058	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.42223666478	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.127399079379	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.354251819226	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.660568792404	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
1.0	0.573847209357	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.634980010219	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.625623978336	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.344870647031	We need sound money.
0.0	0.364072625527	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.5	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.348285473736	Think about it.
0.0	0.476502105169	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.363870550816	I don't like that.
0.0	0.235051518304	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.418652218645	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.837438004332	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.329192416902	Becky --
0.0	0.269044759929	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.453417061987	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.375504729247	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.195479943109	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.445098513438	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.205257065407	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
1.0	0.565043614661	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.122442230384	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.213946573462	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.429352299538	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.591811578299	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.406626567928	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.259909777681	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.486752367755	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.28244835672	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.19908146458	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.125019913642	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.3635098036	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
1.0	0.611884242749	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.220392266329	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.465471263947	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.652909588858	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.304463889318	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.429748823185	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.553459695973	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.451236055107	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.422997852932	You're right.
0.0	0.305151876515	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.458427788597	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.543926739774	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.594948649145	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.437054470446	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.469281137876	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.312132830465	Yes.
0.0	0.337345541617	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.555380863972	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.430164445093	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.291026795388	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.351915327089	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.260846743075	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.335863871617	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.463679628551	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.470465127059	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.356148245431	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.447573367839	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.686138138497	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.270507202091	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.223124074738	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.614609018247	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.470988802456	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.414333908124	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.678962006967	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.424386386906	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.678041934137	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
1.0	0.830407147178	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.316105804168	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.234068676187	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.

0.0	0.408663172119	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.331033072127	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.312811372215	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.590163121907	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.553563293025	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.453216992736	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.419581222915	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.127072854122	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.483888509093	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.743612363409	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.40187716751	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.445486432766	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.285644332746	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.247481915744	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.510129583626	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.320286977495	Why is that?
0.0	0.374920768186	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.407317632758	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.267734288767	...
0.0	0.368275717207	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.291015600785	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.5	They want those planes made in China.

0.0	0.434263713416	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.378369269413	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.400918295822	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.188120952169	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.732839661599	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.585389135496	And you know what?
0.0	0.33523147433	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.280947015519	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.595891675372	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.492691114369	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.270449310281	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.882474147813	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.361371425333	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.110696363005	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.18426938327	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.241209396113	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.304730875523	How great is that?
0.0	0.562714239801	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.369583186602	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.369244093338	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
1.0	0.707152888418	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.537612590801	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.614496771348	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.353132995371	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.444868312639	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.329660247135	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.405274673533	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.341112285029	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.39447627416	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.465593738593	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.438764059427	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.240201054295	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.29891043486	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.367776162618	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.131939366052	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.237076229122	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.45704779683	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.640702224996	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.472215947532	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.350375055131	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.58415218667	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.465039728598	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.292060993059	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.233446914138	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.380589565282	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.520185130938	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.475962316445	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.594541293246	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.446774940958	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.486988394199	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.686356586976	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.303948509865	It's not working.
0.0	0.270577665939	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.491998950724	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.418736648364	You know why three?
0.0	0.487045103807	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.55205196387	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.363271553104	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.316903729363	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.547267316064	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.588875647898	We need to reform Social Security.
1.0	0.460968369773	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.4559189455	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.348244197785	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.401165603733	He does great.
0.0	0.297946302842	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.493871299974	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.560347411671	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.456846650061	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.227466359835	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.411793383283	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.388129868887	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.467963268339	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1.0	0.507224668319	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.430060430812	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.466706547292	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.5	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
1.0	0.507085071989	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.387564621218	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.384576580448	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
1.0	0.780691667717	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.559944483629	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.605394119576	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.331165652886	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.240802337363	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.404714649366	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.0648849148322	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.317023917365	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.40537022362	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.397378603333	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.204312643418	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.129049695524	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.711351627676	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.458468408206	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.210195259608	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.487381604662	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.393186886762	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.901693848421	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.33012262499	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.268787974956	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.294236022326	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.182576460667	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.379569270366	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.410502885227	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.446036564653	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.367888233368	Let's talk about our campaigns.
1.0	0.331827330001	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.314796151485	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.544445551987	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.390692777073	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.645764438684	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.651617396554	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.268729540921	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.438788857887	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.466504992871	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.216075617569	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.578704911528	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.493176262964	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.401304796223	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.472962165566	She was right.
0.0	0.329287886668	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.41559279836	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.540394393307	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.541726418039	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.431097175608	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.337447465457	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.150240300084	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.511762705359	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.586451377491	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
1.0	0.348777692892	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.369618150429	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.210780074527	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.299001513745	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.331034076146	I have...
0.0	0.204001665685	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.429317435162	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.48251283181	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.40697555868	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.439973657859	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.548585727026	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.345735709854	You know why?
0.0	0.394457586024	And we are not England.
0.0	0.315893351277	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.267315609523	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.635703223995	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.453670893608	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.348716664698	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.469234266423	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.213403418839	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.583509929556	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.319119903043	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.483257956421	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.316292904776	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.210099028921	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.187842069505	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.386039533203	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.382094352595	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.460647807468	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.788494335281	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.505409122935	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.564100554833	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.701119316845	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.752544313375	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.260611508537	And why?
0.0	0.368052846798	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.5	You're simply not.
0.0	0.48094923267	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.301572732711	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.526936741345	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.297538952102	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.523870808902	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.35299078544	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.458263581034	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
1.0	0.52427432074	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.234507296243	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.205080406998	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.53702055535	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.350193946985	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.556826105157	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.376658688883	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.354643800668	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.307703209666	I will do that in Washington.
1.0	0.599824132198	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.43055575758	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.447828623394	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.419873658536	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.369644226483	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.157473413056	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.573727074901	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.284035492932	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.39479746064	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.424786191101	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.320752626682	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.541729134861	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.158530915479	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.448979996086	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.410061486132	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.603682101265	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.530016002392	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.286477487028	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.0776333062688	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.370372438504	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.557274975225	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.461107828798	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.683414680651	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.412912272567	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.291064324632	I'll say this.
0.0	0.204466295123	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.456755365243	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.617779213662	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.372969023958	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.57525818555	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.593472400521	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.575212882776	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.472762723372	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.306446479992	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.349041741706	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.367732197149	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
1.0	0.713811018061	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.289175932807	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.588912372831	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.185654284211	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.232570832443	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.523704443239	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.617446311645	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.527701552315	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.369189167529	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.22735237882	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.53085067676	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.144034139291	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
1.0	0.321894174831	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.282242959896	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.555929288545	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.354246709877	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.423979999064	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.449125661703	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.540505303971	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.736209143512	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.461160559492	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.127429274726	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.469948539459	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.800748151301	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.280326397242	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.380898135182	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.305894371512	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.305185664711	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.243459501451	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.54015750873	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.527660832495	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.464762713621	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.224823676116	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.427074865867	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.248093472122	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.313377935109	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.546525148889	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.454330890567	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.528064542987	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.461105972765	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.437061993347	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.302114962696	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.430457841129	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.647167064607	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.385556958174	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.375824897054	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.440662216034	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.546493519241	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.435856634746	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.431675486194	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.549063531517	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.621088813397	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.458216791971	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.549253530001	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.365871336167	No.
0.0	0.414737585699	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.57878402613	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.436062477795	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.507331115184	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.405782683002	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.464037970421	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.533299678337	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.320560709894	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.472215947532	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.513946952141	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.314874226699	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.481638631958	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.158604962997	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.511594148498	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.445301899522	See, here's the thing.
1.0	0.505802588904	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.585389135496	And you know what?
0.0	0.62161321685	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.333704437841	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.310177140269	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.376455412784	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.35663731433	Thank you.
0.0	0.27020096736	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.367879546136	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.445493517309	Now, you've got Europe.
1.0	0.549839765323	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.296662081919	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.405086865825	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.5	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.5	That's what I said.
0.0	0.341645971174	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.299540801416	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.650208754079	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.842634979596	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.399791983567	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.412841081909	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.127017334258	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.531655371137	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.405203643899	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.516855743627	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.198103419433	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.39415048423	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.590885739645	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.526001135959	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.412235109881	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.524273238887	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.354252247501	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.298611249837	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.288084264015	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.35792395482	I was the architect.
0.0	0.310649106878	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.134407120496	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.733245544089	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.195233357149	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.253549036362	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.432174579874	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.560963147524	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.400946981642	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.450134803484	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.432658212795	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.206437783893	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.30860996627	...Chris...
1.0	0.877164730215	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.5	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.424785813081	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.312121856412	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.261829694469	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.439918708151	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.533196619142	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.3605076694	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.476637432491	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.349837496935	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.58226759623	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.165098484268	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.387834852345	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.562184378883	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.469971986037	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.416117189677	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.664715269589	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.436181414636	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.327405820077	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.570143621389	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.352125213643	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.521278140652	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.118689941426	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.17423445433	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.22753661061	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.425284279426	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.534722872402	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.273885429834	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.334502981939	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.453608673594	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.0896794744361	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.249102626513	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.721064183499	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.586504761624	He just writes out an executive order.
