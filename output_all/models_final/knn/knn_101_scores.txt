0.0	0.425046703964	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.644774708353	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.55758249969	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.33975358673	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.

0.0	0.588170686022	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.622861985754	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.320769404466	It was the AFL-CIO.

0.0	0.266119120504	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.411858285682	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.

0.0	0.53894305573	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.370803491187	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.355929231783	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.658564515323	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.454040286322	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.623941953942	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
1.0	0.577733993758	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.571979702122	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.603118939963	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.635344650793	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.403016137291	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.46478841043	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.503896435592	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.287606688505	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.637650606591	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.693693934791	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.334083590551	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.574350554657	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.52685498173	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.676666917672	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.342512735055	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.0	Alright.
0.0	0.450902719051	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.53733599233	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.538940497878	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.492015982467	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.630301662027	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.428761052419	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.625434655595	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.62132443589	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.271717942011	He does great.
0.0	0.364845025227	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.399002194522	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.52587102752	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.303786528248	I'll say this.
1.0	0.449017666256	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.431633078153	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.609967718088	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.398357754418	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.692377263604	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.375215243019	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.369335974724	I never said that.
0.0	0.560091892673	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.376827552021	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.377044713937	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.504486464825	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.612367539013	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.578090517967	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.463265950941	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.45800573414	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.485345213678	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.328864496305	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.383569791131	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.291949243309	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.460800185476	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.363097833117	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.287424809271	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.52611026189	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.623681123806	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
1.0	0.618957112248	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.524535550279	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.27237424631	That's not true.
0.0	0.437713405804	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.346520817427	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.436069884692	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.216134008661	No.
0.0	0.449123186918	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.420569239021	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.524786122496	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.508853647974	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.664726202354	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.353470543139	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.510182399601	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.513792882867	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.54482479968	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.373483203085	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.544816963394	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.644055814293	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.591513874597	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.288765612765	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.549257196252	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.553041459076	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.454685084464	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
1.0	0.648711027284	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.688318904593	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.589671163412	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.250188789854	This will end.
0.0	0.53424033013	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.641056124802	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.558415093373	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.274180369769	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.498324803943	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.401941550052	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.27879703625	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.60364506986	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.362303599184	Our rights come from God.

0.0	0.429644343465	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.539254869833	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.257694189697	That's good.
0.0	0.43565773162	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.

0.0	0.489886999855	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.632128693879	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.65564815827	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.612639842161	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.541306470996	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.369980852745	No, he doesn't.

0.0	0.380581015856	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.263173864623	Two points.
0.0	0.52148301756	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.463522549494	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.

0.0	0.475206091788	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.428631958536	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.395405787761	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.393952408631	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.393883268878	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.340821349841	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.380169084041	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.527685857363	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.

0.0	0.29756412158	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.358445362452	I agree with them.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.367328780565	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.432506247596	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.318852105144	I don't like that.
0.0	0.331314759361	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.421500913621	Bernie Sanders has already said it.

0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.580785576743	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.0	Maria...
0.0	0.568006686268	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.

0.0	0.353332458247	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.591278112939	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.48078411034	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.538273791564	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.398086276019	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.637527194473	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.384037013435	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.425466650295	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.216134008661	No.
0.0	0.413745228181	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.426155964495	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.363308741968	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.571451771939	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.61362651307	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.316537081438	And you know what?
0.0	0.543014922043	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.524665037568	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.653052172397	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
1.0	0.630329528307	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.525830615627	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.616346544944	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.351036990061	You bet they do.
0.0	0.584771410891	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.418926735237	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.596356498365	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.515167187502	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.483940472657	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.464834815629	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.533614687603	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.275767846639	How great is that?
0.0	0.386049666092	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.565913926465	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.442723430876	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
1.0	0.329688624723	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.700874926192	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.544155137922	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.60469218317	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.48714473117	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.506478768046	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.515122970408	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.536035249883	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.60802095694	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.644798985829	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.307817017768	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.296288749286	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.0	John.
0.0	0.55573504005	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.314422274624	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.358527359877	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.529159341362	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.552911812691	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.646721404695	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.282190347022	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.341856539384	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.544364874473	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.287646660114	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.448126547263	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.59645903311	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.247533342433	You did.
0.0	0.324558089087	No, it's true.
0.0	0.427108055491	That is our government today.
0.0	0.411176878206	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.639917236459	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.620811794736	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.526184774111	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.296687551487	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.529440207773	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.54367737232	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.336682973982	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.642786930601	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.480628787041	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.315118514529	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.560839701842	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.520867522691	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.473807104686	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.661450250322	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.496269599871	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.605455598371	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.387852537888	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.634987888007	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.666880250912	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.434695609549	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.468759744306	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.476637657463	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.420903060578	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.530351193373	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.628872566317	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.549223714321	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.328539438966	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.488744353421	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.357485782212	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.25747997782	in particular.
0.0	0.411548036688	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.526820672387	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.544437769751	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.625257848468	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.508353033306	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.484645410423	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.367741877557	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.52936978732	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.413051100458	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.373284357111	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.495605242993	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.295262128752	You know that.
1.0	0.603039291304	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.41435348659	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.505894714998	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.

0.0	0.432564528929	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.633167445852	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.529444139218	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
1.0	0.542096479456	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.645829518848	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.470725319896	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.397608034763	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.354674851796	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.305771252175	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.555109770375	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.357470542113	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.494954103675	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.431465907055	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.498000801561	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
1.0	0.565204659214	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.677360555535	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.545272809631	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.529171996991	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.594003735201	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.535336675715	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.57275980646	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.661028736728	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.622355806663	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.

0.0	0.622716351473	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.494446411707	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.333811305851	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.590280328883	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.552913182888	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.540140265635	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.321094306833	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.532477265975	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.537511714069	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.32447667612	It's a joke.
0.0	0.273948704519	That's my view.
0.0	0.332489257926	You know why three?
0.0	0.23799363886	Say again?
0.0	0.384298092913	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.383490782862	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.594158353721	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.271744663337	Wait for what?
0.0	0.25815099777	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.379339400914	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.572663350807	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.553525492887	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.427414115519	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.505123137586	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.579019199036	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.514565754309	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.367303532554	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.368437670771	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.349354986542	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.561690299117	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.461255663383	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.374921367288	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.352066474848	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.626245836994	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.315196296449	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.63565263434	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.52806722317	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.5573997467	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.340756742015	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.455895703975	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.492275515548	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.491563056264	He was on the board.
0.0	0.352132205751	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.316163748832	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.526346539195	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.51223678884	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.299249922773	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.27101404268	We need security.
0.0	0.485309821703	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.58299503922	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.642738828781	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.296198952797	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.58358107768	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.628906333968	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.614051359191	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.63007081562	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.543001382415	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.560030241788	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.564254900871	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.526277960193	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.437713310194	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.435515078178	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.599461953007	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.339105420714	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.544881052376	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.560462306448	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.316537081438	But you know what?
0.0	0.439778780746	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.563776147443	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.50874476931	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.416261961797	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.589164260873	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.651707661802	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.345981575548	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.316560293178	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.514739276955	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.555611009051	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.379267153606	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.662493246181	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.552020149117	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.411287956803	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.460657654176	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
1.0	0.651489341637	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.348604799525	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.478180583534	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.383530645865	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.627614495735	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.594800452126	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.665981873584	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.356944745209	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.276496011535	I would just say that...
0.0	0.500824796475	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.618615030612	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
1.0	0.565427117978	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.467044727511	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.502132321037	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.410444845994	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.240223657483	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.629115663998	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.349831471587	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.261787468742	Our next president...
0.0	0.510661524159	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.40263585616	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.479031485682	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.638557730188	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.38283701967	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.543031733049	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.583826485372	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.455529212355	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.657990487019	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.447599124338	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.569398561426	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.448865391022	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.246565048425	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.651898737829	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.711149079065	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.53517537882	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.430894201762	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.357121554034	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.482266127556	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.478088669873	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.483550815351	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.531328904354	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.437244704362	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.333206781294	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.421635971042	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.370659438832	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.511142643417	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.416388663833	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.631236965324	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.407035482357	Divisive and with no vision.
1.0	0.576355087396	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.524023450125	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.597348589428	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.26004293233	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.613738482785	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.479745774849	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.370686886785	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.500228450867	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.486733598402	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	1.0	You get together.
0.0	0.553608388002	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.493956369453	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.335846399065	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.600383486585	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.285379001011	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.461341924718	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.327889871519	You have to lead.
0.0	0.457578417506	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.279904475294	That has not been...
0.0	0.663255470861	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.373009904697	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.330918953684	I know every one.
1.0	0.586454822893	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.376362457792	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.432820280959	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.459777539837	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.353034684868	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.607015404462	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.289270932545	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
1.0	0.651919041541	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.586322527829	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.541672142693	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.55841122703	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.438809022587	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.705845083033	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.296335175804	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.408697285251	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.505972463232	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.333748739971	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.380776765407	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.530700430506	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.574007683658	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.550605473343	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.515809474981	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.436011396363	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.327145205591	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.557831128	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.570734365543	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.673046783144	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.0	Dynamically.
1.0	0.496141550445	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.514581065894	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.396075655916	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.544965943366	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.597638719026	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.540617662068	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.268171706399	...No, sir...
0.0	0.292217553174	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.641490158511	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.647974348519	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.519230721702	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
1.0	0.626205183603	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.547725635887	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.620086198222	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
1.0	0.665801194379	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.627300793549	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.37648754039	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.415042775544	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.639462315269	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.520836399589	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.425374067218	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.467252511464	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
1.0	0.556040212327	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.55824109406	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.297647005659	He hit oil.
0.0	0.46448186289	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.394767464069	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.677388685323	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.698995884207	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.407730446678	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.321166535053	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.247334852834	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.250567736684	Big difference.
0.0	0.627482401861	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.405651782736	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.708736076276	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.3774323469	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.511275454598	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.625514770463	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.567353481026	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.629145060995	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.378995766253	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.632714328575	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.548008730381	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.532603842878	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.484951315606	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.406887004547	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.603847824715	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.36420325401	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.367619977274	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.359742363581	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.285968171131	We need sound money.
0.0	0.546683762754	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.534073989173	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.487755938367	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.288816001612	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.514430922375	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.549845224194	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.592130513088	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.62531468128	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.66530449975	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.46626811829	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.579010846118	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.605040222889	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.618731765787	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.300948019451	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.562725549417	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.424439926069	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.583940043849	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.579375239567	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.579651342148	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.490619634425	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.518110838575	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.640617226534	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.358409584481	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.549749183842	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.382602491815	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.353871545194	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.545565703793	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.537850848961	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.27143601062	I like it.
0.0	0.46321297219	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.6524662191	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.585192574072	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.486775829898	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.53640267726	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.323631075046	Well, I did.
0.0	0.426468025207	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.311133045679	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.636652994888	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.587085794527	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.450110644628	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.30976905777	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.28799153209	I got that.
0.0	0.293438549347	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.39921500019	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.500254053574	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.491750099751	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.633393917864	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.253395316789	I win.
0.0	0.317503939073	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.508136425152	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.546351037432	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.36851446641	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.440141201029	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.660728984036	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.392056734614	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.631780134684	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.280858295162	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.45380921753	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.434235370421	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.576876850954	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.516487058697	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.544129872187	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.659605609462	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.38796323148	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.346640894809	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.534193306422	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.398199049174	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.528982599267	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
1.0	0.582629437259	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.598699591303	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.554002819161	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.388689162409	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.577577984453	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.523570604709	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.503061228534	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.316072940843	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.514996417796	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.509540044577	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.629559588854	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.353738804269	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.729216866818	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.497020732097	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.481065446402	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.479113684709	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
1.0	0.606349346213	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.606673958503	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.361254353838	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.285696118913	We're running.
0.0	0.420380255632	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.433450405328	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.273435450467	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.514497197349	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.603031066596	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.602663176833	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.341316789429	We are not France.
0.0	0.602405730771	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.658331546679	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.30444713945	This country is changing.
0.0	0.512931527028	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.643782686239	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.370357854115	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.668033196702	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.489995990071	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.625598719638	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.351882446816	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.638248140375	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.442024682777	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.324560637007	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.318879452074	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.557291208152	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.653413942497	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.580839179237	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.50204332653	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.563776147443	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.427014653973	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.543979215443	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.666635115647	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.566521433974	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.567317072584	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.601884548932	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
1.0	0.695516106896	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.619494060404	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.414158459287	This is a business flat tax.
1.0	0.382027737573	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.532478841157	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.623310346499	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.511407738466	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.239603762348	No -- no...
0.0	0.531791690663	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.502117971403	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.337813099825	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.650035129671	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.553010555973	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.622847359985	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.51435434794	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.511467025804	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.59105528178	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.708720391023	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.229167136229	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.604463891732	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.525927929683	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.549081064074	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.429805399965	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.644616416232	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.446652896436	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.303786528248	I will do that.
0.0	0.326131919588	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.639772202741	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.517631271645	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.372292161344	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.540498710787	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.635918896858	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.272391166926	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.404254169177	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.373336659325	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.238205166864	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.501274245091	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.590052160059	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.588033299536	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.314524850991	That's the difference.
0.0	0.51140547952	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.51880699052	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.553470633583	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.608457618347	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.555959928767	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.585092376098	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.451276275404	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.600560538695	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.456164092592	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.630168581165	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.322342784672	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.619778142906	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.279769478513	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.552099899254	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.457227693455	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.638449127282	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.237731291097	And so do I.
0.0	0.630465319151	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.345548227599	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.659639463704	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.566948301301	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.273768963731	No, John.
0.0	0.335741754008	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.323570015993	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.54039348223	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.377066303108	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.572666505569	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.601542116488	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.451025163639	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.307310754473	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.394980153708	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.528491527981	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.320858040309	How do I know this?
0.0	0.504503740559	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.449205935738	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.422350415876	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
1.0	0.585090443331	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.408134092119	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.569127676623	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.58638484018	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.569528374031	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.579222909039	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.41663552211	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.341031630772	The number of women --
0.0	0.650346756189	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.395052807007	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.51176289241	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.536924719355	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.519067989466	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.216134008661	No.
0.0	0.555511316338	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.485521226186	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.555326839404	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.541581915608	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.580692424372	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.0	...
1.0	0.643091491098	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.593536578571	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.377558750182	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.474126222264	Is there an area for a safety net?
1.0	0.658872565457	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.516386788606	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.216861375786	Why?
0.0	0.387153384904	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.664959951563	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.478030743418	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.623936981385	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.411803740504	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
1.0	0.356795309497	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.301060891353	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.603689693055	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.556477527962	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.342202154379	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.506111391222	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.695476534097	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.444487104677	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.515893036642	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.638421108316	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.642364962824	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.491922568903	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.367712581796	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.521594799062	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.64177302831	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.33558126281	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.263500653023	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.443156752397	And loose money is one of the major problems.
1.0	0.579207464232	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.600642023473	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.507849463837	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
1.0	0.684960114865	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.646575295227	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.511862706602	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.407508342631	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.362790121944	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.526806071576	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.623801557392	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.537366282599	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.507926330027	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.338710674966	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.626686782325	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.3711125859	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.644531510946	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.322962015291	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.606502380467	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.631746357794	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.402524100869	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.376327147283	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.41890408816	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.296816683139	We have to obey the laws.
1.0	0.531520233954	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.600221291904	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.589570540463	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.400814089991	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.621621941446	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.405462268832	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.596257712133	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.481807680498	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.384852558479	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.48162892293	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.569425259484	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.625166056127	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.292482823516	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.427077677262	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.494148067542	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.557527682353	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.461392274449	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.323114290816	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.54657458717	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.321286493299	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.530012865587	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.37574503289	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.487721990133	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.39038767839	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.437059378654	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.551114252206	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.452066216945	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.308442618411	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.563991506576	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.641507189826	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.498955457367	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.531411756624	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.379633042477	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.547165636116	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	1.0	You're right.
0.0	0.280551905142	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.712117819185	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.649408760564	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.334214064923	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.425936934524	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.371630405965	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.498537130182	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.614582642206	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.212689592935	These...
0.0	0.580371999685	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.388330236023	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.353681796959	You looking at me?
0.0	0.524367874144	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.39436761956	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.369932686334	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.54724902719	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.526934573377	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.6478471858	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.35606580521	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.621209367237	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.48846362807	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.586223442117	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.61531074823	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.581291271849	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.442566394881	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.494158458697	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.564015217372	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.537508304124	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.518043776499	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.610445149265	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.347620757213	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.449002021008	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.499778587745	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.50631682755	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.632731850853	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.489274369682	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.538653183575	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.636797859277	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.662314310142	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.461174584943	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.282263174831	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
1.0	0.555627763126	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.317136066253	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.474865906417	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.581041139672	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.576789504955	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.342618935466	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.648370577862	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.497805819602	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.587408571031	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.305475927582	You do legislation.
0.0	0.570337845729	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.

0.0	0.385980166955	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.494446112126	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.

0.0	0.416584468185	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.342326066097	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.647587893071	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.

0.0	0.360340895982	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.65714445135	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.352341181224	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.662483479974	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.27920364898	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.252159953475	It is.
0.0	0.638530139514	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.530185772055	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.610294704097	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.390687207929	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.484742928171	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.579867153045	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.685771546293	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
1.0	0.645618157337	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.502013783213	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.334096444831	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.430886269454	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.276202932074	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.263444978104	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.673646253842	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.30810430392	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.534089748792	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.498758947837	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.440169627202	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.452480235792	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.417291413161	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.658045280298	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.238767766144	...John...
0.0	0.589999078838	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.632869696792	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.480314989012	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
1.0	0.758270142058	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.376239855343	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	1.0	Of course not.
0.0	0.258984600121	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.302302344825	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.588870946733	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.492137869785	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.525455558723	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.626775486151	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.489844264604	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.631498106459	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.252046159489	You do.
0.0	0.550130867555	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.385795068965	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.247334852834	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.55064909648	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.513517615793	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.635745126978	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.257535627222	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.211467853823	See?
0.0	0.415303697575	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.433785346766	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.557558546538	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.386516420475	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.275762327985	I'm ready.
0.0	0.359972955725	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.374122546045	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.514208010217	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.323804480475	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.484025337662	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.271230604076	...Thank you.
0.0	0.392915913559	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.377696236746	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.414361891407	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.611944839683	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.261629643131	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.379110180176	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.584700177618	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.387724900502	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.582891716193	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.654457371037	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.503181641155	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.562603736583	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.39747593243	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
1.0	0.468651024792	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.526306629644	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.350042919495	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.606531418863	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.359074708596	We lose on trade.
1.0	0.589333055902	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.40353223805	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.331714562596	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.312724415983	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.474744421778	Run the company kids, have a good time.
1.0	0.655989723168	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.267404641658	Check it out.
0.0	0.309871244461	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.40281075494	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.407889785947	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.490029866041	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.343446020468	We can't do it.
0.0	0.369249953115	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.491663109825	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.492098768764	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.641740530878	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.667173468266	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.321488878509	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.287819028098	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.634453384066	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.559862337401	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.500961053273	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.325557703334	...before I go.
0.0	0.606327099927	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.293575931053	So you might not.
0.0	0.441884463242	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.490096955735	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.628026408999	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.361851061826	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.602085142258	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.341940605519	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.469248867731	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.634755366505	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.36602542012	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.489984452333	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.285182997403	I would change them.
0.0	0.508939641086	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.634342792022	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.464297396821	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.478809613208	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.66249030151	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.344501279638	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.438900113751	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.273825145243	I said no.
0.0	0.268561811332	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.459813040596	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.483720466398	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.335287587053	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.28632104556	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.542852762981	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.500889187388	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.300565396849	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.355360437047	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.384127657173	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.422283250899	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.570612901737	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.402229748721	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.267065185819	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.477555182501	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.393111964761	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.362709948385	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.536873297465	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.586099390797	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.421664729606	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.380133207995	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.441002547915	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
1.0	0.58357953472	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.502745358986	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.453301026223	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.428380678756	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.586964082468	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.598535337373	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.679139461746	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
1.0	0.591214507193	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.293592693916	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.613742583273	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.296222312853	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.325425227129	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.573504321355	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.341165030221	I have no idea.
0.0	0.613185795225	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.531584491018	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.362503931807	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.418010822774	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.463852925909	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.688539864588	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.573357790789	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.589331762277	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.385499310204	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.607655209917	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.321109147604	Now, we're going to blame the people.
1.0	0.634140853871	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.46122364133	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.358279003032	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.216134008661	No.
0.0	0.531374212261	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.635148061825	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.477650742906	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.561896717144	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.301459958242	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.388047821216	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.368373972828	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.628012813862	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.637114606687	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.500555365339	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.474824755845	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.404981772895	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.313767055825	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.36679879669	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.585808705095	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.0	Neil...
0.0	0.550941545945	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.396246685284	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.466032367601	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.403622902357	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.535790212372	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.492574562274	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.557070279724	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.461628483891	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.448428509824	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.59972977001	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
1.0	0.67635042563	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.343446020468	I can't do it.
0.0	0.547809826371	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.320038639613	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.496088152361	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
1.0	0.653799528146	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.636145672868	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.553221946432	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.349581117495	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.318104112789	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.346794823691	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.591223217287	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.476000952641	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.511576703968	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.518714357189	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.488905389656	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.5424212591	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.415402294812	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.638597610976	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.344887263146	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.59852171506	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.511807728064	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.348995173132	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.688494360249	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.541958615336	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.578670185503	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.366163895559	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.387040734927	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.29052115392	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.597640226379	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.602920232843	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.387953599381	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
1.0	0.42601115952	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.551794102311	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.314027026349	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.617611946485	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.476723606873	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.510460854649	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.281997758379	That is not right.
0.0	0.638514946765	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.580412427421	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.642446209355	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.405287209578	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.490198604296	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.376490816225	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.356901315594	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.542317410516	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.580926300439	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.542467761417	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.360934071604	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.361044051984	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.336225168446	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.399788503471	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.433528396175	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.527348541473	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.511124193891	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.635289927497	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.671391878042	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.61448195704	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.321240015541	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.392368653055	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.430556608265	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.57813719748	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.460585640307	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.377911643197	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.690401642838	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.387117742073	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.427171535519	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.315954806386	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.348041379006	They're a scam.
0.0	0.391667132179	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
1.0	0.259544158476	They were wrong.
0.0	0.443618163203	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.543381248845	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.570526621873	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.659223264142	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.367628438168	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.534459792739	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.612753276313	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.430086888165	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.401593314466	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.526029344477	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.307756669279	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.572955372883	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.231022150726	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.649747020838	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.402174825365	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.534334357833	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
1.0	0.539813750125	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.336838567455	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.321078139729	No, you did.
0.0	0.536135014686	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.529302821077	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.0	I don't care.
0.0	0.555398022376	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.389472314628	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.500111006996	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.344981070504	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.361548293904	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.37922729902	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.577623789379	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.646110966594	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.311467884878	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.383252366299	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.341235970745	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.453703897088	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.44881703978	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.401280208811	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.560167276739	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.520465826173	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.586040156919	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.530761360272	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.644686947614	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.537534751054	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.359373459115	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.537032507167	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.620533564435	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.590773767195	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.568489496173	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.266200256135	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.430148369119	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.568571422477	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.281997758379	That's not right.
0.0	0.37047722923	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.366728311514	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.399837969669	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.437962483232	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.37155662394	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.507864512592	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.621169271953	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.450464383909	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.628598732706	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.418883654461	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.631903190794	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.31128983085	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.284040715591	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.645887342211	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.492355663886	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.591124802998	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.673750881709	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.320704114386	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.49245673118	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.549284968429	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
1.0	0.252096017819	Very few children.
1.0	0.385769324992	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.524789185674	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.362564325755	No vision at all.
0.0	0.555524071031	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.62947764571	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.558844421804	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.0	Creativity.
0.0	0.438320070555	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.371483937486	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.521286586454	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.631031684743	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.460056930346	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.607004526444	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.628300035661	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.485593095891	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.525873093739	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.453736830222	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.526379399781	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.448861561194	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.38846443434	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.392395193166	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
1.0	0.669990523745	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.360943606326	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.432032488054	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
1.0	0.247638713193	That's wrong.

0.0	0.457384742688	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.583185747548	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.618313684183	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.571202288825	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.297022228544	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.631780182707	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.580137055451	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.638217883897	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.557881589407	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.51660583207	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.346276290655	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.334144198728	This would be devastating for the economy.
1.0	0.599258184816	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.382434297395	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.614228446162	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.365622957278	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.423468901818	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.635413707154	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.431633078153	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.574741681469	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.560130125992	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.459945930574	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.38768233288	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.631826929087	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.645863617151	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.272128894375	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.670777241473	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.29488368546	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.494424568262	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.502660820779	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.308844593806	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.639323858609	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.338710674966	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.51006908903	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.529319568236	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.377408258836	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.295297716395	That's my bill.
0.0	0.648851260445	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.257683283124	OK, good.
0.0	0.251167227619	They know.
0.0	0.608867856887	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.666071023246	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.596051050034	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.238767766144	...Chris...
0.0	0.272548877663	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.628657575137	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.614635765016	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.478817792082	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.659689373038	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.473089398741	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.313125681734	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.280403624178	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.644180514497	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.577955683058	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.621655032761	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.3069981803	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.477998178593	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.693949048296	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.35478035861	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.469733757938	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.286396534942	We're running.
0.0	0.560823615928	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.63841701667	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.51662833314	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.564394437198	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.590730553881	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.359422073648	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.520064972132	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.664710270801	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.559616830416	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.426820584866	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.553353880874	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.311008078061	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.394161080984	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.590621688059	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.526290663429	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.314066468019	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.534923729556	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.645447919034	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.376744362107	That's what I said.
0.0	0.427183451986	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.353289454351	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.576779221107	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.506087769956	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.590247197333	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.378317637137	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.56587692349	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.353567035461	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.598126020825	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.625421009857	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.556730136818	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.403661415793	I want to talk to the folks at home.
1.0	0.713290746469	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.513973649929	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.266257543425	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.423742872086	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.252447163817	He's wrong.
0.0	0.46632540505	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.506846093908	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.644606375294	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.370732575659	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.490452763133	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.46305206953	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
1.0	0.64182782691	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.267223317596	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.524005458122	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.609398188342	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.420889822822	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.508425887845	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.28887191971	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.527643562201	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.529275359653	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.49001340393	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.489097446973	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.36710199652	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.348796417962	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.331183433166	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.579343656684	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.625322844058	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.576929117814	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.357712060646	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.567141087243	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.467208513823	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.523624963517	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.410988654112	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.248214930196	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.48870848999	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.352056782432	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.609387026638	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.314516348259	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.474370915871	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.632758314555	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.306286959886	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.621998729568	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.582878663623	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.269994845909	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.369936106307	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.332110031265	I will not do that.
0.0	0.0	Ever.
1.0	0.442188760791	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.484690433921	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.513291241855	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.580838171505	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.344508447903	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.351003299809	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.544226879556	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.409115555664	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.417042835331	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.307349182641	to save a company.
0.0	0.64048905433	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.344028774433	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.476173038095	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.657623565689	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.42563269127	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.612067549543	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.645811089359	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.344921351262	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.662979935279	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.472081412942	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.262006464781	My background is different.
0.0	0.59314419425	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.399278066919	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.558963428803	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.60442932605	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.450693927565	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.486878732215	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.333482577128	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.573837950395	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.400726559908	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.414758292804	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.37454544675	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.643969094447	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.590320801757	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.569047667542	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.381729789533	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.265284664372	It feels different.
0.0	0.597744232891	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.365310856902	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.536625371933	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.565880749972	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.360915378322	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.480522793883	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.604636101306	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.388082042974	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.468165603104	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.63357763165	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.29137037254	I changed that.
0.0	0.611317738308	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.626960382913	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.399600478965	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.318893815135	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.660196398508	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.565442690612	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.580379328851	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.572660607837	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.352687012463	We have to put more money.

0.0	0.52513587009	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.640883137841	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.588445233097	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.589176581822	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.51451691144	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.613368230928	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.352506864928	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.51225496264	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.413671300274	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.407065097321	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.0	She was right.
0.0	0.603476313635	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.341517735576	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.500251709933	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.575230153915	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.531995705401	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.466954498566	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.628546682558	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.463194005634	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.460395478077	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.553490652278	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.301378937851	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.496772500485	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.457470497793	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.528940294045	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.573530341509	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.340147651011	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.653563416529	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.707353298026	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.60852876408	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.640479747872	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.329903866134	I think he is right.
0.0	0.648453184454	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.247334852834	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.547687505865	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.5441555409	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.546016804724	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.697230163834	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.473012766728	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.448315288245	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.513975009276	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.632295485889	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.550984213776	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.565481940482	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.530963111089	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.482943376283	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.549632998247	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.558404468948	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.448699314275	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.63774746406	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.588169109657	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.477113768983	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.498490631936	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.515607092496	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.446058138915	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.613929276208	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.626847120378	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.399832078323	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.277348675534	I want security.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.541796555437	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.548110320461	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.562441275362	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.543671872982	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.326732256824	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.271790017542	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.382655903719	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.636422656198	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.561367902123	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.415015159956	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.308625944322	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.354185824174	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.409247729042	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.415498513162	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.39870747209	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.481096320321	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.293227086116	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.367668098741	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.49102385489	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.617816569218	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.288527360304	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.666911250268	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.545702428088	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.510944898323	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.253685059126	I promise.
0.0	0.253727611629	I understand.
0.0	0.621622536751	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.547816233928	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.495426723473	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.304672110406	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.247533342433	It was.
0.0	0.473946746075	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.564871071991	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.301580729432	I've laid out...
0.0	0.336647457086	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.443488366828	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.592916968717	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.236484874776	But look...
0.0	0.347107948136	They're a scam.
0.0	0.598487611829	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.524539524656	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.638614266593	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.660938967564	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.264305980684	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.216134008661	No.
0.0	0.239354626716	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.65797680635	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.391964881212	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.340848365818	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.44637147684	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.647669693852	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.541461801658	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.488500811493	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.241424808926	White people?
0.0	0.300028826441	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.304951700798	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.512603150238	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.41587841405	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.465788817219	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.328677904169	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.316949047985	The answer is no.
0.0	0.479860361997	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.449330254087	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.550447125664	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.576201533597	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.472739040651	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.427442927958	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.628310027836	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
1.0	0.661874662191	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.445068397464	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.632762358657	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.54607359732	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.329278948183	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.59169578571	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.665367412199	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.27625516941	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.505379090037	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.543154376572	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.602253216363	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.65226905301	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.493720740781	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.425290420217	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.375534085219	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.45144748481	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.583905714422	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.286179857188	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.579547446005	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.461072495646	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.316537081438	And you know what?
0.0	0.572648924269	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
1.0	0.306817913479	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
1.0	0.633460589881	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.659155675479	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.371313269804	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.441825944501	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.594612307364	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.537950216267	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.301467516079	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.530369668356	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.384456096013	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.453563054679	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.312609704901	And here's why.
0.0	0.550749260332	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.530862339037	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.590653146092	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.619286941888	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.529618510829	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.446579495764	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.610139880022	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.267404641658	Check it out.
0.0	0.58072443876	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.415475681643	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.329483302782	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.464625434737	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.495319037783	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.463136071636	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.364032707105	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.57145421164	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.626271751657	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.560824302002	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.344275005076	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.373583767957	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.483900315207	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.538243973954	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.567372344902	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.421237764351	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.2807031374	Why is that?
0.0	0.664213726862	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.452183771996	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.608651389057	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.515007173448	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.434251300688	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.579550210173	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.298836762372	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.651624010917	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.320706980304	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.558394915118	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.494711735922	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.673230362506	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
1.0	0.645331704807	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.349676399487	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.321814458919	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.505018865766	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.31342680573	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.460014419533	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.378434999679	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
1.0	0.62746687831	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.437217061988	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.378481827409	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.399872747005	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.453771967022	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.313469418163	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.362036301624	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.649623265275	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.694409161657	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.441937959423	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.452937033384	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.481240317192	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.335204440335	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.558828711348	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.649071533364	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.435796408882	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.596263126833	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.387996369509	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.337261998207	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.311788631597	And for good cause.
0.0	0.581441669443	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.389448494922	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.276497433576	Came out great.
1.0	0.703864218381	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.589221043642	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.664484416478	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.389596740372	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.64318439855	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.593289767786	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.273094888245	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.458365531123	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.535835791651	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.268180716042	How about this?
0.0	0.446379394697	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.426539089006	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.34770842575	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.635483662494	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.370948517279	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.413975199071	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.38187568982	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.384474586708	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.576559342884	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.333984742907	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.252046159489	I do.
0.0	0.309257048104	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.282984690546	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.588704696698	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.304471604022	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.545220384245	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.255710140381	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.362596260891	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.453665877998	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.536456413335	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.503545539017	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.377824319778	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.396090484437	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.616500651316	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.36651622231	You count on it.
0.0	0.498975132181	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.594336943365	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.644421683825	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.420675890083	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.491012484379	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.590631194446	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.349858796114	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.544859547726	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.644105759658	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.609131505906	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.493338662806	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.369232614555	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.514015125694	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.627521283466	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.373777871189	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.551511147785	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.604198508106	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.415775894354	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.446665522173	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.442327166055	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.29813866088	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.55900325235	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
1.0	0.672229917561	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.296045403606	You can have him.
0.0	0.648487726603	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.644236338996	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.525411687342	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
1.0	0.356552579771	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.632211503331	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
1.0	0.5902669831	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.364887518925	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.525469661157	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.451019685941	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.373118347057	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.628688507377	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.540162374367	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.257106438119	Both served.
0.0	0.514403239881	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.560646250528	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.57930834776	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.361178555551	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.34089019214	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.595498860169	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.559876877217	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.31328383843	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.452451345525	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.596074485321	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.708502046977	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.28757900531	I mean, you know...
1.0	0.517843985734	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.50143344382	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.395113169551	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.269113631872	You just want to...
0.0	0.252046159489	I have.
0.0	0.669038964901	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.425346492369	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.538804780613	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.413306021621	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.623745382451	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.372052251073	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.579698149421	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.342755018122	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.359435439412	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.364336141341	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.353690617857	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.271150059917	We're friends.
0.0	0.266679730654	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.379899007849	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.54343143152	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.392456800952	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.561165108958	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.33050986138	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.34503220276	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.32388525569	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.545505448147	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.59871778419	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.450127503988	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.57993411596	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.393452137826	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.388862316827	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.409799779642	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.306320793196	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.667142880843	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.643199832574	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.26860274101	You're welcome.
0.0	0.290011740946	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.401735507075	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.660334364812	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.544307117294	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.452899572781	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.474951957124	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.593768998854	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.53131428582	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.407462557474	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.302602070003	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.448637897595	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.478565103163	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.288756804358	It never happens.
0.0	0.540459664763	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.584446886809	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.516494492807	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.503712697053	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.388259107295	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.260559859978	Divide that out.
0.0	0.613914979256	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.553085032806	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.516120304272	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.444853373013	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.544932719241	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.480253948053	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.479470489276	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.586881456779	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.482927414744	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.573060671791	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.285454107828	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.543961387952	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.309211313127	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.620675449119	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.48503880706	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.48575171274	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.39338598032	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.453736710165	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.563685222818	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.626735452627	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.59264725915	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.502997743167	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.476465085784	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.621334914365	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.376486668219	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.542224325765	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.530165151535	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.577499366232	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.549549187175	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.501207180701	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.640055823156	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.317651851369	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.534789690655	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.370524844526	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.438786598788	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.549144435133	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.556284353692	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.532566611304	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.405480153908	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.63579824266	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.721920522442	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.34215602724	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.326965248932	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.359906170466	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.423444402053	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.337814178693	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.354502940653	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.359725106711	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.579506772951	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.623689136033	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.60693626536	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.399455318466	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.493345454317	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.404825037597	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.553558829799	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.569225659204	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.450207758903	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.50755606541	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.362868530863	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.570767644916	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.569365163683	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.450214900614	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.631909952945	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.588353948146	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
1.0	0.573004815918	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.267724952371	No their not.
0.0	0.592519218355	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.569273048074	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.485766111134	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.30656415403	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.297447201994	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.320948063873	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.652341186299	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.621858661998	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.478690787507	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.612485761084	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.600173519938	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.567084117366	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.454031860635	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.538880708278	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.425646430835	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.514331985808	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.298219142188	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.530804689578	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.339420167285	We actually did it.
0.0	0.505611320931	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.303076125159	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.369392493494	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.240561413302	That is...
0.0	0.338493845701	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.568184767232	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.632289328928	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.55099606722	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.328301926095	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.409058841036	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.570272136278	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.309698116861	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.613659622345	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.482127742909	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.324251790528	And we will be strong again.
1.0	0.508092674063	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.34594379144	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.639831762302	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.534373671493	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.648863572975	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.273697570546	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.633495951723	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.316952686154	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.504692563008	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.594390622844	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.447582942125	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.641806596466	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.615581439485	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.293455659553	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.603203105668	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.353992333955	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.592869190199	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.527988650933	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.489133204549	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
1.0	0.585955197549	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.673471970137	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.352909614205	We're not doing it.
1.0	0.476074209807	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.584465197587	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.630328716291	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.510748951651	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.680426804953	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.627168391695	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.620032452975	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.537784800697	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.677593838877	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.625147495799	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.38732436889	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.569805978154	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.314488894131	That's for sure.
0.0	0.615233109196	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.377639889398	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.543574375805	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.535829912185	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.380352303188	They're off to China.
0.0	0.35519040284	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.445203237873	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.436855586329	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.397478926229	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.304471604022	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.337009092073	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.368699019419	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.305251920303	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.583370594855	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.522400965361	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.443814873995	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.262712198249	That never works.
0.0	0.410961567344	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.568609537082	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.496893414747	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.302891925536	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.483420621705	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.634845172667	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.635889721137	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.415307876438	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.567740031576	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.319346650345	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.438278102861	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.540990500065	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.340673489697	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.37954845958	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.44352451342	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.348015697605	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.336832633742	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.466450929675	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.462762794057	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.531693162385	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
1.0	0.532961986908	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.639722921618	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.553584358674	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.55487612057	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.632929857206	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.52105571006	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.560187417605	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.62500690528	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.627323726876	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.511839956303	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.5233568908	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.631993577227	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.519962505262	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.329725716994	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.440785960539	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.619182990142	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.522367665208	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.478170910761	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.579874543371	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.533783509505	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.57132741306	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.484825321468	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.584480468925	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.44192096466	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.440122441325	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.249829839811	Bipartisan issue.
1.0	0.705041085539	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.501897232788	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.578437285	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.473837810549	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.397687312463	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.280646806275	Think about it.
0.0	0.36969036606	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.53159839931	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.564672225008	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.468320335561	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.530016702479	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.44092494009	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.551814069914	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.584363673766	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.274634524632	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.323994237332	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.531271484862	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.374341748256	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.467920246478	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.475427000267	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.540957175656	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.35002029388	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.488700782878	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.459188315919	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.683720601473	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.463867591564	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.618613927105	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
1.0	0.448983848545	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.610294704097	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.633858544622	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.408018313916	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.538451961143	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.64058318987	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.577768096334	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.420163717549	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.738566517511	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.695495981156	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.655216804256	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.402929331341	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.549982197902	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.660988584023	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.391805114967	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.607791719774	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.398583796442	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.651631613336	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.521695101888	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.483098475011	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.513538733175	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.469733017885	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.332489257926	You know why three?
0.0	0.499492055552	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.339037550635	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.647535451847	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.288590737742	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.616512450674	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.43338017936	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.513017336799	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.373700337217	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.619849711284	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.265506999379	It's true.
0.0	0.340127328716	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.48363535055	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.282752900397	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.48178867178	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.497917541413	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.350763935766	That's what he is.
1.0	0.441743419959	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.464045573696	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.400832507844	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.644800594122	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.21917559073	But...
0.0	0.648120011278	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.486475149914	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.595484758795	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.607710380871	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.479185860677	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.308705426209	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.529121827009	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.515360351246	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.27309079908	What should we do?
0.0	0.455820440235	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.593601647589	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.497348860351	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.62905524003	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.381975553283	And, we said no.
1.0	0.732777064021	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.363381431312	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.501026627427	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
1.0	0.631844045462	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.623957720659	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.554283237302	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.515510819907	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.590100055302	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.533894694362	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.290379633743	But I would add this.
0.0	0.32883292867	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.399404584408	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.421463181608	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.39756593635	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.286683003557	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.426588382623	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.216134008661	No.
1.0	0.766121899976	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
1.0	0.438140537755	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.591104857825	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.537342266418	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.34725396128	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.673007156373	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.283363377765	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.676807758829	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
1.0	0.656100745212	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.525334874933	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.418654442832	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.288756804358	It goes away.
0.0	0.298011485529	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.546207843342	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.441403141167	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.316537081438	And you know what?
0.0	0.643699464756	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.538056484859	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.610648012594	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.565749160455	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.535037099548	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.397289617076	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.414148977735	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.242208670659	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.585586403343	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.521694845502	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.648512757453	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.344125249754	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.388757506848	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.532173588473	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.314666016658	... on Larry Tribe.
1.0	0.510426556425	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.28489011822	I would change them.
0.0	0.535779397782	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.454448190432	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.638948153577	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.422995523242	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.281099073414	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.532401556846	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.309374268116	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.65929472334	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.

0.0	0.552438090374	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.491344249888	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.640562400702	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.561513599499	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.491097609824	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.462288970877	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.52157410228	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.442798680664	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.440655673503	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.482745285492	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.459432013393	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.435864449879	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
1.0	0.522904310904	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.460398786098	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.323465437693	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.434414937514	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.456026505666	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.305037690939	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.57611895222	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.462807884716	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.547279397139	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.407568536283	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.666757668946	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.521302045161	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.495071899071	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.50152832802	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.408582707542	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.559631369298	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.553306127774	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.543250323758	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
1.0	0.572028762573	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.53462862007	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.524869057876	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.427182585385	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.606825955855	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.503157963911	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.470464441488	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.308907385496	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.29102302541	And God bless America.
0.0	0.380683998515	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.593450973943	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.346707676402	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.47939072449	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.477908265267	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.26414333649	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.56130545438	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.638075172819	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.653163801432	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.273235075727	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.70684802246	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.347198364442	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.695650001999	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.560196846841	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.472180833207	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.370135861932	And we are not England.
0.0	0.404494622732	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.506782945055	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.564091039043	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.382503506247	But I was born here.
1.0	0.45802734738	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.293238398729	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.349941719972	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.320811340397	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.497614836765	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
1.0	0.666166084764	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.505431347241	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.474595961915	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.501265632129	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.530385015795	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.316537081438	And you know what?
0.0	0.31320899934	He has never defended...
0.0	0.368757902533	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.357751501092	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.515013546216	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.500765074429	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.633361929588	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.587683673965	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.602868160092	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.578951293772	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.610346158403	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.484858083202	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.512639526117	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.486704914946	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.64017999714	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.66634075713	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.316572449948	I think you're --
0.0	0.33213630472	So I'm doing great.
1.0	0.682543542808	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.499310274198	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.470230784265	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.367220178591	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.635276617618	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.642209293802	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.515065430152	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.501517255591	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.587735729961	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.521004868633	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.508573742995	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.361607894951	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.426531144549	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.592319635419	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.572534079112	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.580703434038	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.526468626739	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.439147428438	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.458968543037	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.497300546676	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.515676506947	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.539840807542	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.489324056804	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.4741127392	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.388658630196	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.306984668949	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.640500821049	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.637980913006	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.51346843521	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.616162923542	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.224765210602	slot.
0.0	0.537349915749	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.308355024436	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.558173209362	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.450514196524	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.497782867212	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.52627763149	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.47276160964	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.339250828173	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.655914641647	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.335107867044	In addition to that...
0.0	0.703146254869	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.369335974724	I never said that.
0.0	0.290721970568	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.430806688422	You know, I won two record elections.
1.0	0.632523742212	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.279427638217	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.511765573317	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.313821773204	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.585628940924	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.559598972619	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.395621331709	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.380806532138	She voted for it.
0.0	0.362979947269	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.395527245166	Here is where we are with public education.
1.0	0.617646145455	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.285194110906	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.670692412809	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.473105328106	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.676515716339	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.490374570979	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.636495434766	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.540498710787	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.38088119111	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.504951206906	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.390333948197	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.592546744425	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.505869745853	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.615808608546	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.358458340869	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.646180956232	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.461366524717	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.526518230226	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.622134875027	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.489341100404	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.499437778033	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.561414825081	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.464408804715	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.456699975749	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.49282319281	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.532318800537	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.478324208174	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.616018508431	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.0	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.258426886687	We were wrong.
0.0	0.536385761098	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.525057117017	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.279769478513	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.535493312582	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.490326379384	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
1.0	0.652213381595	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.601724975545	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.658301667441	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.503144322885	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.518514148891	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.62811543998	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.252278493804	And guess what?
0.0	0.520590131154	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.446973367405	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.653599585507	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.483861180862	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.465177449503	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.368840745924	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.443225008425	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.582012678714	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.461110013799	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
1.0	0.683171417168	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.639934281962	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?

0.0	0.377066303108	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.517869790573	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.0	Okay.
0.0	0.306201839364	I can do that.
0.0	0.548387885281	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.328518573819	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.582814891568	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.415532918618	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.648302472336	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.

0.0	0.304745929355	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.628406751899	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.400628360116	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.322283102752	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.421809640699	Well, a couple of things.
1.0	0.614557690868	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.576568785678	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.378080950366	Just for the record.
0.0	0.361599812365	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.436995935206	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.564800446995	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.437702459944	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.518887798435	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.530695408157	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.560137961574	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.537701984219	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.558401577646	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.622679413385	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.457298895164	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.471110506767	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.453495353568	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.436285149382	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.587367917308	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.462406374223	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.44261144388	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.297120390853	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.315666305527	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.394846399579	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.512485161774	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.428333192575	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.575713424793	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.489419458767	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.389200465674	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.516339959648	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.576922921214	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.391573668404	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.459701138718	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.501288278141	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
1.0	0.553165036242	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.546871136463	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.589949425255	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.407199022488	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.500880882017	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.310266067427	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.475549082521	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.435733853081	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.554715099092	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.572237479364	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.353689484545	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.486842987128	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.438605330407	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.375971949278	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.56087927635	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.530636893359	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.595110950912	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.275109123845	My point is this.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.424792507641	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.512226759216	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.316304907563	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.532378564471	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.541107806147	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.39178109538	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.338202208642	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.42907007054	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.48140600335	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.577425288972	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.635092079331	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.539806667978	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.579245769656	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.605853179369	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.495211921937	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
1.0	0.429469428548	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.548535396686	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.470566427939	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.460455765507	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.627841122357	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.648179422632	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
1.0	0.555837421563	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.616977109224	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.568203631787	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.656938946869	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.652870004767	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.587085794527	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.58207015676	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.484420706477	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.617197014334	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.452855863695	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.53207714298	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.252808568637	About Medicare?
0.0	0.614845312706	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.681859854743	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.619312936181	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.287533145672	Think about that.
0.0	0.649198491939	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.603376174179	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.410285397448	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.632493645735	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
1.0	0.572513055004	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.398301286508	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.564438185056	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.303644417654	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.351322250733	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.250675576761	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.529104364665	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.346413352597	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.431512032083	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.4475208054	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.449623043568	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
1.0	0.584181766222	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.643774845265	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.332701958428	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.655298204795	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.629443937386	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.644207409557	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.262133881877	They were wrong.
0.0	0.461952651003	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.48294405924	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.591724250453	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.317608619506	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.458843761602	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.565354339365	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.349046746459	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.462088538921	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.611592465229	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.472430531293	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.586802111359	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
