0.0	0.256993537558	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.387252576401	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.674475615032	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.458380818954	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.59665030616	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
1.0	0.659565877928	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.608684051193	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.66824937811	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.528814055435	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.385840131378	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.265286930607	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.402691037835	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.279561406262	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.852803681274	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.792230500526	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.321778828024	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.588265264188	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.672565245543	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.742249806101	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.355894535698	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.0	Alright.
0.0	0.265280749423	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.331962034483	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.542132145873	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.46521188532	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.875208652265	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.132734795684	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.666529255134	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.548223740062	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.223219601513	He does great.
0.0	0.595800342734	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.327540026777	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.661690348993	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.0604914761157	I'll say this.
1.0	0.275514191215	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.331252704409	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.466452832374	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.325541030384	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.871880947892	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.40996532647	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.530687997774	I never said that.
0.0	0.525071864673	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.274425601328	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.196825184667	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.396910913104	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.532659982303	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.603583652601	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.572084739148	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.386630366293	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.32715325206	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.270054035311	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.302080581954	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.330913085795	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.598090629469	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.0649495766746	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.602868496759	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.598016536653	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.538088154329	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
1.0	0.661255307419	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.397945873217	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.331898650467	That's not true.
0.0	0.266664382596	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.256592316576	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.26032206394	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.331566615264	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.529631898221	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.529446016566	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.330280347463	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	1.0	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.480354082148	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.483234626589	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.262583365024	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.659780331935	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.197839148948	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.546059666917	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.731148786228	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.465643593169	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.0632922267934	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.402045798919	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.479807730055	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.319741490619	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
1.0	0.787018181846	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.867406286678	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.614692753304	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.128388371594	This will end.
0.0	0.740495617013	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.798169978487	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.667639845392	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.

0.0	0.475628730568	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.212162432089	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.212910446279	That's good.
0.0	0.39602364003	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.

0.0	0.617155029881	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.655740555462	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.588355124532	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.478901069717	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.

0.0	0.793592017809	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.790019157941	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.230117335152	And you know what?
0.0	0.41445852927	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.530816719753	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.865038525512	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.

0.0	0.395640699611	How great is that?
0.0	0.129887527862	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.537521159855	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.203495477645	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
1.0	0.124435266612	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	1.0	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.263862831289	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.601938650424	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.473945698648	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.445796134087	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.597493287879	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.529530629064	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.594587687492	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.538323655545	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.0	I hope you'll reconsider.

0.0	0.0	You did.
0.0	0.270414058176	No, it's true.
0.0	0.526053996837	That is our government today.
0.0	0.416068761257	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.532943668623	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.594700187614	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.604130981908	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.460061489105	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.754627031236	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.472771837315	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.398748328561	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.737122770814	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.

0.0	0.532925471015	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.609378011823	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.588219589385	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.532588315783	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.59946317827	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.407570467992	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...

0.0	0.612721429861	Enough on fantasy football.

0.0	0.317160302749	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.128499167904	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.467406809225	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.320595065072	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.329869900166	It's a joke.
0.0	0.329511275954	That's my view.
0.0	0.453121415641	You know why three?
0.0	0.0585786437627	Say again?
0.0	0.22793154935	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.336572165761	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.727010467992	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.455765669289	Wait for what?
0.0	0.299911160812	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.526589449548	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.522471357595	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.531519696926	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.598619159983	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.19436681379	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.524725674325	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.598879500253	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.252638188867	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.259851404269	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.26160590413	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.528253915927	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.454887141065	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.119930538677	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.0704732466585	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.601256217205	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.0726044098538	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.808356205523	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.536165012673	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.453644169513	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.124241911978	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.598042195265	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.591664976033	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.599848169253	He was on the board.
0.0	0.260577175939	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.324828752919	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.593788255588	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.610666188993	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.125986478915	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.281417480503	We need security.
0.0	0.259818680498	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.538196361832	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.803359623581	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.0	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.506265059368	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.663836811988	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.526328216545	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.535791748169	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.60661046513	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.719577867814	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.66321015952	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.321274349563	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.465667462611	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.476798496741	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.671363394999	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.461311543072	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.419269712145	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.519218090248	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.230117335152	But you know what?
0.0	0.460400978855	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.674966301242	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.534862226187	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.263484722142	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.395324541206	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.649321981846	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.379444458536	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.200945355731	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.533164934429	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.467834432693	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.471649718126	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.469231851814	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.721460929063	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.0607510195821	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.384777412517	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
1.0	0.674383381536	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.140923473531	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.609015663395	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.336062783129	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.80928067635	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.733454604891	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.668071163969	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.273056844534	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.184636861754	I would just say that...
0.0	0.38061789743	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.469710602086	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
1.0	0.544303666853	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.391833231135	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.465563913061	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.541158858578	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.135696511768	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.6073005911	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.0605553052024	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.256835234618	Our next president...
0.0	0.397121030275	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.327296264809	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.470229134434	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.539326380491	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.346440051191	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.403067707992	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.559496323858	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.602759180811	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.743368247847	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.547469590309	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.540011189186	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.396032425496	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.204410224091	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.73202353948	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.614161690555	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.606092508334	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.52866586134	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.272383221151	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.39051177	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.338706618538	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.475751229298	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.565934963194	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.322163028956	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.52672285589	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.609470584278	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.207013287965	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.462007506435	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.346406245711	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.636468227059	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.461997042108	Divisive and with no vision.
1.0	0.596967841402	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.525856637404	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.539084995455	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.0	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.785282204536	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.331765836851	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.463101122019	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.549347243501	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.319372272475	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	1.0	You get together.
0.0	0.461408457759	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.300137629498	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.478650233635	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.526058244184	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.134419544639	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.547389028331	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.287743695605	You have to lead.
0.0	0.52776182342	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.314176239759	That has not been...
0.0	0.930227166691	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.270964466777	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.391743539726	I know every one.
1.0	0.594376433569	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.549150484408	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.390482371189	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.263649009914	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.137855305256	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.475102826841	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.0634533007798	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
1.0	0.680034973297	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.668146815343	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.455103890666	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.871828057924	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.402570082246	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.937266211079	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.212102032868	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.188366198552	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.597948628217	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.26287203585	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.384356106816	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.607481800948	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.477428163396	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.478360712954	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.538004725105	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.332478964428	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.129360344718	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.531247687722	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.478842410188	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.73680955453	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.0	Dynamically.
1.0	0.334947331027	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.532164362423	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.347237893771	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.599970281285	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.803356024881	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.473363030966	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.257452612067	...No, sir...
0.0	0.25690887663	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.65693549127	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.676247780964	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.395299906741	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
1.0	0.801054589338	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.592772691463	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.530894183697	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
1.0	0.597642740627	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.681481499342	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.391923684002	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.248170110344	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.867847386781	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.531090026634	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.750958422509	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.386977765816	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
1.0	0.531145315064	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.678222235883	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.452492594702	He hit oil.
0.0	0.464741492054	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.335868534727	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.719799731159	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.865083072392	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.327536652314	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.131570628325	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.0	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.0	Big difference.
0.0	0.474665150786	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.401741610712	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.80422946955	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.393706688765	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.457659693941	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.527906178382	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.386716187272	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.745131524062	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.258731758305	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.795977109724	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.748885977899	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.53572345872	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.392267549821	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.343148152702	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.495109448852	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.486211157386	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.471873804437	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.135613555018	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.191677744058	We need sound money.
0.0	0.470117628182	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.53213896405	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.54492378541	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.187870760018	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.737423576871	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.46265158038	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.389645041216	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.798016174773	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.542273964037	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.530491851474	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.658542992325	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.612120151254	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.802632699055	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.19079027535	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.538152508612	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.339602932449	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.812576176588	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.595892498459	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.460826051539	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.670331300117	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.264487219756	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.596382731787	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.523603539415	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.466381734487	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.19874383629	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.406126689281	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.532058858501	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.544720344537	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.237544062252	I like it.
0.0	0.195737633973	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.611226751789	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.603812731149	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.405157615942	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.745754866364	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.448102698902	Well, I did.
0.0	0.329344034196	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.263706054195	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.550741460834	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.659133681665	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.527649722793	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.125477007327	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.378805698702	I got that.
0.0	0.12863799889	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.465549973853	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.405333507084	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.406661459661	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.664687338286	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.147122352284	I win.
0.0	0.125641550932	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.195297355347	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.592399129903	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.187107903645	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.19386679227	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.72322798554	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.387569957626	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.537889150716	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.263070471465	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.385841412143	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.605000354249	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.531172286784	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.339988018546	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.575127450225	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.736706643188	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.338671919507	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.384331262926	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.46847080801	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.416331005661	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.39840560828	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
1.0	0.416582308825	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.463750426012	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.447103709683	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.133890117792	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.54531570371	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.526286801965	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.412058747413	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.198866819952	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.460197551429	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.536407549235	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.739729104247	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.27305393586	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.796596691635	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.661698628891	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.472439973573	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.391717510915	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
1.0	0.55518017688	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.665669696725	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.265400389426	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.362361174571	We're running.
0.0	0.598010356091	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.39692738022	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.196512518487	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.597780560088	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.463188676058	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.538960600992	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.542624668345	We are not France.
0.0	0.607025936515	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.681803982357	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.279155757014	This country is changing.
0.0	0.660832459641	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.563418944463	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.446055580011	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.801010823626	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.262035265668	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.675892334709	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.248493341748	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.593938900899	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.457162211689	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.541539711608	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.3712742451	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.541815255105	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.669361085751	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.670646607678	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.452215856723	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.674966301242	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.470224207848	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.198218341411	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.672470017266	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.599800761282	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.580076819121	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.576133203367	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
1.0	0.869785968813	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.739824348502	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.438903022153	This is a business flat tax.
1.0	0.3442056728	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.598274157668	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.684941249066	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.399128411182	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.0628984122599	No -- no...
0.0	0.653095006016	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.649760644663	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.330094761487	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.53974772756	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.536186648658	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.747912817246	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.331744911827	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.553083218756	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.674415713511	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.677164674282	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.0679599427654	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.592836624014	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.530870239902	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.466054975094	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.587844175583	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.634530335066	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.392210734308	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.0604914761157	I will do that.
0.0	0.0649985285322	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.678541196467	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.464244077638	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.602301531551	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.277539735305	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.605830367554	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.335031895011	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.396307855101	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.132457936527	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.131032736559	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.526758981129	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.645042310805	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.730200599751	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.128846270816	That's the difference.
0.0	0.384410914208	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.396305949476	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.585221412657	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.733960271024	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.269389534276	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.664048455685	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.388087498034	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.335808264914	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.323187040068	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.602927018366	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.134773130504	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.600044803277	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.305843179569	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.398845518034	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.279954829155	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.542822475494	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.319496512458	And so do I.
0.0	0.743291036461	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.123929774908	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.745533335979	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.599101874378	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.133527909224	No, John.
0.0	0.392872649402	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.468302133298	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.654178350057	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.269611911695	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.591538180445	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.674790909003	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.319550565158	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.384288089561	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.258987864081	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.462283413726	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.0761004258212	How do I know this?
0.0	0.732549636454	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.334439467339	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.281124703802	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
1.0	0.39930288882	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.413318912726	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.457121151359	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.605636965164	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.601277053723	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.673606277324	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.286316753304	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.40414522813	The number of women --
0.0	0.80902585244	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.460680188836	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.331311739464	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.483971173647	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.519434671102	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.469975614015	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.132943541733	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.38417155741	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.514528822932	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.865365100247	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.0	...
1.0	0.866767239079	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.548865963529	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.449500822228	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.427837581207	Is there an area for a safety net?
1.0	0.79144790639	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.540107125409	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.0	Why?
0.0	0.475185208316	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.730172258648	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.534562767043	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.576769440489	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.270131172549	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
1.0	0.331609509224	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.0665253883113	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.461490435892	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.521749208429	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.471497494069	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.592432701406	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.536079021793	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.40214477995	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.675214507993	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.458472846922	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.597530342824	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.397911038873	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.463508525964	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.347312830121	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.738100212485	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.265097571075	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.404457411158	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.599692000933	And loose money is one of the major problems.
1.0	0.730183506556	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.396722415777	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.455106859309	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
1.0	0.797726973441	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.547080191599	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.528157821283	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.556996903755	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.534275289055	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.607681048208	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.532506290128	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.602425546231	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.593776843801	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.44933472422	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.528538772402	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.263505167717	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.797289742124	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.248071116479	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.610368847807	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.806387263949	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.259485224919	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.407801687214	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.326825586262	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.207593720924	We have to obey the laws.
1.0	0.668663655305	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.463382405845	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.462057379619	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.332793186265	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.681314681722	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.314611871457	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.598141333287	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.738387805888	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.127454522556	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.402069731228	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.453092702445	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.721515437565	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.126159788455	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.464156184286	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.373101555883	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.527523815368	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.270303229978	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.266298682958	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.400875249526	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.13177044468	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.532045475612	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.127781824297	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.192251686892	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.333723297721	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.711423690757	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.738493931711	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.339787415884	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.141563838151	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.54054583558	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.804163846957	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.517833546593	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.337731314696	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.261082042552	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.546405115321	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	1.0	You're right.
0.0	0.224603051473	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.929648173344	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.799559362082	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.0727277450604	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.323716612193	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.191341425217	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.329781335274	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.65911105014	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.0	These...
0.0	0.588383681808	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.194243664539	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.538384915394	You looking at me?
0.0	0.600714414631	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.128156799601	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.320516044948	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.534145444858	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.197882037655	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.730115789422	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.249370761781	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.706125198217	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.257746567567	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.396748934859	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.805320080672	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.458793394539	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.550397735014	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.515583438076	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.328000884782	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.651072016407	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.608910477263	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.55361143447	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.256935775928	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.393886209317	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.604793416912	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.668241052388	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.612053892206	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.382997939453	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.348168902372	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.80547466538	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.670366941282	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.411514812917	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.209471883805	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
1.0	0.472718623962	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.

0.0	0.456646253099	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.330392432782	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.644939196984	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.396426159036	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.72297339547	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.36038478001	You do legislation.

0.0	0.741382184625	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.472286916206	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.325923922967	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.659874860578	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.532571922673	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.333733358588	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.131140430273	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.659714463758	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.

0.0	0.32680785608	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.202226586826	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.875755147205	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.268248861352	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.675423818912	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.132494489895	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.0	It is.
0.0	0.543149484224	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.406164768388	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.734568083147	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.68458904944	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.402359600907	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.534336799244	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.725149059403	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
1.0	0.526173226576	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.403885319656	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.265893385464	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.347221997528	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.344199304731	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.0671163911615	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.695085405732	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.13783084397	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.525296455165	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.463526348453	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.267873226249	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.40877307108	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.465391741777	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.656253149544	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.0	...John...
0.0	0.512051127132	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.674707728046	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.465984489925	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
1.0	0.807560378538	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.200324417557	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	1.0	Of course not.
0.0	0.250674545731	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.351898185094	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.675388778444	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.405404371336	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.400988830992	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.7374017962	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.592441395473	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.665496900764	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.152168326388	You do.
0.0	0.392656754716	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.330370937404	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.0	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.584721990809	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.534359322399	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.603240082587	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.197207585079	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.0	See?
0.0	0.52873751493	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.515489475945	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.407738521094	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.460196945762	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.360035416656	I'm ready.
0.0	0.535508397649	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.137010031607	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.467193453166	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.198974293455	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.395736595947	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.122045295285	...Thank you.
0.0	0.334114112923	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.3879290064	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.395825576654	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.591791308634	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.124743944686	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.256498789086	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.533568802414	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.599229979199	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.682956066906	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.732972653462	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.468193053705	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.812512900181	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.404964887069	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
1.0	0.461162380732	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.471484139051	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.261701944161	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.452176106907	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.537603857022	We lose on trade.
1.0	0.738509937586	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.546689846299	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.401714109156	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.324982850394	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.332330860312	Run the company kids, have a good time.
1.0	0.602086000609	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.126542130142	Check it out.
0.0	0.132872789105	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.413832290145	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.530692743208	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.32778543857	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.17729614536	We can't do it.
0.0	0.207399596321	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.457357661771	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.322162138088	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.743511828285	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.740750294039	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.259274692532	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.251068109014	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.599763821508	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.399531946538	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.461831640899	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.594691661841	...before I go.
0.0	0.72426849746	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.387641116707	So you might not.
0.0	0.328880502003	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.454242281072	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.805210011666	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.198885416432	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.533689113035	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.208419234284	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.604845188307	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.573505029686	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.460247954685	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.59492350729	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.207508714239	I would change them.
0.0	0.461789745321	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.602204936007	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.292246475846	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.466205635186	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.600026140922	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.459838108366	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.412835288055	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.440775493721	I said no.
0.0	0.211620608322	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.447865480092	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.39692144767	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.328618538531	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.131183574825	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.258333909783	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.402652426192	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.374599132685	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.400748762893	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.38907500531	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.402077333884	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.65767885147	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.329134584605	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.198614158352	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.463960561909	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.465953065403	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.396503159953	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.409735511972	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.544404422818	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.526681088722	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.141366949067	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.261431074583	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
1.0	0.809115575831	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.528212779981	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.538239737548	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.527698921476	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.467502267163	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.792784085548	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.740666483583	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
1.0	0.724450135881	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.135100474018	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.540339348737	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.13449477737	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.550769778177	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.339809796365	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.468553930309	I have no idea.
0.0	0.483572874451	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.560191454695	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.320467741053	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.271880924245	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.269986210127	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.864313859599	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.474796213727	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.335117222697	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.27832142907	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.677054034837	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.262247594163	Now, we're going to blame the people.
1.0	0.78520942462	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.611637825657	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.26995209361	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.330440174887	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.600005781142	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.151402938836	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.607939068306	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.19651393109	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.265116573306	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.199897916574	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.863773710517	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.418249768197	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.478689622053	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.464125433335	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.246330831219	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.0707790559032	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.321274201996	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.653880968138	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.0	Neil...
0.0	0.655382991253	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.475614336402	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.402332746854	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.135053218148	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.661474108683	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.398944911803	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.340379618685	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.400564541008	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.329821107567	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.585362495514	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
1.0	0.813731028662	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.17729614536	I can't do it.
0.0	0.536000498583	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.136094485894	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.481944537343	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
1.0	0.584547220945	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.533880684385	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.533658282356	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.451292881235	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.267811633915	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.325951998721	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.60814842171	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.681828928717	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.4656287359	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.681932358156	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.435931490088	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.4812878332	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.370633591017	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.878933070821	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.280024983281	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.744862343272	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.732787055614	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.202047858351	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.663455485324	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.321378110852	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.388615226828	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.332267568388	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.465509303111	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.405881593674	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.66611259354	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.466039446854	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.204415521239	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
1.0	0.126893913031	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.460554119566	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.604315356349	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.730134390967	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.467617719762	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.511426841206	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.337445053532	That is not right.
0.0	0.53775556062	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.527238207581	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.600835619528	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.462892518026	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.264758874702	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.135400962716	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.60116126484	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.462599950528	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.60045132027	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.651137415996	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.270308156135	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.0	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.265007162317	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.327210651541	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.27127275687	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.548586008646	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.259055327704	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.607179771047	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.866637755126	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.932691571777	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.200270280346	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.536071699536	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.524637139765	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.600047966359	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.266811356501	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.191862116103	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.80462693837	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.389816617151	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.459352037317	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.196650926985	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.443426133583	They're a scam.
0.0	0.529484744213	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
1.0	0.34154243415	They were wrong.
0.0	0.464424488482	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.527616105728	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.538816950708	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.651730130494	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.328577887033	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.261729529435	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.728633957601	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.455456351187	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.266522079285	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.207664014262	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.129392204393	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.286110877387	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.183342274051	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.80696351922	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.340816696174	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.525282477889	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
1.0	0.79436890485	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.282135597651	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.5825723396	No, you did.
0.0	0.53812821791	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.459987970795	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.0	I don't care.
0.0	0.731487019525	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.517496115927	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.525733656949	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.335544218014	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.267362683753	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.276776866037	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.595339728907	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.726893251037	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.192925158157	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.551788538795	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.208226635487	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.533558546052	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.741211109306	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.27572502208	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.327924645701	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.514566407239	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.671485770244	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.67479982643	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.781451583146	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.744934072593	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.332860937289	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.329997344404	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.535536029872	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.591783388584	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.546466178637	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.325985244222	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.341304861463	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.400513988941	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.337445053532	That's not right.
0.0	0.207632072564	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.207629790088	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.260600299066	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.402039135014	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.195877197457	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.459115362794	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.802431960707	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.399879166938	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.531160021652	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.332351118715	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.807714045906	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.263111856262	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.189589102455	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.673397404687	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.265051178598	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.677454355585	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.610614746691	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.263351746974	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.409909088646	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.597673226584	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
1.0	0.277027232947	Very few children.
1.0	0.544798425262	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.60220800666	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.343861191963	No vision at all.
0.0	0.596297734067	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.540012578851	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.603162775162	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.0	Creativity.
0.0	0.744230724482	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.524059523024	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.465573907317	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.64925512994	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.270387739406	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.659896676109	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.472686508357	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.250725122343	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.333617039271	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.205388963736	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.333386181672	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.654250171716	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.313698727281	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.124625304682	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
1.0	0.739111864967	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.192412110595	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.535885973094	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
1.0	0.261027979739	That's wrong.
0.0	0.311605421791	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.605223103654	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.261733989485	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	1.0	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.406063737894	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.193721179369	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.794737278839	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.337848898252	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --

0.0	0.253428392056	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.545429587534	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.406965794888	This would be devastating for the economy.
1.0	0.598719764497	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.391633256787	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.54468236381	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.328143571234	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.348020972858	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.608788113259	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.331252704409	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.681184881899	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.52666656041	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.39407106391	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.399049677525	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.669034567378	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.924651936051	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.336252695285	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.802373245707	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.129761106794	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.527342665369	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.73590524798	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.267365113792	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.559392345028	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.44933472422	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.467097387257	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.652293325535	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.320323169872	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.466452225658	That's my bill.
0.0	0.738822237275	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.198280572332	OK, good.
0.0	0.142603882101	They know.
0.0	0.601239065717	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.713569011798	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.556680929996	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.0	...Chris...
0.0	0.193993897543	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.524516568752	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.611487124162	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.399950430764	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.78247481264	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.396084907774	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.282048914358	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.377622582486	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.662368986185	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.675719119161	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.800996969356	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.20347909618	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.389990981582	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.933388506952	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.13973451313	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.522611297356	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.362361174571	We're running.
0.0	0.666098348969	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.720066937663	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.468634741101	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.532126788792	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.733969437277	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.400229232967	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.26459006036	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.738484111249	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.521678919481	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.400584810605	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.524836229337	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.32776011876	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.0723465871236	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.738640883825	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.533470810357	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.125006970811	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.539523386872	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.727126171182	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.463779740977	That's what I said.
0.0	0.524910923279	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.335484763706	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.66804941216	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.664201084069	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.726689885972	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.130356929979	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.456979737364	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.259242819811	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.716943159994	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.593690789096	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.670710996938	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.25478013969	I want to talk to the folks at home.
1.0	0.803987021684	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.274775907791	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.0	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.310440771868	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.264094382902	He's wrong.
0.0	0.47595541994	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.530305879947	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.544842775823	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.192559659744	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.474917002527	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.19683241692	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
1.0	0.601547766868	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.125254494771	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.540050770066	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.461081858567	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.144529997278	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.472169866702	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.212102032868	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.53962276706	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.468360057642	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.198597952568	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.64596276352	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.191345835333	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.347413358303	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.538797709101	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.731096381733	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.655289938943	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.541258527566	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.342590759291	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.66316831104	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.392593003971	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.261692758768	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.321388167188	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.476373220322	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.386518189196	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.196457562233	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.464067080883	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.260057432887	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.272063549937	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.724643315252	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.0702260234938	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.657603116246	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.537821742269	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.331016655824	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.267512002391	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.0609155751001	I will not do that.
0.0	0.0	Ever.
1.0	0.392727126734	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.340848173038	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.464139366095	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.572558898557	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.524293611509	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.199474992365	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.260229133484	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.0658268911761	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.396812366176	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.26582796416	to save a company.
0.0	0.61046653435	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.210761393629	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.466376502195	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.802748298817	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.387116860098	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.680457269438	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.728768069026	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.420939414661	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.673593358763	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.474159062588	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.468073570983	My background is different.
0.0	0.80362984989	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.504375869551	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.270799467166	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.597361722544	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.381211587883	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.524779940302	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.0633328306543	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.648555918558	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.477619634647	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.245382911928	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.473563568261	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.597438840959	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.650764193446	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.587233269103	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.391692018862	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.199097299716	It feels different.
0.0	0.74184831174	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.30878603116	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.590881210657	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.60071847711	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.0596451849592	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.59550901427	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.867735684148	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.335431764455	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.599636369162	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.72611712232	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.508649546832	I changed that.
0.0	0.534865684122	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.674363093339	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.268908416112	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.337505332491	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.925362779686	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.544119430835	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.60016581571	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.598262798208	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.326259248477	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.670249758961	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.134051971908	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.273907971225	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.189605209853	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.662121393617	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.457691666284	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
1.0	0.538203201262	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.398170342893	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.598182212976	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."

0.0	0.65887565209	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
1.0	0.398625338094	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.

0.0	0.672296851489	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.741465974693	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.663341076732	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
1.0	0.668272161044	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.

0.0	0.664080873845	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.597608658978	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.586984591935	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.601540874118	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.531051401232	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.520733561368	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.804202682641	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.407237066948	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.272102795789	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.

0.0	0.798815252911	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.259886822335	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.669019362252	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.476055677278	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.466959862025	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.474378555831	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.575315990758	What have you got now?
0.0	0.625279517923	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.65695692463	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.326731909545	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.597741895642	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.798597199813	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.

0.0	0.333430920863	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.683761630332	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.

0.0	0.395127305628	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.407361124622	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.265082250811	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.464819905973	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.460085240134	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.816105089819	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.392870683829	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.256939881502	And you know, he's right.
1.0	0.469065071757	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.530687997774	I never said that.
0.0	0.532514528013	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.197032606054	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.326608832317	Japan, the same thing.

0.0	0.87590406774	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.526350162042	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.40101260952	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.47888073432	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.798827831739	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.532379231957	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.389857140782	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.258113799885	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.537679163993	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.24979454285	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.330765148468	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.397302198582	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.202232957949	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.0	She was right.
0.0	0.60537623159	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.136532653564	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.458187603672	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.389466368988	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.671184633788	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.535561956623	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.653250417576	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.545172513871	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.264046311978	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.451603618733	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.383363972279	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.338951467038	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.474905770589	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.608598400987	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.661801423477	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.391283256728	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.595668657873	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.865341076552	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.665597582083	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.723072861223	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.0611045001712	I think he is right.
0.0	0.730903607326	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.0	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.390714550848	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.593144502297	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.604949875489	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.7335399859	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.198814534097	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.466706090004	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.550015475275	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.582611595081	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.538968296375	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.533227291326	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.27138372977	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.452966125938	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.511651177854	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.804158686679	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.470913623378	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.637618890028	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.594703721987	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.535714722986	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.663569864639	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.60117363953	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.499707859773	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.732447464152	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.599268710956	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.386312651276	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.265872852984	I want security.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.463517601511	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.331684480156	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.408038798104	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.59460374561	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.133242448369	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.256234671225	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.328236456367	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.854933206121	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.531772231758	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.0619692096886	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.191979589597	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.267431684754	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.196469058116	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.480001774777	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.260781134095	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.531375032879	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.393516853303	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.26785414661	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.454762715978	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.652496803055	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.179978413608	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.665532078646	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.468597374394	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.339422929173	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.147122352284	I promise.
0.0	0.191563361423	I understand.
0.0	0.543416171441	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.595796587725	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.530504203493	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.388861819498	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.0	It was.
0.0	0.331893696086	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.533368228504	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.33919257279	I've laid out...
0.0	0.268651472365	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.344491142194	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.72759869638	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.0653392044915	But look...
0.0	0.443426133583	They're a scam.
0.0	0.615412044874	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.52903540816	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.876805559901	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.533133332927	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.120352138025	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.134534711516	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.73928416866	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.127899694767	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.405620996783	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.415310804183	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.736269176322	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.39547456844	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.264693984599	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.0	White people?
0.0	0.205127223745	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.131960179529	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.201082524567	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.548715617012	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.532846433413	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.265919004369	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.198180457115	The answer is no.
0.0	0.508649700119	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.324441697835	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.408473030912	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.528449340749	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.465308812505	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.327241930235	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.658331118933	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
1.0	0.866583742395	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.539479440393	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.666222957914	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.546691113768	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.226205801631	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.859308111555	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.658286020478	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.2116459312	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.401885541389	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.539634724731	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.5404767724	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.61556135037	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.614123557465	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.208941734295	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.272176423888	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.332715758056	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.404512732349	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.197287789025	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.40411714028	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.393043866289	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.230117335152	And you know what?
0.0	0.5859710769	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
1.0	0.0647101579168	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
1.0	0.682991934907	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.588564743128	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.414939840812	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.594261274235	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.534476630262	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.506002089931	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.44726733239	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.604153731675	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.401302109801	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.457854025524	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.516703952755	And here's why.
0.0	0.532041809953	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.520789053647	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.526377415666	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.660385383579	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.405950148203	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.522389299908	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.579440300701	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.126542130142	Check it out.
0.0	0.582668675854	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.463344257035	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.338823455135	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.407540976233	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.593383396982	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.212011286436	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.129383195469	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.456148231633	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.677998253355	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.32008542984	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.0622587277943	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.403130885704	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.394687331437	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.601748140821	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.662924397948	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.0634391080529	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.40299949843	Why is that?
0.0	0.661670732586	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.342341047692	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.579067274874	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.467911171677	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.260216486067	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.338014879712	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.0	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.805378885862	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.383851441174	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.336862114751	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.808525230173	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.604719762609	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
1.0	0.523318547368	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.261922265668	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.126724262715	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.413552684946	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.331164829363	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.45624978386	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.262811137261	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
1.0	0.731268023866	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.603037168149	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.254136759614	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.19676736723	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.339368754586	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.201238981993	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.268337147549	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.66517279364	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.936585803912	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.332683727501	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.520683956266	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.453225535011	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.265935084934	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.389179696128	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.810585888878	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.268519760292	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.54079573951	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.336672153542	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.185756698816	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.390450449856	And for good cause.
0.0	0.529907580225	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.51494784391	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.26433996101	Came out great.
1.0	1.0	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.723585969362	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.660084114424	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.342218788826	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.606823304096	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.745621478733	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.260263290418	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.484752303702	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.660187065099	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.335237390731	How about this?
0.0	0.589742258832	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.19666949233	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.258203082001	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.805749884599	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.322763058355	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.672292791207	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.538421944387	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.323400863132	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.5412091132	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.203845407805	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.152168326388	I do.
0.0	0.249511287359	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.262038451968	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.613793828385	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.392767147985	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.599406788628	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.0	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.194723276386	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.400726444204	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.538206323216	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.460725882459	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.396627825487	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.330379578294	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.599787104912	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.474026310414	You count on it.
0.0	0.334937807462	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.673199763398	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.80287283204	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.33229691219	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.384902663486	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.598142203907	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.189923570476	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.554249310562	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.657106855768	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.603483182197	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.40824727637	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.258221706489	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.598242117719	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.58455264258	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.264652087184	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.6737684825	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.325847197836	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.457113387087	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.595084714353	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.576113853349	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.0608707607721	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.733839786772	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
1.0	0.804875959324	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.114069992175	You can have him.
0.0	0.736618378153	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.674409786271	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.269846345524	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
1.0	0.617289840613	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.807114943688	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
1.0	0.662908807039	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.126577391048	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.735995974773	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.392031375253	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.45831880582	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.53011578037	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.475965293386	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.0	Both served.
0.0	0.275597276445	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.53190051878	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.467955219242	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.473291612861	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.126755857694	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.462124440131	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.595172790544	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.333936327152	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.530067249016	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.594843194829	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.871782962451	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.403721975144	I mean, you know...
1.0	0.588532391647	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.463598230802	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.126656025564	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.196068283106	You just want to...
0.0	0.152168326388	I have.
0.0	0.798112865309	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.462330992284	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.270511239771	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.392836829926	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.33924853062	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.518686596254	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.399555472231	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.33434526345	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.190816340466	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.251788236694	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.252610657639	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.431768278018	We're friends.
0.0	0.0689871727052	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.19661952013	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.324210557767	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.192640009754	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.408295323006	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.6696910867	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.47095524358	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.328443257054	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.278351261824	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.392877843961	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.392977072916	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.533688939658	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.454536698793	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.314837972316	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.392357145707	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.200775881191	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.612479017475	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.60590545944	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.207186099972	You're welcome.
0.0	0.127727492481	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.245429175485	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.740692571159	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.460177167683	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.476360470783	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.26877795069	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.811843752887	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.532654630071	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.464114277233	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.13904785264	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.199621777044	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.134667190931	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.330355438788	It never happens.
0.0	0.7487176022	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.53203964655	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.597213847739	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.530445859533	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.144512214444	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.25205487624	Divide that out.
0.0	0.600050313796	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.525957085755	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.537930414127	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.408643100099	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.514476145744	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.391124881304	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.470670480033	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.727829663223	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.477530280975	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.735090010869	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.387671757271	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.47461863739	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.317348582869	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.719281062153	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.607231934499	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.255166691461	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.198684800823	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.605536201487	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.73108659512	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.330613038241	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.726133326801	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.407822415048	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.44457987093	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.585506094063	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.0630881067507	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.530297266199	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.534260856985	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.669959132699	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.469933577528	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.677713604179	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.614137075563	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.279249916796	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.598032623664	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.129724470475	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.744656832919	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.386770058044	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.264257786086	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.339912872517	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.332223784052	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.668882539163	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.935580915332	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.324885935978	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.278292507338	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.335868484984	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.535429563973	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.204872201306	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.0633671619139	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.261470899335	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.463902731475	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.676988878818	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.467614117674	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.666747172211	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.323507640348	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.250222026454	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.607363535737	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.337379444363	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.124217152052	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.482328048449	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.394739406734	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.608161091087	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.802499419339	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.262148831811	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.871823998934	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.421750205753	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
1.0	0.52668887143	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.273410930963	No their not.
0.0	0.802310008024	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.743742682655	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.45212479992	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.195670050851	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.410031688692	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.46228294296	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.749894381532	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.594607413695	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.609824013348	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.667468694176	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.736594668025	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.730589619521	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.403288290604	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.272739074045	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.462543150733	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.33920140295	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.205132533815	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.528804575345	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.376018652803	We actually did it.
0.0	0.472458458197	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.203623767014	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.197219227426	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.0612890510687	That is...
0.0	0.249759281988	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.604012884499	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.667768242768	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.41094163509	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.260750253566	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.617356811036	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.675357265454	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.119785541349	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.474881090725	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.466374878351	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.0631544260767	And we will be strong again.
1.0	0.674025985537	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.203235809258	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.785758187828	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.525837956325	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.739661797159	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.470015514761	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.585225939355	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.192798581059	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.408186136624	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.605954278257	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.395823795878	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.937801018358	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.671817356894	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.0582502988742	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.53441518288	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.325808657775	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.738834954511	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.320354424044	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.316575113784	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
1.0	0.59102779255	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.669894785396	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.453232885868	We're not doing it.
1.0	0.473335118343	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.47146182473	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.593931033067	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.601740145384	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.662435256266	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.672511032729	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.609798734495	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.663079566835	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.675073582569	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.536175350598	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.466407460904	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.684789494943	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.406879491759	That's for sure.
0.0	0.695602550425	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.599437177422	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.688425628141	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.532386891674	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.39725757454	They're off to China.
0.0	0.332520968299	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.52066193614	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.727321848614	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.464780953425	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.392767147985	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.0647551367389	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.264504674107	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.133331542614	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.677088179507	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.449592879312	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.451942906667	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.340549970476	That never works.
0.0	0.481380032774	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.605576089727	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.

0.0	0.676577196414	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.400470209587	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.661293079844	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.

0.0	0.680018447895	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.1270994051	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.144453869093	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.392793512098	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.064492134154	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.344038310665	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.266021142233	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.386964928074	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.40199328202	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
1.0	0.536943053915	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.551263658852	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.464037967516	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.478057525345	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.792476114206	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.261480277654	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.608450194064	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.732831650849	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.

0.0	0.465673003969	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.527700396369	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.392507824288	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.533066151422	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.468433781384	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.333666067694	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.

0.0	0.675760738762	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.540627918321	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.735668223203	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.526398594049	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.

0.0	0.519799484236	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.501317018198	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.528040792618	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.330931589983	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.0	Bipartisan issue.
1.0	0.938489852199	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.473462506673	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.590028920237	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.608406854045	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.49571817667	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.323014095874	Think about it.
0.0	0.188942610811	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.46472068631	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.272055033881	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.389050495473	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.398857777652	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.401904223957	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.620320465836	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.545354406556	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.267144093863	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.201642465742	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.464069901308	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.394461239507	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.397644298255	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.403730721603	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.527691238794	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.327616046882	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.260701115472	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.

0.0	0.673346372299	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.257602388477	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.715567828153	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
1.0	0.26089839091	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.734568083147	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.671765015108	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.477123750406	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.406017921953	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.

0.0	0.403682526677	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.471251235843	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.800708355924	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.871874428236	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.746461462855	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.378414769333	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.456224879747	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.531909368327	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.536387194113	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.662703240308	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.614294467489	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.806322917701	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.385173522927	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.595859432658	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.614641688599	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.338069459806	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.453121415641	You know why three?
0.0	0.388404171859	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.333582006118	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.787053813366	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.367642461061	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.627022002987	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.398347603214	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.321428646071	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.230863628511	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.734272769681	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.199097299716	It's true.
0.0	0.269582639244	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.404184388138	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.0660625400779	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.464207953372	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.26154450384	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.199607778088	That's what he is.
1.0	0.602971876671	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.289574817892	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.131847887776	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.800075197814	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.679301403078	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.3224655028	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.553936139499	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.716062480426	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.682707207129	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.462674122541	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.54044767469	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.466500130223	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.251573027587	What should we do?
0.0	0.272645494383	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.536856214185	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.660165885167	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.526554125564	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.583024147064	And, we said no.
1.0	0.804486535639	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.249243191021	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.605936529824	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.

0.0	0.565366008304	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.791772265156	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.579743674501	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.798993065074	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.459608327445	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.123924961356	But I would add this.
0.0	0.125695506194	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.1972591118	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.614463674209	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.135726334762	Not the change we need at a time we need it.

0.0	0.533313187286	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.605137631525	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.609105753142	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.475459714709	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.273512589585	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.519238837992	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.0646891708231	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.603353140071	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.

0.0	0.205520442931	It's not only a problem here.

0.0	0.207508714239	I would change them.

0.0	0.450005581147	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.514170662076	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.

0.0	0.644273272839	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.

0.0	0.0	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.789660057382	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.

1.0	0.415934702182	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.403891692912	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.7971219341	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.525892103717	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.

1.0	0.669587514636	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.869712171116	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.

0.0	0.407400554628	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.665684659701	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.

0.0	0.552370414615	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.260102915087	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.797526800145	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.

0.0	0.328725672129	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.255837839861	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.320846878106	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.797576818219	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
1.0	0.328347105707	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.329305802094	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.266737552217	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.341036551208	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.46369026058	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.202604683947	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.668829853563	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.549380949955	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.609806028863	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.130006301659	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.413439146949	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.470701303428	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.45963649983	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.413008871557	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.263263185798	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.523687403177	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.466726720905	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.651296567397	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
1.0	0.606427668499	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.670056425381	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.62455571605	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.262381470951	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.791376779859	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.544466622475	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.612826179149	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.190411251261	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.215684395013	And God bless America.
0.0	0.468798164528	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.530026013128	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.067287978397	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.586525706932	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.613862250696	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.122806279746	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.407247634535	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.599834019778	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.808242324077	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.188201990353	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.800250677024	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.25645471586	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.673381367109	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.865789391861	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.248724630828	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.516684915063	And we are not England.
0.0	0.453914509292	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.781223768494	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.468792407444	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.529955653126	But I was born here.
1.0	0.270497998458	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.260607174086	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.1993449626	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.4047347874	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.473040249255	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
1.0	0.660061222974	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.468073408428	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.466620660703	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.420480400855	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.537263424737	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.230117335152	And you know what?
0.0	0.351467021058	He has never defended...
0.0	0.47227614345	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.461544194993	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.537978461962	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.329805416422	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.742158891896	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.732488191134	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.533150413828	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.67729504386	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.648324406787	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.530865662945	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.337379893446	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.388725262483	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.861340174007	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.815186698256	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.180238533866	I think you're --
0.0	0.388896396535	So I'm doing great.
1.0	0.598453038784	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.456994875117	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.666858375708	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.3830358814	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.929759089218	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.810209654892	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.593636861946	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.473640118533	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.593964194438	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.871960527367	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.325844894547	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.270820344548	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.328473424343	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.72907365924	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.462010494062	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.465842616886	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.600011157681	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.328933705593	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.665352958496	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.420999600048	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.474011464798	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.332392837014	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.466941381115	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.446015780553	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.616007611288	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.310222660369	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.582341655365	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.642202510538	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.473023602619	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.805621783117	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.0	slot.
0.0	0.608133881014	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.0623678224584	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.604712135322	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.517240551857	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.410022338306	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.406538197947	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.476671072605	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.317031701047	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.672909635934	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.366968462369	In addition to that...
0.0	0.485086570882	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.530687997774	I never said that.
0.0	0.297458419339	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.480275152338	You know, I won two record elections.
1.0	0.589327512083	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.309995053375	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.395524468457	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.265931262725	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.484129341663	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.39908636945	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.484983833928	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.53937308157	She voted for it.
0.0	0.335263947359	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.327369262427	Here is where we are with public education.
1.0	0.596051025292	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.179673171067	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.671718581797	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.19639664601	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.531861739456	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.396098693645	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.483723350781	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.277539735305	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.196316660116	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.404779009754	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.132653664537	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.533316744619	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.53555317503	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.663189832839	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.457148867688	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.729989477713	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.742652637238	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.595992301905	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.666166809536	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.67189963602	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.53305621189	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.591844897539	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.528584917399	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.611898172816	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.531718058354	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.661509611289	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.323095207448	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.727726864512	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.0	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.280791346749	We were wrong.
0.0	0.802215310841	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.327851266433	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.305843179569	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.383182299409	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.274937984963	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
1.0	0.684971727912	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.544956739412	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.465785771556	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.470421715541	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.738101884545	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.864355113996	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.192851154303	And guess what?
0.0	0.53266612209	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.260622128989	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.603471317044	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.310692078581	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.138953354573	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.328857861588	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.275607426359	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.610218831262	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.529209957797	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
1.0	0.733484980265	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.800363488878	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.528121374893	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.606322089857	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.677759611413	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.0775479410739	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.608506446293	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.18975731314	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.338506337894	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.402165955228	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.401056807923	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.398558709652	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.542179954121	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.

0.0	0.254146740693	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.730597237238	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.4823909214	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.589184417211	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.

0.0	0.25730342748	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.264094382902	He's wrong.
0.0	0.601834163378	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.

0.0	0.607582226056	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.269611911695	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.32907184263	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.0	Okay.
0.0	0.127199875323	I can do that.
0.0	0.681580956832	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.127929897678	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.592689335922	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.584763636811	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.805223234552	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.

0.0	0.261822538867	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.248917001849	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.727853469017	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.455832545406	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.246976885316	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.497405553112	Well, a couple of things.
1.0	0.801063162752	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.606066310092	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.482006182092	Just for the record.
0.0	0.257212353763	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.555567869953	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.52680390304	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.13208676983	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.607270558833	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.255189668861	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.264901335581	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.465198557351	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.531218820654	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.865034288224	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.470209728457	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.321726626056	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.397652368789	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.386032108233	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.618187013361	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.337974143843	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.328975748923	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.277678319703	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.200635343462	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.326985209474	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.384379515269	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.192819354685	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.510209306931	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.347656751794	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.35587144323	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.462677764813	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.734962239779	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.261777404543	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.41574798451	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.530591246674	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
1.0	0.463602941438	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.518492161648	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.548984801603	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.532254118653	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.469524282298	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.600826925918	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.256133947082	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.344248402673	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.397031106902	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.524479987899	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.276996273287	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.328802779377	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.443210265065	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.254624563323	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.464768190546	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.519804362198	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.465368265872	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.395127513194	My point is this.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.523548603068	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.457214627445	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.329009058455	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.525314129693	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.321314366027	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.322810918952	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.0655604422908	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.535839499973	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.392019238759	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.2634732845	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.658649858261	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.649496803951	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.532463341511	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.621122290453	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.327232432912	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
1.0	0.48285462112	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.451294589702	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.676633421843	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.137201934094	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.875152124461	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.734236089525	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
1.0	0.731069665618	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.659837941692	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.731264130225	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.741519868735	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.872664953585	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.659133681665	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.267951728005	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.146554855829	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.607906292308	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.675912808685	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.61306294472	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.0	About Medicare?
0.0	0.725146512232	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.659490946739	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.476358614908	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.336414617847	Think about that.
0.0	0.725592215257	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.742514635635	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.603828432616	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.616117788238	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
1.0	0.603304113896	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.398755256923	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.735133418263	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.199539344817	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.324026083704	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.0665930563292	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.545392156056	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.434785924218	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.393518848272	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.261281965673	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.270971794333	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
1.0	0.599390235492	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.672272008717	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.321778952949	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.693068532011	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.600988990315	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.733851934795	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.412420808324	They were wrong.
0.0	0.387556802383	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.132392464263	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.469255329709	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.134790647012	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.18784318818	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.605197016579	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.252412054827	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.346937474012	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.537672339299	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.397622300872	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.672747408781	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.41187829922	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.0654277174711	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.310361333732	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.595225373599	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.522457757143	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.334056269886	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.400826339709	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.858428590185	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.330376689957	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.65147079432	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.407123021379	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
