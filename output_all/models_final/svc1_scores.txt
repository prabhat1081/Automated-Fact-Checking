0.0	0.407022728047	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.21959078307	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.31134180095	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.523797878946	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.524114202454	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.344125596773	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.21887341762	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.519330358691	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.298364664251	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.258023126225	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.289660763151	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.404455525974	That's right.
0.0	0.575052020108	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.38109223989	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.246596908002	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.361816702579	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.509971175804	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.417945172737	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.401487639091	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.401597420679	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.5	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.258735069484	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.408666926706	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
1.0	0.628052610341	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.166349516698	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.593354975697	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.520003588311	They're a scam.
0.0	0.395581185729	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.610874820166	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.61943929867	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.363245008228	You know that.
0.0	0.213984515483	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.398140983368	Good at email.
0.0	0.254741703886	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.832465439236	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.44704353171	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.539681637573	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.401375223134	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.4407339755	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.246412323009	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.327527440052	Here's the thing.
1.0	0.397955398972	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.828023680318	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
1.0	0.208807471783	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.243517804905	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.440707598516	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.397421036039	I never said that.
0.0	0.5	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.566338292737	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.392708418422	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.336508351677	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.510924048275	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.271649963557	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.483806886448	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.166655295234	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.261984359077	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.377496263021	No, you did.
0.0	0.225925868737	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.252050287434	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.340948607682	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.279482792758	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.474867864186	I said no.
0.0	0.451622464289	You target the bad guys.
1.0	0.57860848013	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.283464339735	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.354661214464	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.299061594556	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.630278245105	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.710849367523	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.516403434448	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.354811955385	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.380699407	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.447888735235	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.890391296207	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.137620498212	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.556961466506	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.464356974843	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.471621393166	I'm tested.
0.0	0.25506478492	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.435160992859	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.447777642491	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.42811998296	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.2126907039	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.144203350708	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.270437333832	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.374462168783	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.47926549119	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.529260408481	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.365143448471	I love this country.
0.0	0.312158232521	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.51628891985	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.287939234655	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.506832912158	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.311759279315	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.793589464144	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.673587516728	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.27128485447	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.37809467876	Right.
0.0	0.345220633234	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.295769573675	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.692246095443	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.507461510135	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.446100777713	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.535026538425	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.291128802847	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.311754018611	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.245835555983	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.0739157636461	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.307606775088	Wait for what?
0.0	0.449740486252	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.194900072287	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.526032919477	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.423336151219	It was.
0.0	0.331745602289	You know why?
0.0	0.854387172074	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.282202227651	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.450913191914	We are lowering taxes on small business.
1.0	0.979380335537	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.56804820259	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.435566213382	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.35738019768	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.490970587288	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.341563917361	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.393492654979	That is not right.
0.0	0.514268159843	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.164256179998	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.303582349198	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.431299756929	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.554740055373	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.716721062625	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.640065013538	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.318963567435	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.268987729048	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.213219046741	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.382161260262	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.549557535672	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.450425105766	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.309181813316	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.312581131143	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.302801172434	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.525858537915	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.293683143049	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.667357592305	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.310479921974	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.371092222661	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.336652754761	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.506090017038	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.330745899188	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.537311254742	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.417583672529	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.524441392537	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.385724373372	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.716542688986	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
1.0	0.635203831403	It looked like very few women.
1.0	0.6569489553	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.451195554795	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.379948848575	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.426213417638	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.590737097968	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.362099605954	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.259890563712	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.4658644326	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.345130594607	We need sound money.
0.0	0.28183764982	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.47549820175	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.546438422043	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.316146333375	So you might not.
0.0	0.348127356653	She said the truth.
0.0	0.587400539736	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.658205377788	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.582600891312	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.450278546588	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.429568996595	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.407381221904	You get together.
0.0	0.196481357194	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
1.0	0.480198300615	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.374067517893	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.202016072347	The number of women --
0.0	0.397092338587	You know, that's so simple.
1.0	0.538478332499	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.661857918645	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.469154153788	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.377303755493	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.47231476148	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.156383193146	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.52438466583	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.307740132025	I promise.
0.0	0.720539445815	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.393983259801	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
1.0	0.679447322112	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.283150574042	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.322932685479	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.346056564757	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.345588846427	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.662421423745	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.50885618841	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.42119406125	It goes away.
0.0	0.804671098798	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.800782887606	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.336800395232	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.

0.0	0.363775817979	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.359885994836	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.279738465373	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.684059023596	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
1.0	0.52405925742	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.271749542662	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.608637216592	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.231636483139	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.398344085404	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.187592764174	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.474465623861	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.12739288247	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.385888195777	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.210567345199	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.429636406624	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.255057388049	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.545227879345	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.346207151098	No.
0.0	0.401961854753	They cause dishonesty.

0.0	0.488733737492	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.56275789557	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.648057001652	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.550715697209	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.465124647841	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.165615800885	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.323407948714	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.44951031089	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.426987152789	We can't do it.
0.0	0.344049796696	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.680907984871	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.561348114317	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.583727593316	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.172998960999	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.416111474578	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.321245480306	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.238741879543	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.396244719798	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.290134740476	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.48791494409	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.405127008375	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.487908459408	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.223857669348	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.593515046325	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.569911433512	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.358627133388	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.475989007906	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.092760218049	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.454650417802	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.348194623587	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.336075136037	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.470930325105	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.590791717088	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.306115314775	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.451152039599	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.274452958413	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.558832678655	You do legislation.
0.0	0.486960168342	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.366787493955	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.550076548125	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.304112181194	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.345189692964	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
1.0	0.516837238755	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.

0.0	0.364567572733	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.548645153545	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.198162803332	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.714967092899	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.422046463117	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.746990344696	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.363755988594	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.280907785236	You just want to...
0.0	0.221792724412	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.246738949233	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.518104092988	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.0724791739333	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.724925813664	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.462301062202	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.

0.0	0.0644861221598	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.315814404648	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.71165074202	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.458599071169	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.

0.0	0.619409060831	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.195451588674	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.608259159227	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.250154344991	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.

0.0	0.691468616498	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.683326154725	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.

0.0	0.209561777417	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.579700308976	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.447285221774	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.432629070684	My background is different.
0.0	0.73385345614	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.322948434948	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.17754209148	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.

0.0	0.30911889962	I can do that.
0.0	0.344933412059	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.351280564374	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.721110435597	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.486646002023	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.415624678921	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.494092654304	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.7157827258	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.210532653625	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.339800108627	That's good.
0.0	0.418238549815	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.432258387652	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.469810634189	They're protectionist.
1.0	0.645807269094	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.471754913853	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.38300183594	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.373256870344	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.515782375861	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.31525017487	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.312799721811	My point is this.
0.0	0.57779614342	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.478647904103	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.335961840539	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.621923415764	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.271610141158	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.252454230219	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.411330165459	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.36834795764	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.450607211574	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.215497170329	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.590930651516	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.449419919056	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.305650399653	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.198578503369	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.322643713739	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.235266281374	But...
0.0	0.4564402057	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.258636302034	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.368713527947	You do.
0.0	0.674419105631	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.43759412384	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.5	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.350068052886	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.365707391567	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.307667703347	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.213649208424	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.382876209968	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.385567356889	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.149931737324	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.332700078014	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.472873679264	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.307303208555	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.228784242831	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.443926204107	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.521509499565	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.586700699206	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.704470263336	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.544294478364	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.217760026985	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.391481128674	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.188093573655	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.512099337594	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.407963147804	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.543423686233	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.406596609844	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.32977140811	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.334943498739	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.581008677538	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.517177555939	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.415716054232	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.492042400903	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.715421228043	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.608031343628	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.231201436146	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.591962095667	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.575303007429	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.397421036039	I never said that.
0.0	0.739327630425	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.474550034897	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.182101906448	We need to know who our neighbors are.

0.0	0.682778005711	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.397002209022	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.584395626793	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.389561118222	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.5	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.412291535307	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.486946563377	You've got to give people hope.
1.0	0.657187155576	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.362008675551	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.667708810234	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.216371942209	It's true.
0.0	0.478387666956	We both have a lot of small donors.
1.0	0.592026799703	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.440751819037	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.533455924557	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.332821016306	Illegal.
0.0	0.249440038167	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.378933971789	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.342720137983	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.292656409155	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.330541401144	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.34207350175	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.274170813548	What should we do?
0.0	0.342091856789	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.182994516253	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.319143256641	...Thank you.
0.0	0.195224231332	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.644806098246	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.424498859325	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.140482364673	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.293559427821	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.521457271134	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.410156854669	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.456585023127	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.116856005133	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.300314424518	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.461230163351	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.194830390305	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.593729713304	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.21146619112	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.467846710199	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.563244321601	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.42522994277	I know every one.
0.0	0.390050469303	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.318125717304	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.222757136715	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.413696381973	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.294178162921	...John...
0.0	0.593196108718	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.443425244829	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.65466909512	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.663471486097	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.395897662459	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.236431051844	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.223749857435	This country is changing.
0.0	0.594233042721	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.472679821708	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
1.0	0.456450469349	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.337249234481	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.432860404739	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.416528754829	That is important.
0.0	0.13878951036	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.195749673351	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.660353524074	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.

0.0	0.305650399653	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.814647985281	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.357845344535	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.236656227537	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.360922281348	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.489541045889	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.535983486607	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.243105026051	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.604841352073	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.416504550992	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.303270094396	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.375481464025	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.0599898228585	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.407687990834	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.388059199841	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.330726669491	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.291284013526	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.37959017571	Creativity.
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.176608730716	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.225436744442	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
1.0	0.875575837638	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.675950178339	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.330513927625	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.694978412582	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.38367029971	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.139781433121	...No, sir...
0.0	0.203392432751	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.115134610006	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.369522277773	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.329704520272	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.213806452071	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.400909263113	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.634071748658	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.173120523996	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.377576356787	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.426357722538	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.255282198691	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.25738936984	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.572058274649	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.817724575003	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.26534541941	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.558094731318	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.300962844599	No, no.
0.0	0.395260392821	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.507240790303	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.453828687172	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.345799166737	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.357115122365	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.369181579653	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.527702946376	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.464586205492	And you know what?
0.0	0.781762795489	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.478972096151	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.673248476904	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.260451244465	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.376644287902	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.385501236492	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.234886189971	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.290788825762	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.275702172823	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.454818853775	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.395947405665	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.286586964247	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.477235806147	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.475826181833	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.0376431416774	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.421110184795	slot.
0.0	0.465386208454	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.25422981089	...
0.0	0.493052165814	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.130032737158	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.296565993403	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.241598974989	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.254212058438	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.473777051252	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.559477122807	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.5	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.238257647175	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.351257532705	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.38768864015	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.207604130564	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.479662738085	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.42920361755	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.288381531558	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.591172005145	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.307071415048	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.242594442214	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.345139110622	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.476387225244	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.408485728475	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.361395082336	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.134238309366	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.54192240681	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.37809467876	Right.
0.0	0.338006059428	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.420101932378	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.189282233031	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.259705869856	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.16446660282	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
1.0	0.302150395429	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.656443062289	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.40654354844	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.264147820939	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.4620406319	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.28494525655	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.803294653995	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.283988359964	John, I'd like to address this?
1.0	0.155547226287	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.5	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.735082752079	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.634263061172	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.322906771881	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.148181206653	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.142967593778	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.284190727838	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.702045625021	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.31130565336	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
1.0	0.0825301243498	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.202457885973	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.337665407832	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.

1.0	0.224136041978	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.543709431141	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.297197103733	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.16831811897	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.446771860274	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.375484958842	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.122767264211	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.435772050555	(inaudible).
0.0	0.638773364695	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.565688299688	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.263001588304	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.726202383744	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.634275891339	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.161866646983	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.238162034353	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.0521032438766	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.10362671536	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.52079592622	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.440766066141	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.347658234431	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.678431140639	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.5	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.17522769937	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.546144987048	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.322044805818	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.517448460258	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.572038816217	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.291830572478	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.222265626515	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.235266281374	And...
0.0	0.561776766862	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.59514957334	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.526808013145	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.298473788671	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.52452076663	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.328651632153	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.27132994298	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.578372036809	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.180910464885	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.293982655275	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.898576047452	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.234762233852	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.333608625362	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.478104682574	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.478265315781	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.294321783474	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.361846233683	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.183067982592	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.642246047959	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.577477702884	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.195201675394	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.216079397436	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.533399689032	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.358962097464	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.476364726412	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.61664483611	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.28378537	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.315725890126	That is...
0.0	0.22756451534	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.183138140312	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.31921492493	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.451303137935	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.236855400924	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.448641487189	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.698917484778	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.396418372431	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.357834923005	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.262208094812	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.183259592107	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.226656558611	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.28780534794	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.51137919635	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.401597028336	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.236652677135	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.282188799422	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.236740053851	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.392079599188	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.303434742785	Big difference.
0.0	0.18278635382	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.101855842124	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.5	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
1.0	0.437944031031	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.288047034781	OK?
0.0	0.460149052036	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.241046959243	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.572001453239	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.163395540639	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.218131874109	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.359442506573	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.315224817085	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.469751555899	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.700786843617	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.286101215085	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.225262759557	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.106116302636	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.551794906902	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.208208325156	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.334710175852	...before I go.
0.0	0.370917067902	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.508141659359	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.273355272223	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.468090166942	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.421061391926	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.350657756248	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.448428609964	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.318797132234	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.559146856172	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.248506695075	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.5	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.768053891841	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.219675859074	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.168404029078	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.247834158318	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.29788320006	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.516705899276	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.5	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.355968759128	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.37288384107	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.557384248607	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.262814025003	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.23541541986	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.245815473442	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.456561872897	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.397434306556	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.676569915947	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.450731463019	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.825686015885	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.460112821753	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.425549529706	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.543369638074	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.566486614438	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.351115701683	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.245554244669	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.423323982002	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.225799192806	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.37566863705	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.5	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.442131292228	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.546466530601	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.256176326779	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.509895829452	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.244703928766	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.192363832332	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.225464432724	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.334883566933	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.475984611248	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.506306708951	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.346266850508	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.303821110156	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.404355022097	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.37504890844	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.755338610615	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.753940769583	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.227993084674	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.37809467876	Right.
0.0	0.579439970726	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.414053582817	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.273502424186	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.760564019067	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.512748316486	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.409940840503	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.482649535042	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.555000746306	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
1.0	0.547089526211	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.363284049726	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
1.0	0.783993674954	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.530567256497	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.336306543028	How about this?
0.0	0.476085941574	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.641868932866	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.604256607075	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.436393027736	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.416116232847	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.450343972057	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.356706674839	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.382415261851	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.235138665834	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.171404978142	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.262549650919	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.391010082953	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.405578760589	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.201529191464	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.23752691781	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.273962824312	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.376044632149	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
1.0	0.385975477668	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.414049984585	You know why three?
0.0	0.245456734797	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.402705794928	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.48996701281	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.198434920208	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.2882425552	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.561456748217	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.221854088887	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.48213085619	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.221353103546	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.547407991214	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.386544249791	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.256297702314	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.309899119574	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.239203370991	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.315450096671	You can have him.
0.0	0.598703504434	She voted for it.
0.0	0.43555921231	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.508958127864	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.164754984425	In all due respect...
0.0	0.245028919493	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.593126608599	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.390052735939	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.0838502814461	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.287709526379	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.760989221887	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.899742413443	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.40956691705	I win.
0.0	0.448758370768	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.541716183402	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.479328040804	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.176970242636	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.440120304442	You really can't.
0.0	0.310839009007	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.480377031664	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.124067338494	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
1.0	0.83790615233	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.244118359267	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.466938158114	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.484994583429	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.438713845046	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.412072889001	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.288435886697	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.309749011497	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.435551730323	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.59738748264	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.417634034118	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.958557677194	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.318780043363	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.403195718052	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.455337387974	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.404880731713	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.393492654979	That's not right.
0.0	0.229724516662	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.283623357388	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.464586205492	And you know what?
0.0	0.600516281072	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.368713527947	We do.
0.0	0.343072099509	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.339722141362	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.521787121433	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.327527440052	Here's the thing.
1.0	0.818273188083	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.546427152437	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.61052770918	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.380174271903	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.530333636628	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.428342690667	I've done it.
0.0	0.448391428069	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.319757984517	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.277955855828	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.66034423349	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.521309835576	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.42896407742	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.615822524138	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.435373428182	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.473451729806	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.301116756634	But I would add this.
0.0	0.666582808995	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.202521153927	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.722627181258	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.185074945921	No, it's true.
0.0	0.457794596847	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.446816309565	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.403410690082	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.28345974499	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.136987432669	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.470921725057	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.655907864833	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.474637899227	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.5362738284	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.366239062025	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.210657727204	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.507797396415	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.46185252934	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.125761161275	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.217626498526	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.248731589563	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.614440811764	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.419914847933	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.486156155922	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.580636145072	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.393974734497	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.468672710648	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.311411113602	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.406203261366	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.25571225041	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.600661602979	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.178313339413	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.367980890864	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.270456855968	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.464872918021	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.58330119944	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.517075249888	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.387484444828	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.33706374833	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.0766072179631	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.493016482764	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.374707774171	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.210142165682	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.745562532014	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.420038194987	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.389011200374	I'm looking out for the American worker.
1.0	0.673553455217	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.348433956962	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.460274933369	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.469333940553	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.564778775695	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.280057729864	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.36834592253	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.347928022915	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.417232969508	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.183125877629	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.420206365305	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.355750475404	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.153128705448	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.268718399289	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
1.0	0.71577399956	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.257312009862	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.10202071658	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.34045821289	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.530497185145	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.456113110858	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.146980497827	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.235650648636	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.645368586413	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.177800155242	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.67786856895	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.286932189507	It's a joke.
0.0	0.280267123934	I would change them.
0.0	0.446624022149	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.32842134178	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.440613763774	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.410334832715	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.456260045596	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.623347560505	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
1.0	0.572161987333	I didn't have an involvement with them.
1.0	0.600525055449	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.624259227042	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.111619601958	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.248787894591	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.354052351536	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.590035392901	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.736220119822	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.351307859989	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.513973104013	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.47070320601	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.335297016886	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.422380114258	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.361746171625	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.305002425708	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.480870559437	That's fine.
0.0	0.277963939211	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.172101258268	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.140873640964	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.340554141996	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.300510729289	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.58765987028	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.239372045007	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
1.0	0.813202080653	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.41944888942	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.144713135075	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.440755106397	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.288047034781	Yes.
0.0	0.182395805124	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.231889696594	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.235258121346	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.297550289886	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.57885172251	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.535723926588	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.331394255561	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.0366615015703	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.37934250888	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.404428272233	Not bad.
0.0	0.425087521969	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.5	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.416922812995	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.301094782409	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.189410307045	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.135972807006	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.154048161825	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.383959272054	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.37809467876	Right.
0.0	0.738904405293	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.396761223969	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.421110910527	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.554746488428	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.404417815233	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.316680082394	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.165237155405	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.433896628245	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.373211864861	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.285747109553	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.402194071381	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.233702858058	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.374429156279	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.399226826748	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.690902165571	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.137053844371	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.391185463156	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.106075723216	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.472653145788	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.391737741671	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.153873227116	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.668456642978	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.176210334508	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.305075290238	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.76915468363	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.623197717705	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.349867239835	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.535035017685	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.483414865092	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.302606959603	I like that.
0.0	0.246563101266	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.206533651057	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.259827854549	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.403059858204	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.393619266371	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.333591802889	Think about it.
0.0	0.45918848443	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.37809467876	Dynamically.
0.0	0.413631382392	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.650479259801	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.123140864558	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.122931745014	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.5	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.523987207644	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.482492218663	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.506773956939	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.4136397973	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.532366069608	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.438463883529	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.520441027315	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.406830720148	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.253008894407	He undermines it.
0.0	0.299954201385	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.376067282377	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.735939636412	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.454241268647	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.243802660162	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.23533356506	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.191605876274	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.389051457306	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.236094362107	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.819678300723	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.363915305413	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.459474140454	Both served.
0.0	0.240609198001	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.522815491647	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.5	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.5	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.440265843597	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.432758678534	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.322214673612	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.276965554687	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.266704541371	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.493769848313	You have to lead.
0.0	0.625869486732	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.412901742266	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.466502913133	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.381689678142	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.163611690337	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.240676769943	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.208681911244	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.676435419601	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.230438841486	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.331661505588	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.337650283169	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.756793661469	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.308168156731	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.289830664466	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.5197016267	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.377935429609	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.402749978965	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.219129956952	We're running.
0.0	0.916740302634	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.183458929716	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.384082589226	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.154775855261	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.485667943223	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.368713527947	I have.
0.0	0.5	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.414628453771	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.894343874309	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.273208737029	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.234847987405	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.265532923635	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.3646720207	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.264641634559	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.318616853697	Again...
0.0	0.349917956864	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.402700927224	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.389520039663	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.428976678114	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.415766002565	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.194591194283	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.343716113325	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.645407349853	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.0417770044023	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.629531651206	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.432783684415	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.753827006992	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
1.0	0.94131788679	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.724175928876	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.169714913109	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.28104159573	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.244317156168	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.220611456569	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.352076877694	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.368177771067	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.574051448884	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.461681676494	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.25422981089	...
0.0	0.142152797497	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.262771246033	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.529265809143	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.652292619814	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.5	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.434070732972	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.390819830271	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.419975685945	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.349281832168	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.397923581639	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.19986230107	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.355601126546	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.208343046572	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.413669626057	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.425381557629	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.195830582384	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.299369511541	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.4107224361	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.138581098848	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.322749615853	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.151584477073	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.221250891269	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.77599461778	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.442886531505	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.432974974113	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.285054656747	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.525142900508	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.422087751658	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.404464747618	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.441918122371	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.253884423159	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.363070322135	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.575633336113	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.47757528967	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.359832152012	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.203634907826	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.288047034781	OK.
0.0	0.177728477852	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.204771163118	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.520437074729	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.134229905698	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.520443342415	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.73818289323	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.586798711473	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.276182055947	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.691478023735	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.620443089814	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.378273345132	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.350661246041	They don't like that.
0.0	0.568122962181	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.323103634167	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.938540072462	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.388405842226	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.302843995887	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.16707034994	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.257921358272	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.178770700273	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.372719737096	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.625542574355	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.371004754836	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.315929231363	Divide that out.
0.0	0.14600554335	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.546004120962	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.42362890915	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.588761432158	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.149416482251	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.5	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.302560523232	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.533603364675	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.429359181659	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.263810381877	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.0886181370802	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.449303886475	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.569631919266	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.286269069484	I will not do that.
0.0	0.372009567451	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.198421139302	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.445135855423	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.470639102577	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.438505181043	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.486595568691	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.573284463179	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.596524555112	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.282610937128	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.231406304345	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.641456398493	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.474773948487	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.410181774395	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.370087349917	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.659461257308	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.477849506287	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.382921345749	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.409447757645	What have you got now?
0.0	0.448075349741	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.424455070322	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.467761952995	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.279109246993	That will change everything.
0.0	0.346207151098	No.
0.0	0.225292429524	You bet they do.
0.0	0.115134610006	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.271997821503	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.274314136936	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.429128911823	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.407267274071	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.453422611894	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.465394286564	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.367817846706	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.514527366042	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.313667886228	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.288047034781	Yeah.
0.0	0.265771477181	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.357023730818	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.567676137438	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.268670434417	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.676451904332	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.34485398548	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.862059438034	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.518557802404	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.562930228703	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.662944791576	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.203662722043	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.459388681884	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.239343540465	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.410810327701	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.657728780266	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.341205377088	Our next president...
0.0	0.414444376308	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.245707419048	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.368388307426	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.423645363134	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.65962982676	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.406062250826	White people?
0.0	0.279753928239	OK, good.
0.0	0.340641358177	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.485758398451	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.41400027459	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.465343194213	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.449961033345	We actually did it.
0.0	0.254904429514	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.65568833927	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.552155684762	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.5	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.337332938853	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.246698459631	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.407009077985	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.376673981205	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.396689691919	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.233943342178	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.454985669438	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.672853287014	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.45819672321	We had Hamas.
1.0	0.453520158382	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.435376513706	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.0933705050845	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.434054829698	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.265945071164	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.69833429763	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.200464758079	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.288858030555	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.22652427243	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.330191697046	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.715610588645	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.27708874715	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.300865400389	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.385519749709	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.3133366334	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.539957381988	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.470749407744	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.57962302699	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
1.0	0.637337124397	Very few children.
0.0	0.414596171606	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.126981565476	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.382213698759	They're off to China.
0.0	0.682401788197	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.866340464512	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.444434752062	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.5	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.387742206612	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.402754906963	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.304331203946	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.156947270794	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.357247393891	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.314284486099	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.393492654979	That's not right.
0.0	0.197291264593	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.397862540411	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.351151904081	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.288047034781	Yes.
0.0	0.727677635404	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.16678783736	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.658529704571	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.347067686723	I think he is right.
0.0	0.646009909567	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.244865230436	I think you're --
0.0	0.184748400352	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.394659806575	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.572475914083	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.734428849718	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.155421744647	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.470450955651	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.880274411209	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.740214561307	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.234426094689	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.384729410414	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.2474157188	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.424881545885	I understand.
0.0	0.398199720873	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.194608682428	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.262883549353	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.178343437276	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.28670133216	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.304034994441	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.363270370028	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.610608864822	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.348029550307	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.462749412996	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.360073939481	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.181695557817	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.436230152886	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.565799749116	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.372512865606	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.590527763374	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.403323852983	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.483298946625	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.662664940418	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.552234088974	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.705157892199	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.230722544071	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.428135939669	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.414376441029	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.0589941432108	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.178054409514	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.375975503218	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.510340596305	So you know what?
0.0	0.335104514635	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.125077364848	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.370552687072	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
1.0	0.5	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.375493171349	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.246228956968	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.534177519787	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.772623106751	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.280792590764	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.237118299611	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.28809083288	These...
0.0	0.318202084028	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.260068639641	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.317597685949	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.0816184708612	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.648277932277	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.799971953428	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.538514671682	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.5	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.262269194447	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.288837119052	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.493564244675	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.183582137634	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.454316769799	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.460091924288	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.189883208156	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.258071546011	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.659380213701	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.469249965652	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.476847634046	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.413487020122	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
1.0	0.542313006246	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.231795968354	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.387283012803	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
1.0	0.267561534677	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.354284332085	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.347054633153	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.270029628698	I don't care.
0.0	0.550472027878	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.677098702419	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.0618151396512	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.21384475332	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.562195459758	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.335185616473	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.366792369538	Say again?
0.0	0.198383598785	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.292433234027	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.275476293539	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.36890273746	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.523487494102	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.553245381825	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.198626847559	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.31449829592	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.589472702507	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.528628029962	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.306034865577	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.208254517155	I would just say that...
0.0	0.398187602037	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
1.0	0.354918248939	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.565041063592	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.575562727267	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.655776935139	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.442406828423	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
1.0	0.349840843884	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.390310865992	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.80031420558	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.457924628443	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.444248843815	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.445245295497	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.829238022595	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.166192890143	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.569051882997	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.336292127155	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.447676376313	I will show you what they do to women.
1.0	0.642906823722	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.539491261854	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.593536320725	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.65834847581	Of course not.
0.0	0.113897580404	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.507972514632	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.165529275455	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.257718647247	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.933555870985	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.445720069128	I changed that.
0.0	0.537661732299	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.293946489312	The answer is no.
0.0	0.66536861232	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.426987152789	I can't do it.
0.0	0.43146210856	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.239522815776	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.644123896016	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.857270810873	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.340331071862	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.364371812416	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.538196567591	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.203341618859	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
1.0	0.568218010398	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.591133044403	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.511768265004	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.478075826133	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.323325540595	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.383303249964	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.47535485271	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.609712833643	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.335940221666	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.700828148301	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.390858410848	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.477965895131	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.183794150175	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.450844372617	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.160202527682	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.11507845836	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.219803219724	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.147640077164	-- the governor's absolutely right.
1.0	0.532615211827	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.223543465409	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.479747589631	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.448185989633	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.291554572438	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.410834879389	It's their money.
0.0	0.468928948182	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.235438253299	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.380068442607	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.639026873555	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.38709838424	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.42986280852	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.469574480632	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.155206923163	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.563309615568	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.406807136803	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
1.0	0.34498999861	That's wrong.
0.0	0.369946221181	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.341778294658	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.171278802159	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.404095898729	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.354819606507	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.0593829455281	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.349301483533	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.5	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
1.0	0.466023070499	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
1.0	0.467913274991	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.25422981089	...
0.0	0.465755360919	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.661559149514	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.219601465467	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.735831448418	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.352088041779	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.82707210448	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.120619538513	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.288047034781	OK.
0.0	0.396975280169	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.594325917999	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.517547919342	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.392056961644	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.202853758871	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.715450117008	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.247809476519	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.201723252785	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.25710495918	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.215180851099	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.399584223607	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.390873143468	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.321948520041	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.133806053868	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.398462584291	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.441575634219	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.205860447421	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.321995787873	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.395117632871	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.328700232871	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.403490523856	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.385888281488	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.570374817968	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.451936464461	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.526949933649	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.512933121764	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.445610704219	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.345581906836	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.647269411611	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.438406952702	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.281907974319	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.489506477463	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.528683266886	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.681910178274	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.338835661922	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.294629405656	Well, sure.
0.0	0.47983373553	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.426451902033	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.438014019539	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.376679229651	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.367723009878	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.215193582872	I totally get that.
0.0	0.247702924484	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.436685768627	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.44447001441	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.371101602212	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.346032765749	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.407009077985	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.471229058375	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.383240372199	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.620610448295	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.420712617702	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.791182037124	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.25145246954	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.391442715298	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.866128904839	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.443946082009	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.332369093792	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.485121340149	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.102510455667	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.402972185946	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.675562107262	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.552704598292	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.303268446539	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.282589598427	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.568218294308	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.572650842506	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.313443317989	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.805947604423	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.375961498743	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.5	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.508298187227	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.321448386505	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.255784088638	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.420908502371	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.629850427579	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.26844238837	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.27816226576	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.552137942682	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.202987953871	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.491283133381	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.216490851771	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.191224545077	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.647112870029	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
1.0	0.371976717834	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.547371547759	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.653496402613	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.758254765947	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.218476351438	You find me...
0.0	0.372348692495	John?
0.0	0.667606645142	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.514999543487	And the fact is it was wrong.

0.0	0.622245070308	We're running surpluses.

0.0	0.684439676404	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.

0.0	0.226272474469	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.589496506828	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.572347439155	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.599680815612	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.

0.0	0.321205996867	I've laid out...
1.0	0.480877908649	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.398829854803	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.

0.0	0.469437350632	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.575688692847	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.280923702373	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.651914000973	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.289588606094	How do I know this?
0.0	0.354233900502	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.227386636356	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.187088402808	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.471398107029	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.711838357681	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."

0.0	0.411136543047	Well, I did.
0.0	0.422004239063	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.212943233353	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.51318299077	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.48879671315	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.471375589912	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.587620766398	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.212942501161	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.259394980338	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.399074393452	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.667280976244	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.292143592585	Why?
0.0	0.489894274994	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.530771086337	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.365052259261	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.462354491183	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.367071078683	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.542794605341	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.546165818584	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.275660177275	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.727730484179	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.219998231158	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.241841618561	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.231216135063	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.5	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.366463366151	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.577326180072	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.245329948494	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.226929646341	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.405676742793	That's what he is.
0.0	0.650473102269	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.428289719533	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.238696277628	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.354906614925	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.477511135627	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.574544653562	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.333893953368	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.346207151098	No.
0.0	0.384505681426	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.455097838549	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.473865772769	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.237820970804	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.374453349599	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.5	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.2761052258	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.455754256855	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.334309816493	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.565602933987	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.267588322474	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.492775937878	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.430868580521	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.5	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.0752867798597	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.466629742686	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.387355321736	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.402359311005	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.111731576088	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.787529188173	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.314673668707	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.513102444346	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.19198284381	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.506711666949	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.475785006136	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.551291713838	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.653288587343	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.320564080436	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.46148037885	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.

0.0	0.446983507785	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.304430280627	Here's my second problem.

0.0	0.461278493769	They're a scam.

0.0	0.35408874209	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.384068697082	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.

0.0	0.538869732569	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.161657012001	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.307579261982	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
1.0	0.456891033921	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.158851998499	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.3880301489	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.

0.0	0.419682101566	We have a tremendous problem.

0.0	0.532355322026	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.447411367532	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.468199950377	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.282423213459	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.

0.0	0.45217951081	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.53309012618	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.675444158736	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.

0.0	0.492564038852	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.298975738003	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.24408510007	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.513700770542	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.665317265754	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.42119406125	It never happens.
0.0	0.302374664243	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.47887325675	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.51226013658	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.728004103929	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.628322291689	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.186867330671	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.899599922791	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.283549894086	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.573668932833	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.329439212668	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
1.0	0.576468428368	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.480870559437	That's fine.
0.0	0.242044138894	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.538343410399	He hit oil.
0.0	0.568446717915	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.644541539041	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.312651192146	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.827194818258	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.475237975084	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.397421036039	I never said that.
0.0	0.191706893058	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.512295458227	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.407381221904	We haven't.
0.0	0.648640915902	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.4163123737	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.2336494783	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.370555536629	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.31841091963	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.72941092385	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.348516426568	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.568548592874	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.737667633119	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.46619559613	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.370501200216	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.684763684343	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.378666285187	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.636898681413	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.328999854378	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.193483308003	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.712535767422	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.383335159529	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.44642873338	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.5	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.0587517049052	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.39293880324	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.69952445988	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.338719893911	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.445133224844	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.627688010455	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.483063656262	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.314219142103	And what we want to do is to control this.

0.0	0.206562640207	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.641232854476	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.64796370022	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.295249363999	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.409000967485	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.407244320513	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.465101771478	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.347364998983	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.678431140639	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.293048343217	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.568520227635	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.445135855423	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.550169349486	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.351443674035	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.574678025102	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.351715157367	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.5	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.566190725102	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.540937654642	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.534464517057	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.227104125973	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.221845023807	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.311721438274	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.153271194579	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.363667210564	About Medicare?
0.0	0.533518935113	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.588698086798	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.250120964675	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.861476372751	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.0334220075351	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.339026017611	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.465313598652	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.188935054604	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.293377823295	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.666619080738	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.131331835276	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.547536802795	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.359809606761	They're Muslim.

0.0	0.512202787295	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.

0.0	0.245416626386	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.0811430472097	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.348690961322	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.267227851876	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.260703506701	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.633056668167	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.30440565677	Let me tell you how that question...

0.0	0.738312475142	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.343141763585	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.

0.0	0.221215174268	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.587596026072	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.658672018117	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
1.0	0.818679769562	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.

0.0	0.42074744549	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.

0.0	0.542356791442	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.341225638626	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.432033352259	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.389657700258	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...

0.0	0.641682950442	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.481495398626	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.875104773844	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.378703443983	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.

0.0	0.340613751152	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.180694645834	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.40622927667	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.191840657283	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.358154617331	And let me say this also.

0.0	0.204990547881	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.746081911372	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.

0.0	0.285781361947	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.596996936464	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.679822717027	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.

0.0	0.38997222486	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.142669111773	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.5	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.338107262106	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.219444285567	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.

0.0	0.572495775498	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.251773722967	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.509032742623	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.241885642814	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.509183563071	We don't win.
1.0	0.630718559433	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.551375591327	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.299661798748	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.390417138102	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.455385260804	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.20529711484	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.370243729139	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.601901611603	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.231267452388	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
1.0	0.480246289771	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.129310487578	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.23728581993	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.276018820644	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.539914939313	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.237723169755	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.436326951578	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.40348885597	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.381746665736	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.816233516726	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.638254323168	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.348267097896	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.167682998593	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.355578732848	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.288047034781	OK?
0.0	0.361370881801	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.76384560349	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.58916470778	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.457255056568	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.443382319343	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.

0.0	0.800575733057	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.615657794166	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.15325735871	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.226556937667	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.305947502681	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.537187976522	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.610437666561	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.

0.0	0.431723850354	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.43668798325	We pay federal taxes.

0.0	0.5	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.989052354835	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.161523739791	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.376247708481	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.140924954425	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.293181176334	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.535128920568	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.442588162395	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.565206985347	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.409038243358	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.152103922764	So, we have a lot of work to do.

0.0	0.621816462526	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.206339770099	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.

0.0	0.360107148734	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.529738859371	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.

0.0	0.248749978408	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.443342424103	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.163829759571	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.395629041888	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.40427167217	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.457143115671	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.183858062032	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.

0.0	0.0958111477744	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
1.0	0.312344914511	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.14111357721	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.453530192116	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.459846486134	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.268215224313	You count on it.
0.0	0.243445146044	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
1.0	0.611344430742	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.172672678003	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.448162409156	That's my bill.
0.0	0.350874628069	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.641780757373	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
1.0	0.82392019087	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.372928105172	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.280434488319	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.235439899114	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.538393492295	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.166489488899	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.579772235218	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.459139076022	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.361523346423	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.423281855166	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.533060124311	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.

0.0	0.198653688315	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.389241436401	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.351613021343	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.818824803637	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.0809488934246	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.522125056841	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.244839359504	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.343762768693	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.643095257505	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.316589920973	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.580220631209	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.930211450221	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.288047034781	Yeah.
0.0	0.346207151098	No.
0.0	0.356843319625	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.317642294887	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.118794092106	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.327640765803	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.590182782244	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.760407272977	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.381082187715	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.549347061016	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.657365167096	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.221498629297	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.544504789969	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.406795207538	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.465313598652	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.490881554455	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.579316872848	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.407381221904	You're right.
0.0	0.53137814308	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.384422518489	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.5	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.451078192143	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.318627376128	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.679533696321	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.196858758431	Came out great.
0.0	0.355813628373	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.272781419537	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.294583873613	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.467190447123	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
1.0	0.374046716973	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.169354328629	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.913011240134	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.848483402499	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.5	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.215304581559	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.3002484101	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.195791180683	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.328223762564	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.650564775444	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.453767463391	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.407154865894	I got that.
0.0	0.424164086863	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.351496520347	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.292000288869	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.675777526986	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.261211705186	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.813765387071	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.552890356392	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.657939170258	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.330725481985	See?
0.0	0.295955615914	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.372329519549	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.288047034781	OK?
0.0	0.196826253669	And here's why.
0.0	0.282170823762	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.427911932766	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.537538321395	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.0726624507067	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.362389526834	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.543280433287	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.389714294769	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.334787327927	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.430716584163	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
1.0	0.866071209525	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.641069575159	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.26377220502	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.222677132272	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.372348692495	Alright.
0.0	0.26909797011	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.554002044325	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.0778123275907	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.398691512398	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.729869083275	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.399078031947	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.110569839829	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.334047461519	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.68448372634	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
1.0	0.567854093967	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.642218373331	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.628875123762	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.345130594607	We need sound money.
0.0	0.371222695801	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.487503146882	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.333591802889	Think about it.
0.0	0.467487115413	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.350661246041	I don't like that.
0.0	0.213142378237	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.431986371917	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.782858110814	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.313121735922	Becky --
0.0	0.24773910449	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.472975647932	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.377758608288	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.178312754625	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.437771522249	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.192548956437	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
1.0	0.557607989112	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.141184336937	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.187455379539	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.410955054558	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.581274994363	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.387994591285	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.246320386216	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.476279820353	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.298333072429	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.174483488743	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.113153070358	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.346912917389	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
1.0	0.615058999369	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.263737186208	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.454848035229	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.683646868638	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.272074848097	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.437616386473	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.569690519772	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.428420145049	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.407381221904	You're right.
0.0	0.29317273954	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.437954691546	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.555259888694	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.608737553356	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.436037828743	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.457639282901	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.288047034781	Yes.
0.0	0.307380614042	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.593150727395	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.410211731796	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.302589797406	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.334824076673	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.273159099457	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.320710050014	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.445015506067	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.456812433039	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.357327235272	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.431043679013	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.710278214883	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.242265109369	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.226783337375	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.638901582587	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.5	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.433579410962	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.692532305745	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.428572188905	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.616332241654	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
1.0	0.814742091869	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.301860552547	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.245187185933	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.449602762731	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.399061350485	We have Arab allies.

0.0	0.572493914184	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.647894823914	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.

0.0	0.298720674811	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.308388717696	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.600231506652	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.544139785011	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.434729599615	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.452936142271	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.104466616879	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.466509967651	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.769661138289	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.389859222966	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.442111141345	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.289491299294	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.217003645604	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.5	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.305461614232	Why is that?
0.0	0.353753939333	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.419155516014	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.25422981089	...
0.0	0.348884941989	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.270665760366	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.523186171345	They want those planes made in China.

0.0	0.168410252757	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.686710227236	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.464586205492	And you know what?
0.0	0.265644961218	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.267503989605	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.613386876595	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.483554186341	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.258759605853	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.905415202045	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.34288988948	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.138160544971	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.180232884699	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.209941257456	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.290878867548	How great is that?
0.0	0.595436105754	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.345273950562	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.356058450458	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
1.0	0.733988838088	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.

0.0	0.344177656431	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.434463241506	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.31735354977	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.386117931629	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.356125586676	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.35546014966	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.462520561567	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.

0.0	0.343830867502	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.213394255404	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.219379766562	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.461337287187	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.700894613399	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.47423253452	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.374188402794	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.593574222418	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.451901102475	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.302912967273	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.285700334076	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.338550731013	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.506236208422	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.440890837175	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.583970541632	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.454990859734	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.482930076816	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.696487912639	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.285466396317	It's not working.
0.0	0.253931755498	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.466310279992	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.414049984585	You know why three?
0.0	0.5092719404	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.561377086691	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.339682785405	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.330210395528	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.538880613284	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.5	We need to reform Social Security.
1.0	0.464301832578	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.43087863352	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.332765296499	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.383551345304	He does great.
0.0	0.309351353597	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.5	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.574980032265	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.452851749058	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.182382182087	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.396761223969	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.374355359837	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.484523208412	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1.0	0.508767456936	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.439166659206	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.454339379412	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.508986751387	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
1.0	0.512641136383	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.398744307262	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.387888431873	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
1.0	0.82485952312	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.555707262104	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.598271821435	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.321245480306	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.235683848047	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.406037796122	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.0581385811084	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.329241386849	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.347837607436	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.350542029119	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.199074729846	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.105784620889	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.723851735391	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.468220549147	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.1935569974	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.481902919229	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.390955288329	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.9124317113	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.332435587476	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.251131888002	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.297039983664	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.150269249762	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.345738392346	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.403453538748	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.445299419039	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.372613551375	Let's talk about our campaigns.
1.0	0.365731723598	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.291729672471	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.511955315458	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.40411305383	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.738158909458	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.693008435123	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.232602202514	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.423157384925	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.4305781761	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.222491976192	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.598680633906	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.48838712627	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.40710651827	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.464505588775	She was right.
0.0	0.360786818814	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.408405017715	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.53964681928	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.561533433457	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.436924451984	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.309156720194	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.142717048215	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.467282470916	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.612189691159	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
1.0	0.320444490853	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.355168861752	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.175350165992	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.307818577396	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.30964389895	I have...
0.0	0.182465717687	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.423035673939	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.5	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.391250073885	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.437161818447	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.488745169179	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.331745602289	You know why?
0.0	0.382080566948	And we are not England.
0.0	0.318415911418	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.246780612137	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.646944928792	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.438959170326	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.365479342439	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.468590587428	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.224065622373	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.601678286032	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.317700884358	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.5067845359	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.312031792227	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.199902817215	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.170159145656	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.373222717787	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.382667930755	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.453903734148	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.789735977732	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.50653399217	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.582511839105	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.713987107648	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.730441121979	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.243070169561	And why?
0.0	0.396698917665	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.51287120746	You're simply not.
0.0	0.494979074631	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.316998984451	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.550596085264	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.299551959734	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.522361652204	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.340343772103	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.457498258018	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
1.0	0.540677182481	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.22411964468	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.181862601295	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.570493282314	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.332359298838	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.561794211267	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.373075433609	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.356463627598	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.273305686277	I will do that in Washington.
1.0	0.594172467586	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.427685531188	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.46837242254	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.450875590679	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.352957214872	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.133662514665	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.559158720308	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.258137653599	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.41379824629	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.380736984216	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.29876586521	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.551197226756	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.138451509486	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.46115806016	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.411711648573	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.625118836173	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.537632046603	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.275693987486	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.0705123263805	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.384959290339	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.619518409467	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.469484577054	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.751146118249	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.393885216401	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.253255650867	I'll say this.
0.0	0.189363384562	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.452070300697	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.629787110183	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.364391065822	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.579711352729	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.591764425927	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.559900426892	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.477287708945	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.281734543152	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.348433956962	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.330364872649	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
1.0	0.734568202172	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.270370845198	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.611956483531	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.144163787845	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.204854893613	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.5	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.630211684731	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.527669670165	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.385829651868	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.228117307429	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.530135880396	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.140261848072	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
1.0	0.346971085222	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.258850497681	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.551419501453	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.337094238085	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.389242555637	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.445302372382	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.539136924764	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.772457919381	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.446940313699	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.104918532103	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.471983896869	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.833639758673	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.269504041982	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.367044683308	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.303580742649	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.289075999757	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.220903082061	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.573028808877	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.529220307065	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.434484417083	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.196033563357	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.427736642725	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.239419418239	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.338647817349	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.548398668654	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.429346814737	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.522419909977	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.462901819217	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.429670921327	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.287270767029	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.406864048856	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.641935940697	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.364644374285	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.383005544866	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.45375008511	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.579544536785	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.447736558495	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.434855570155	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.552438967318	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.691655139292	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.457716909241	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.559902563809	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.346207151098	No.
0.0	0.416417677762	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.571889162045	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.450281223616	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.46786929824	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.394230920492	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.43292025169	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.535438912775	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.286122808297	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.47423253452	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.5	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.327565823377	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.47944073692	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.138451011322	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.53143734238	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.425101978373	See, here's the thing.
1.0	0.514306381047	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.464586205492	And you know what?
0.0	0.635501462036	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.320057127635	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.297391358311	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.388659882237	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.341778294658	Thank you.
0.0	0.250593935162	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.352765241839	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.437787535171	Now, you've got Europe.
1.0	0.531703851045	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.271500490123	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.44277531333	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.507082938759	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.494734172395	That's what I said.
0.0	0.327449729229	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.292753281249	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.6694047321	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.836549973426	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.390650024152	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.422424430587	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.11015002012	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.537162494377	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.428368542208	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.525391616558	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.185336966663	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.383760161819	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.588759090407	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.544013901798	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.385072345168	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.52340145726	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.350562289916	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.28766048974	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.269523422886	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.341336932226	I was the architect.
0.0	0.28179337011	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.119992109144	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.709521956138	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.175132743947	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.256360765362	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.394714632157	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.57752873615	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.388984476471	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.474332238986	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.429676151031	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.192042167652	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.294178162921	...Chris...
1.0	0.859774287561	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.492297671229	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.43698245481	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.285699207578	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.236108088547	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.44528596547	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.529376543789	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.349455913357	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.480366063262	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.352906127935	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.574177459967	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.143659366653	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.3682208696	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.573875707515	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.439099606663	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.389157965642	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.651232768874	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.448931989706	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.297335343252	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.550425848633	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.331747195805	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.514167178036	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.115938972606	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.125510695297	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.263785860885	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.421977838716	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.555844278718	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.243830836594	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.345321614066	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.43637015933	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.0609978861108	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.247392242912	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.740326369099	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.618431520688	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.262416424441	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.314926064425	I can.
