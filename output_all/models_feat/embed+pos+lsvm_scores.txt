0.0	0.55464251203	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.524736321109	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.471793496691	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?

0.0	0.43179384905	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.66868063221	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.220431508199	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.38556488339	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.

0.0	0.518265663176	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.315189608823	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.

0.0	0.282225710141	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.349154997313	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.446364954583	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.356203839385	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.2297008483	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.271985358128	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.258131589779	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.574781185308	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
1.0	0.452828058953	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.435958585988	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.448808427162	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.199181043491	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.307269376899	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.607236518181	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.505142004566	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.656939195787	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.308930016808	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.476260951661	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.566517535128	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.

0.0	0.219500820975	Or somebody else.

0.0	0.330834330274	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.426713966648	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.352691405492	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.636551567172	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.338234674938	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.549023820603	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.

0.0	0.282475029039	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.239200299753	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.262291635965	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.724943210347	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.43509575295	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.544107669692	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.209206279401	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.224344877726	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.508255236317	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.454063976743	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.225678747032	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.321323757704	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.468929511425	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.485710378263	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.667300232559	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.665820776181	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.204976395133	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.576651893816	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.26106546479	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
1.0	0.457349736082	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.430894763871	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.

0.0	0.422152353564	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.23245978207	OK?
0.0	0.188272774688	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.418467915049	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.

0.0	0.342704999094	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.251767260673	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.335389677446	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.226406159794	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
1.0	0.426788128879	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.485121689839	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.549733943894	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.487185316475	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.465263291817	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.336358368281	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.352354143465	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.3061591987	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
1.0	0.466390566489	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.737943405845	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.23245978207	OK.
0.0	0.244973940326	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.532152305857	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.236756020969	They were wrong.
0.0	0.585483271682	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.433119178555	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.342563261331	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.481647160354	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.349554966932	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.278162566232	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.241482981171	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.618258280009	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.341869361041	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.222702827125	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.233715232416	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.403227431112	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.459210467688	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.437072278892	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.255017724724	I didn't.
0.0	0.246747848315	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.258874335596	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.457237913788	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.406266424889	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.297723211337	I was recruited to H.P.
1.0	0.545874710031	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.23371101541	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.673741934132	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.514052008947	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.547822426809	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.363926076088	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.574120028615	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.504276429776	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.226786005088	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.447741154997	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.421642184871	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.683053226249	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.27614044161	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.326755094726	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.237769286481	Absolutely.
0.0	0.34112915499	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.271638538191	...before I go.
0.0	0.170927995606	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.630176912306	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
1.0	0.497304317992	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.538772526273	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.38148638185	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.583212749166	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.515636633292	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.620057072858	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.4351947286	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.235311670817	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.471912511075	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.439891365708	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.299271000055	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.237622141204	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.586856774863	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.457110860402	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.501226294974	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.769219714147	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.365219481972	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.349738980156	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.603714504858	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.558866431788	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.625652876795	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.717542912369	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.381362824338	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.49048057842	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.445312678879	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.248860806989	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.30913149807	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.280749756545	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.632139591528	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.55103234194	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.539933869141	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.347679980081	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.245590718265	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.552986973664	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.589180475802	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.246504496312	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.237522961615	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.523476869882	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.5289122798	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.323072199614	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.252156556618	It is.
0.0	0.248936798258	Neil...
0.0	0.278186205071	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.198242782939	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.486803408598	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.45562247282	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.404601387301	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.536471411045	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.333175538151	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.450808647522	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.266431586469	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.531717181893	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.44895302759	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.387525483237	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.362988720023	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.264331086323	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.607953132173	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.245626264399	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
1.0	0.40738879187	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.211829922053	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.448973344139	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.302004181832	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.416952305019	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.524687026465	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.380175096887	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.355859315746	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.597491631974	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.379171436927	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.438341624687	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.440465292466	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.543453500047	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.362383027206	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.45191956971	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.308070961427	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.229152816705	That is not right.
0.0	0.317158448676	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.469810039805	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.341138745066	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.293714327695	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.519146920105	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.248860806989	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.625032871323	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.244405117769	I've done it.
0.0	0.211800501551	It's a joke.
0.0	0.368881537942	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.446838935594	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.420289431708	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.472362957942	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.457801707325	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
1.0	0.568850877382	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.204541332767	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.430081927293	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.

0.0	0.406081123121	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.383957992102	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.502063396947	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.

0.0	0.31173023341	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.549361104053	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.354958558659	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.453257421008	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.365691706327	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.386788517948	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.249584281054	It's their money.

0.0	0.284265502765	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.184928976748	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.323872547558	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.304367421626	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
1.0	0.287075902426	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.440302419596	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.324813853786	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.

0.0	0.245721865807	I'm a fighter.
1.0	0.414357438901	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.311128585301	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.566816084213	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.194643456167	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.266591788883	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.213220291182	It feels different.
0.0	0.39979129637	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.495701463568	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.23769563734	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.

0.0	0.332975016366	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...

0.0	0.629781256445	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.548375560333	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.495421948413	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.29066084461	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.631347754884	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.238742843938	They're a scam.
0.0	0.418096140929	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.24093563754	...John...
0.0	0.441182027781	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.

0.0	0.435123170553	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.381699463254	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.266481616218	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.237261492034	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.568720875483	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.596863722328	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.198852631198	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.21220109597	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.351576587719	You're going away for a long, long while.

0.0	0.379859257409	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.334654191253	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.452185240046	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.546574959231	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.

0.0	0.579281015345	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.239282535611	My point is this.
0.0	0.253440773558	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.433458804552	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.26865963375	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."

0.0	0.217366890787	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.388043686161	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.651179300904	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.542926320001	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.

0.0	0.396801571831	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.369815451915	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.348671452948	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.415266525611	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.595053887835	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.233908639577	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.285747456773	No vision at all.
0.0	0.679934880574	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.285920498939	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.562787041915	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.353460962517	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.316233366913	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.396982538568	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.

0.0	0.437390769913	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.19886575595	And there should be some regulation.
1.0	0.484694727341	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.222151242309	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.374689919435	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.378456462909	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.

1.0	0.60902847109	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.250420567036	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.217287177228	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.453424094391	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.235270825102	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.307706506715	I changed that.
0.0	0.264070101147	No, John.
0.0	0.186680410235	What should we do?

0.0	0.343905170992	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.289436659146	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.218489986902	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.303774236581	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.232996251474	OK, good.
0.0	0.398903338379	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.

0.0	0.246273314112	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.285538270111	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.59380747365	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.509110561096	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.484281402335	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.373814501754	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.

0.0	0.527777845924	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.592238405219	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.202569097286	Because it wouldn't work.

0.0	0.523866460344	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.200784250087	We're going to create a border.

0.0	0.580293871827	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.418584928527	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.461820258268	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.284884233456	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.49639129133	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.174647412671	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.510045112017	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.405057966781	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.3714546996	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.216655058506	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.248920753117	White people?
0.0	0.217900530349	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.667867727333	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.306092077648	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.353986484472	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.24470846436	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.243529752122	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.481307965214	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.716940937984	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.224520809247	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.328920252729	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.263056533834	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.312818678936	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.277910321842	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
1.0	0.375232911797	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.263089877851	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.851147832559	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.762195673675	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.540606181777	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.377957530462	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.156794735018	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.244621244659	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.283286167776	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.526711705421	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.345506270896	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.674843265073	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.162729874293	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.61976393721	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.533830686209	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.563203567004	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.600990214201	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.31243623176	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.343887269653	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.450551633665	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.626598192353	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.404665848253	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.226364037089	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.209624801773	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.380865395303	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.249969817512	I agree with them.
0.0	0.639521183409	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.503595568725	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.422724562616	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.370620689819	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.510256560901	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.223018177058	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.638632885378	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
1.0	0.455175930447	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.689158473356	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.337313072172	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.60476605597	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.669485270819	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.566374767312	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.186151911787	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.187795059705	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.2243550643	That is absolutely inaccurate.
1.0	0.574582140073	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.385708585897	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.59800596251	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.477837238866	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.298980360519	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.190172819017	...Thank you.
0.0	0.227977056356	Right.
0.0	0.27104266569	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.275103061455	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.378271260299	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.276154435126	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.266488662756	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.545414339915	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.499837617053	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.309316565409	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.244222998957	Ever.
0.0	0.428944096008	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.439605488843	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.52230551987	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.223854884542	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.424529593672	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.465807729673	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.663183090673	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.600502839405	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.694999158093	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.216165237321	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.234868402385	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.55356275095	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.223217499521	That is...
0.0	0.555608395617	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.382047545504	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
1.0	0.576573569928	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.396094768765	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.283814456831	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.582370297999	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.388180357257	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.296359730954	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.281370966256	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.3542708602	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
1.0	0.583210593123	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.59807080138	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.354475423791	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.269532488135	So you know what?
0.0	0.679807649595	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.484587373577	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.236347926181	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.194223063056	Check it out.
0.0	0.35696215827	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.575561851956	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.229923561085	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.430507748446	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.516860642889	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.363909032141	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.495685136067	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.271975831624	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.406271913922	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.538386723431	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.650398303617	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.465377384429	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.681658655849	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.286658138311	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.568351539154	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.400919887332	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.272313244092	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.227977056356	Right.
0.0	0.206210055916	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.334946435666	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.396154707195	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.270176527261	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.647307480352	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.429898569263	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.434008651746	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.276491413296	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.319876551271	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.623088689651	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.597923497398	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.505135415758	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.210541675415	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.685927207366	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.585472103192	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.18824796765	You don't have to say that.
1.0	0.675743555412	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.66462852077	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.298307541414	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.680167570869	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.225033514921	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.238655737284	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.281304976445	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.332438530185	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.263348464779	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.250772058735	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.506528872044	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.230599291195	So you might not.
0.0	0.552912843163	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
1.0	0.752730704651	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.670656290589	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
1.0	0.446507484405	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.384509125378	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.282951180594	Both served.
0.0	0.252958586974	They do whatever what they do, OK.
1.0	0.758894417901	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.429179628203	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.61004161807	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.532708856982	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.288491930609	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.420864970598	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.251989106114	I do.
0.0	0.281047349284	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.190357137573	I would just say that...
0.0	0.153743472778	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.550204619393	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.336726700924	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.168573483257	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.245757229903	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.249050775761	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.418420820986	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.44747144215	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.507039233407	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.306357222047	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.236479315142	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.348042212978	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.227082144164	The answer is no.
0.0	0.249192710028	...Chris...
0.0	0.30316372271	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.528862760157	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.396803565207	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.549455486477	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.184800762411	And guess what?
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.534230261187	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.725141488271	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.674497189157	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.

0.0	0.558091509136	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.278857844763	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.316499723035	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
1.0	0.724997150973	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.229680839545	That's good.
0.0	0.525003056604	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.531854607986	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.580438318711	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.436880799843	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.481532156984	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.218037504381	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.612084651412	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
1.0	0.30409592479	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.172798374261	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.284799747865	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.481196036905	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.521748985984	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.300762943138	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.474515495826	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.274052426687	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.557036710699	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.276769351427	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.314977844645	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.256856854298	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.48308678471	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.395096081577	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.512110795031	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.220415145461	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
1.0	0.635063646943	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.25339244338	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.384325979403	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.345319109464	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.244753028198	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.429483422638	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.249896249697	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.501029809798	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.23245978207	OK?
0.0	0.309882003494	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.412410523273	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.422253888193	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.416315268507	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.468415482136	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.419870903331	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.440942680812	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.500658659822	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.605632169483	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.610331369952	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.551361544342	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.221286182644	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.401639403854	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.459916076083	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
1.0	0.745119171899	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.230172433898	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.191272120249	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.504868386779	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.374186704733	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
1.0	0.643520817954	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.295077644981	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.555433602255	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.280319879342	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.410233475789	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.390707127789	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.327716934882	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.226757659357	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.407591923821	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.56191732758	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.392928857739	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.217423105938	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.356093149578	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.245910512869	Becky --
0.0	0.465927274694	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.223361886869	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.318590474559	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.616092723745	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.257724736712	That's my bill.
0.0	0.243428427976	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.217605179555	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.454729880481	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.241549482861	You're right.
0.0	0.328887986739	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.301662401497	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.466987240632	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.361384364679	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.454336061583	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.321231801518	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.590709221376	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.29233026417	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.540025619789	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.567392778388	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.613265091317	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.522861184882	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.258094158519	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.226641121792	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.588971973729	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.546235934158	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.370216301261	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.504310877455	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.438881357413	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.471212416581	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.294581359819	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.628368120473	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.590031006262	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.624291105704	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.467452204003	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.584842756442	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.231352628356	Okay.
0.0	0.704710462642	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.41921558055	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.485147199133	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.247475135591	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.469911813187	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.240422792512	Big difference.
0.0	0.386502897255	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
1.0	0.539758730193	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.491911857137	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.237740788219	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.578959664532	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.218976814668	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.192891198443	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.273527650637	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.468751799711	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.502637728384	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.519352322602	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
1.0	0.664894937137	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.567071674449	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.415957226072	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.256215707604	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.394108931976	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.505373046689	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.250735430193	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.208207477976	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.524515840198	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.302677360538	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.464072275558	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.567735070105	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.281296937685	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.339864612993	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.595835182003	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.546511129966	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.450278583313	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.381899781812	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.197894382782	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.254158490511	We're friends.
0.0	0.498121473595	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.202004705833	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.548695200458	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.610664987842	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.498103485947	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.309497083834	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.529039312963	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.314416017092	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.521219441856	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.262907113591	I love China.
0.0	0.613850348109	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.48157623086	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.324353115612	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.297319463056	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.241764749787	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.618273222266	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.166908607044	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.532575856895	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.269051023368	You bet they do.
0.0	0.25323153749	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.392333320696	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.338421305663	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.620425590179	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.20313578916	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.219066213999	That never works.
0.0	0.214253513351	He's wrong.
0.0	0.526047205719	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.279248471971	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.540025619789	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.45692496766	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.603604839812	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.463210060356	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.343183090052	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.354005373615	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.253030641707	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.268206417359	And, we said no.
1.0	0.608388751684	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.665092463679	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.490003280379	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.237666144047	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.203445611743	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.617531942816	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.549922222504	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.229619569751	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.47661989301	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.613103969651	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.372890542964	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.204744735969	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.226289703821	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.254295240846	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.516781731771	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.354402054216	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.272905424262	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.257360322208	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.237691442613	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.216729683105	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.343475133974	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.229152816705	That's not right.
0.0	0.658121866538	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.479436687946	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.261964365944	No, no.
0.0	0.379093999491	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.49742861901	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.520748307553	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.364425843981	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.232417637771	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.460699253111	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.743554195745	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.410523775908	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.288174534706	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.349559281723	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.545369974364	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.567790332892	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.618688673023	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.519304554453	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.375354599559	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.185301852118	Divide that out.
0.0	0.259464296251	I'm tested.
0.0	0.403102299443	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.558234179542	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.199374738276	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.281748950717	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.421890373408	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.395849948749	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.26730851161	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.329254124825	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.59673454549	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.377781525547	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.373852041169	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.42454837904	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.340700880511	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.365938572877	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.368593144724	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.264499308484	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.500935492975	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.563046947851	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.572388619931	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.292791818216	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.442339700155	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.533766674105	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.297565759648	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.193806388284	I don't care.
0.0	0.298888661761	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.580693852312	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.415753196711	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.299968231273	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.292961127172	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.376359849242	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.303065574502	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.349418878213	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.477601138471	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.358042403055	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.68764451228	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.202235785148	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.23828820848	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.361397208682	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.471672318639	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.236785794819	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.638171657859	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.422131779997	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.248650606555	That's fine.
0.0	0.212891573495	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.272088139071	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.238918692001	Again...
0.0	0.523924251754	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.200815321861	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.227977056356	Right.
0.0	0.235326415393	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.34249119895	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.623780682444	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.261049664134	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.411203628573	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.511767838187	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.570539698885	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.312219677157	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.713537923309	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.204702870872	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.471230681372	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.445476711783	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.458635606903	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.450310332057	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.29724584416	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.609148190316	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.329351778599	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.252047109201	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.215219334835	That has not been...
0.0	0.306899841945	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.251989106114	We do.
0.0	0.33761297423	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.580028022077	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.51813358659	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.178428248771	I will not do that.
0.0	0.623281178766	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.326853030304	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.30278069746	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.338966045381	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.254143976578	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.219753181334	No -- no...
0.0	0.264221772409	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.426221146858	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.363104689425	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.613088436524	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.389749886229	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.43891028609	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.384853144443	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.579787268308	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.255668145965	Well, sure.
0.0	0.313930925126	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.550328244837	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.361689892141	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.543802906298	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.305217181691	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.485894398562	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.3518784496	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.296063885296	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.468620140074	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.641090389889	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.378318952652	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.26418860471	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.592385664485	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
1.0	0.572482218627	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.564107272983	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.358426918398	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.609434577781	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.354672253074	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.238590327258	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.269132973788	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.216356345488	We have to do something.
0.0	0.526690052031	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.301792447981	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.587022265746	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.337370931609	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.215716019257	It's a hard problem.
1.0	0.608432691101	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.704442295472	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.356397670051	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.519028431359	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.715112431135	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
1.0	0.334278898313	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.309983144489	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.368028771051	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.455971526417	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.696719044963	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.364585143951	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.316267752043	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.408295678025	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.380493731937	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.26299119965	...
0.0	0.584591906736	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.291674163636	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.469090588	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.319327565125	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.22386553411	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.434027041232	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.506519896033	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.461685994019	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.33515961926	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.271908816735	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.248499569032	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.216817522342	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.262368907003	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.206462044844	See?
0.0	0.157029591542	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.535816877563	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.223785863252	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.494982174053	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.270280262212	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.216182416987	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.519403569938	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.561066561074	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
1.0	0.685232660849	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
1.0	0.323656725288	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.415593384731	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.406361586515	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.427829273742	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.370953475062	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.50405640983	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.612182781914	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.387999156384	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.594354201255	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.251508674205	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.257502749554	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.549686968292	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.195329953042	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.341961023876	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.202761881249	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.403214963872	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.624377817955	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
1.0	0.428111851617	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.343987453963	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.695843735715	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.22387531898	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.278290375189	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.241386964374	We have no borders.
0.0	0.511309164534	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.230291614326	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.308811110368	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.571498414879	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.672425313414	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.451811413321	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.602971381741	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.458827451192	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.29904881242	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.193870318864	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.564312749495	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.534686104236	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.59180030533	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.626710321209	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.408622207419	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.575518987662	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.276707049376	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.253731837722	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.362577333017	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.393193570716	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.529751255147	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.719207422541	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
1.0	0.726026980076	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.403957554494	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
1.0	0.67318529635	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.208373450738	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.559128166572	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.512090664037	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.385390642195	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.266167371346	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.198173663678	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.243282799435	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.214693129966	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.403946972106	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.378292009063	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.276346113475	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.244519760583	How about this?
0.0	0.436201722143	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.22304211889	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.227964024303	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.301859470557	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.270543221172	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.288906252401	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.280043555124	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.481965189328	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.331743405962	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.234856865054	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.596029908165	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.40440195249	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.374460518659	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.636779476296	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.244803270783	I love this country.
0.0	0.194223063056	Check it out.
0.0	0.486674161565	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.298813275994	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.488556059899	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.371339233483	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.217362579146	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.356622717207	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.53578951523	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.486875676253	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.234628007886	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.362567519188	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.316454659487	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.419494621224	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.398546828124	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.406232943914	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.27930036166	...income tax...
0.0	0.691708534593	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.437828974848	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.530738452128	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.238433763141	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.186079287179	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.211304754576	Think about it.
0.0	0.280299253696	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.564272077623	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.413485647414	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
1.0	0.249366805358	They stole it.
0.0	0.528958340499	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.385438186456	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.238139724502	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.545871939868	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.340780682897	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.498840730777	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.273006616554	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.234084286839	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.248154036957	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.610264167832	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.329394092273	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.331987982812	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.203581571815	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.625956868801	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.41853442753	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.366195072754	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.345905714545	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.776501502763	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.3873381124	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.278382828047	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.250377345295	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.233171144629	Illegal.
0.0	0.323730220122	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.245405556049	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.558154684094	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.396968064159	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.171935366685	How do I know this?
0.0	0.587569372169	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.283157837914	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.447206782069	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.279498714273	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.575563238979	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.216504166599	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.434227830614	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
1.0	0.666824129536	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.224222152264	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.40118974318	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.176115313151	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.539928720121	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.287568302217	I never said that.
0.0	0.361956197611	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.285310157068	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.332848454859	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.266451828042	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.611309327522	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.161100728108	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.646440168937	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
1.0	0.560381414252	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.55069459292	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.311818868672	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.283524325419	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.376944577785	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.31412142994	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.276322419316	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.332908502928	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.39426743803	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.278882249136	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.693288003405	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.187663126506	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.533605981748	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.361287829096	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.230194588896	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.49516596905	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
1.0	0.680593774787	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.605917495982	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.300271353593	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.508441845589	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
1.0	0.50297989312	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.433926940463	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.307214298506	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.338367618202	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.235100368687	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.474985805404	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.264464439618	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.267785513938	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.555183785019	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.208003144924	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.18240030437	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.20835645123	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.249912478905	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.209176079227	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.229643773281	It goes away.
0.0	0.189036958851	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.278480174772	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.520181923884	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.307382223201	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.60245465682	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.20591648416	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.286297372036	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.524095396951	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.497333206538	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.364811793494	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.578478963814	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.273250882984	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.483079662596	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.661334919787	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.471855433002	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.228580347492	You get the Congress.

0.0	0.525591219245	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.504528893994	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.496609901919	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.285528417142	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.380430260861	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.

0.0	0.274979918848	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.701971287621	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
1.0	0.587806150988	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.

0.0	0.329056308852	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.292004649129	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.233903961335	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.619550890931	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.58194287373	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.433864211209	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.36777896719	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.60890389969	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.

0.0	0.179428919661	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.5767072921	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.289960437519	It takes away discretion from judges.

0.0	0.436345723344	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.

0.0	0.356256766495	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.621836239965	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.

0.0	0.251203079833	That's for sure.
0.0	0.376296220787	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.595239092271	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.234030306603	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.398206681269	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.282654027389	I said no.

0.0	0.323380906563	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.296360300586	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.544694934242	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.493453022319	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.303194290509	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.225227357843	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.698624806784	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.440252208271	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.522151392139	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.432086007752	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.170458634085	It will be a long day.

0.0	0.263672716939	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.211421482102	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.391043742966	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.443800400559	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.56045107591	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.44566303264	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.356556599716	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.436000100134	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.555544601452	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.284699964147	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.506195496346	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.446208512801	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.220216938424	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.302346385657	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.407131608331	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.236263319503	That's what he is.
0.0	0.407316128756	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.366099406093	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.553868719824	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.448182825793	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.214039812723	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.268521543617	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.575100812949	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.46951134804	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.739466296489	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.487244391971	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.577763443869	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.338094174888	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.363174855253	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.526600777455	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.382167047689	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.303693147329	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.160880501308	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.212503525468	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.256940103169	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.328192982798	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.659194396009	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.504083660169	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.421494743267	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.220874829906	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.239999412341	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.452709056516	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.528456412498	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.280281169844	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.205464562924	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.485770234779	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.329027092352	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.501646044443	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.377568528536	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.217217777771	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.465208508089	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.294244420946	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.238455291279	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.241825078725	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.244910003692	Our next president...
0.0	0.34242800214	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.487505551602	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.510159088459	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.222491082166	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.703476580694	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.545033924028	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.479433589689	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.516356546207	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.351871149877	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.421642225357	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.344319301975	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.268531836233	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.411683003865	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.245184826142	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.258007126482	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.189153278956	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.721572386864	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.525984314178	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.483024882565	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
1.0	0.376671589301	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.493128450078	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
1.0	0.626840481883	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.471877719829	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.413368702194	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.307294928351	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.209293329805	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.382251847094	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.637472206115	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.322060923982	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.395793278278	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.532722978408	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.434169539359	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.416284729742	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.359066844971	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.255833282111	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.252707655135	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.245881416004	in particular.
0.0	0.395267159261	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.419534760825	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.222783498127	He is a good man.
0.0	0.19941179694	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.456321413258	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.30842455343	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.539482820244	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.390144719721	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.446783549206	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.280736082276	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.354062218578	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.426468147136	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.245393081491	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.18295834287	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.394656357296	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
1.0	0.248664378152	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.155995602286	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.344298194837	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.64602466484	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.439800200742	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
1.0	0.408556261484	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.234871136515	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.239591662946	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.383804396498	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.395535832602	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.320722301504	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.280631855662	It was.
0.0	0.413493418313	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
1.0	0.732731902495	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.249475166105	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.358658312472	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.348812382242	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.314323900164	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.322731193753	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.501891202822	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.521720314323	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.240164569741	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.249175553217	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.220965100145	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.303632223575	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.603413197073	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.279523489896	I like that.
0.0	0.784398681242	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.292984537765	And for good cause.
0.0	0.436063281547	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.340033689856	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.277089854675	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.267292068929	About Medicare?
0.0	0.277765087534	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.606800083553	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.624288705527	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.223641392939	I like it.
0.0	0.365929577323	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.254030583253	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.419752324353	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.244744783088	Alright.
0.0	0.634787886943	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.43937538529	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.413697309644	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.602512200873	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.177146856202	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.278199922059	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.538577852952	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.328663884304	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.403245632777	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.559135145892	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.694026384695	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.299642018313	That is our government today.
0.0	0.241621446248	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.532915755935	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.633331334949	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
1.0	0.498949197797	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.462893314733	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.279240865063	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.256060131811	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.291721870819	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.305309046541	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.379524431272	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.455455827627	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.530857859626	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.499504065092	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.24793592817	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.530890141909	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.537989270271	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.23754800408	That is important.
0.0	0.33893193982	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.388406592255	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.617875012559	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.348806229887	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.624894572534	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.25870093391	Why?
0.0	0.367876389264	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.568906329831	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.636147261498	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.295718993917	Why is that?
0.0	0.296212542521	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.198974459873	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.456949621849	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.242257147593	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.416070620138	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.263503211107	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
1.0	0.489649024344	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.199292425985	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.254375279319	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.34450687578	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.226732129526	That's the difference.
0.0	0.342037785333	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.22777354664	And you know what?
0.0	0.538528708091	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.193724836017	We don't win.
0.0	0.264781439269	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.561293154421	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.339705277889	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.317577654043	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.568982331379	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.553005466366	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.421815725852	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.659371544908	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.225836179894	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.519538830402	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.454939529283	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.420503870518	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.44793858817	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.182358340132	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.320931267196	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.211778964834	You just want to...
0.0	0.427711572175	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.277810113667	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.261428587538	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.482812434383	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.305163348355	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.487831948237	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.327902545552	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.372836048348	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.52862458448	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.325588549583	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.527362088708	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.46098342905	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.31502762173	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.304365994547	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.49350587818	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.305409923708	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.49746773001	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.525614620095	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.699097568847	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.513139874619	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.672538261474	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.216059941772	You can't do that to the party.
1.0	0.614510213451	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.255833282111	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.570415795123	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.337389919773	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.219180593689	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.232076749089	Yeah.
0.0	0.337032122308	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.259493803594	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.314280060763	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.679094681306	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.356839946306	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.332848454859	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.500352591602	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.263011680541	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.499708480447	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.537057277776	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.521711750167	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.331749233445	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
1.0	0.750371401019	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.241992202314	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.753832019788	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.256444406644	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.459173733193	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.540157586802	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.238918692001	So...
0.0	0.652709364896	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.232580906616	(inaudible).
0.0	0.538636986481	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.311414641579	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
1.0	0.334462527031	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.526999420122	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.578949684385	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.208498866711	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.332913177755	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.269281102396	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.58064102735	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.266109009315	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.604952716818	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.398403745036	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.494010733274	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.586220034189	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.

0.0	0.28967012693	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.426184200138	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.370222683456	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.349761503326	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.472114880381	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.177189870391	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.595143147454	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.471662027697	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.284522880488	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.204683748379	I want a government so small I can barely see it.

0.0	0.274068860988	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.247183434882	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.585896471935	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.283040933173	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.245949352357	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.497233854393	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.191278354834	They don't like that.

0.0	0.254299765872	John.
0.0	0.193334177343	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.211750312522	Think about that.
0.0	0.600021158633	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.576591584621	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.402221938932	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.318821271454	So we have a disagreement on this.
1.0	0.515455627837	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.244133500379	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.299670504217	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.282936629723	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.373641603767	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.501139685066	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.373981235167	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.328780133068	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.198931178237	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.221772863822	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.401344418232	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.53018059652	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.530650634417	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.489915866964	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.22777354664	And you know what?
0.0	0.360296087969	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.174396835779	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.313865280416	We got rid of Gadhafi.

0.0	0.471447898942	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.403891709542	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.244161720338	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.347312555676	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.556964175949	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.270093590917	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.362306832482	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.196910044532	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.292549617656	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.406228525886	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.467664953996	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.398817971728	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.205464562924	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.607477219432	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.34294752668	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.344374725566	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.625904341649	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.56872745409	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.16711123057	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.32214075479	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.215204991849	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.574169821158	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.389614035975	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.326132580979	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.203360647066	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.285438969975	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.568067010142	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.

0.0	0.299724298185	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.326209861941	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.456370737701	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.476955230378	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.323984084288	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.241960448583	I want security.
0.0	0.456469877813	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.

0.0	0.31811884009	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.546298023416	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.679950596545	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.224085647231	You're welcome.
0.0	0.319842808265	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.1995879809	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.614490378377	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.335497797944	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.325149637914	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.289344265436	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.25948829216	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.27679931232	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.353956976183	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.379439190624	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.659519576699	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.419481516577	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.456261542296	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.531719178568	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.62275595707	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.362974572732	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.389233550453	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.507873862279	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.243615000704	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.22785429777	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.57669725311	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.373431954296	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.475350873748	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.587334537504	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.385290364282	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.188178195068	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.237519215841	We cannot be the world's policeman.
1.0	0.729731264933	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.444976972905	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
1.0	0.573452408718	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.316491836413	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.454049722817	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.446691894224	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.623373927632	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.451578628069	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
1.0	0.219067795385	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
1.0	0.58339102208	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.35538539494	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.547937311746	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.5656093666	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.369320456607	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.582236730726	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.23198006266	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.630074349088	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.430614303578	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.475599598956	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.22641804853	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.442568711327	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.46598059621	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.357831519374	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.254299765872	John?
0.0	0.326686284379	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.350327086188	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.397027792587	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.212343708576	Wait for what?
0.0	0.375223479107	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.336176937807	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.420139575988	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.220069788187	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.192678733843	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.385660887019	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.449628899439	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.580724884129	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.307642043318	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.625754847419	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
1.0	0.401506161529	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.216402804083	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.297827611687	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.409885212666	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.249286671279	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.48379537446	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.222565077977	He does great.
0.0	0.252447407011	slot.
0.0	0.318453148273	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.233334480598	We haven't.
0.0	0.244240315578	Creativity.
0.0	0.479757553654	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.309592056707	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.584255711928	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.277431304284	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.54766696097	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.440888274244	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.602342430047	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.257007070784	My background is different.

0.0	0.226372476248	This is what's going on.

0.0	0.630079946207	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.447206782069	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.620135909423	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.

0.0	0.210977291671	That is what I could do for the country.

0.0	0.324546511955	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.688905914515	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.485012949154	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.719459996335	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.523501466821	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.391800219123	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.

0.0	0.257818108611	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.653460813894	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.685038412795	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.259802083626	And why?
0.0	0.245413735867	No their not.
0.0	0.408939873465	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.628678102071	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.310500166239	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.539552681808	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.39220292291	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.32300187185	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.438197572124	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.361879237989	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.165046473784	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.233909814187	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.230793752873	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.543501988133	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
1.0	0.537162946381	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.217807163047	That's what we need.
0.0	0.373683636634	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.601115920559	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.394673751391	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.504937615121	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.233250716105	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.209511430225	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.320772446772	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.67098816135	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.571566554751	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.328840359857	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.661879207212	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.525642081482	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.337719598657	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.259051812295	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.505614459283	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.175288297974	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.502163515956	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.543143136514	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.420908820027	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.619751084879	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.354180851321	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.509263979315	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.526509351696	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
1.0	0.641356176037	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.4708804797	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.432897026443	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
1.0	0.315275549013	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.285209113474	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.332568297967	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.389228143552	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.518214435965	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.527354834358	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
1.0	0.54500883128	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.184696135132	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.683236849672	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.269689489434	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.287568302217	I never said that.
0.0	0.382040412658	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.65779088754	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.580443875004	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.296511832	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.257190147653	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.220382056868	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.25041779717	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.268255936047	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.57318153748	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.235129543428	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
1.0	0.783553813621	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.644359888003	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.26299119965	...
0.0	0.398784289834	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.513203536359	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.340237537535	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.52261205983	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.166414431023	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.497537941596	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.212821294448	And so do I.
1.0	0.521207914595	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.732144498532	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.458582228794	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.227601882068	He has never defended...

0.0	0.221286182644	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.647658117585	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.23178934368	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.376066016185	We've already got a great talker in the White House.

0.0	0.229963808332	That's right.
0.0	0.45065166501	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.510792825522	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.218018226042	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.537702874217	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.404352085931	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.263944104792	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.

0.0	0.228639472803	But it is a general economic issue.

0.0	0.286972860089	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.379787334718	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.258977467029	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.250150333898	And here's why.
0.0	0.202546715326	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.559219842803	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.472256729736	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.224710291466	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.257413679942	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.401422109149	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.

0.0	0.312342749857	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.176310644912	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.171523136353	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.386372153799	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.352523799648	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.219296124473	...No, sir...
0.0	0.383797902314	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.213642150027	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.355841113933	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.35594788897	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.548828939342	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.329470147963	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.236247535609	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.448656832029	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.459360115704	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.64202083818	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.538493565064	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.568745039239	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.441240142117	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.313527728841	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.440495336613	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.539613152067	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.46875524291	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.346082326662	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.690410035786	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.406818420404	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.477226155097	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.229152816705	That's not right.
0.0	0.478980251506	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
1.0	0.604082444039	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.519809592214	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.43589521521	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.248941844303	They're off to China.
0.0	0.26734343608	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.5937487809	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.209239204473	But I know who the pessimist is.
1.0	0.65442901071	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.424594863814	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.412583563701	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.365288722954	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.270410750809	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.277096518633	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.472961167072	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.358761711832	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.58460259882	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.252429302465	But...
0.0	0.328630979577	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.412241478611	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.210690558979	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.450126434464	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.245253736108	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.497877911637	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.631943943416	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.614457712259	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.342523320721	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.564030393638	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.319735338817	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.304489516204	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.230706641347	That's a dictatorship.

0.0	0.5727391751	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.403921966264	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.397899791909	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.512150287486	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.435993857929	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.595053887835	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.586288060317	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.312537207188	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.73817206676	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.468365729642	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.

0.0	0.326791684775	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.27210209066	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.243278614737	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.

1.0	0.653448061994	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.

0.0	0.214180017199	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.607895642054	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.530374937653	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.491051232363	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.593860110345	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.617946283584	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.395934922842	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.

0.0	0.615841660812	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.224155057713	But look...

0.0	0.258897165974	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

0.0	0.204578143185	It's not responsible.

0.0	0.234132648873	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.4751248436	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).

0.0	0.289593133101	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.294496100119	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.270226796957	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.277728760734	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.619548642868	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.297756450535	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.

0.0	0.500749772911	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.636105943007	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.391695761787	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.555318302224	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.598109947355	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.

0.0	0.478903415642	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.22934590249	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.401051149568	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.

0.0	0.45084687813	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.540159408898	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.

0.0	0.566537684713	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.662079156627	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.

0.0	0.31058690694	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.539227913731	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.294532173284	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.22848190408	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.258470133995	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.52076834701	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.394511150465	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.570151133886	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.22777354664	But you know what?
0.0	0.296443383508	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.162036969202	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.356401904374	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.24831632829	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.500813652149	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
1.0	0.592611410056	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
1.0	0.656470646314	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.375261265957	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.383698953022	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.469157151594	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.304208470515	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.245231536549	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.588051311196	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.353297222525	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.172512122285	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.380625337977	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.357954416788	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.60330177644	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.490925261431	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.654146240734	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.241039759052	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.288595392395	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.331885640756	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.328025014054	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.293180568697	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.597555180407	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.387508806367	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.401525965382	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.488649922967	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.510159088459	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.363708958545	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.415558283763	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.25367383429	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.466948391558	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.46633702662	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.399101801344	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.602364826487	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.343135669815	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.394303244658	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.33074207042	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.474589821498	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.332693707605	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.345010519851	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.331484216731	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.211692045409	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.702943262831	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.533395253854	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.596768767662	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.208452815173	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.173834014195	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.252550881675	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.20244475467	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.498488529497	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.379643951596	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.562722332341	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.682568559154	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.226428531784	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.23245978207	OK?
0.0	0.295134046692	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.273371638555	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.225464608118	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.236084734365	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.533260648922	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.486816287235	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.260698058228	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.50537039366	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.557797747416	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.19626337681	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.496497644042	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.335765519503	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.563895387268	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.30075441552	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.573729056852	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.296984861251	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.265017525017	This country is changing.
0.0	0.464667474219	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.533360211846	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.33380462228	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.286944943419	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
1.0	0.344350838944	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.235688564674	I think he is right.
0.0	0.445807488968	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
1.0	0.661321402508	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.49945286807	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.413513776374	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.552990946509	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
1.0	0.265294657535	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.328418933085	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.6382092599	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.227623040138	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.373268208846	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.185533783006	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.368035819671	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.419121221026	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.186782480027	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.311495064877	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.39907736979	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.26297041705	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.440912287778	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.137444368764	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.157443640204	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.261456097878	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.631578670582	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.395848464194	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.297909564879	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.406400179858	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.527553442401	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.257908072369	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.355823442579	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.455366748321	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.363881628722	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.340030950884	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.544302495587	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.48449777953	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.476912734961	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.517472441084	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.466217236151	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.66358684605	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.623888124803	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.426297216604	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.439514614773	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.597729768594	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.543154445146	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.29020003471	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.412040957115	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.504281779172	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.589395154655	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.227977056356	Right.
0.0	0.219475886571	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.295254518272	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.534520768097	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.295348478751	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.207488839999	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.321765288382	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.324910646221	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.509738921712	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.528348462413	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.496608765372	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.529751255147	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.308794606343	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.240010588031	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.458891947544	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.588430542979	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.652514743055	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.375411992963	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.244021696858	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.178501508653	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.527236472551	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.505187929783	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.214253513351	He's wrong.
0.0	0.611967335559	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.494646762368	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.223396931335	It never happens.
0.0	0.238455291279	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.648224109973	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.332266730836	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.340274421298	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.214716865766	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.416297422661	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.260121038199	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.210566867879	Say again?
0.0	0.573010389771	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.438534061391	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.267065456967	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.290341943396	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.324398865746	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.675056481668	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.495484412265	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.389244614013	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.398422821617	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.235395568757	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.443334157846	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.43745740107	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.555307374469	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.730145251791	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.471478768339	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.25270489459	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.229221776667	These...
0.0	0.279260607292	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.314156438651	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.241109485534	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.538944172533	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.630169016871	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.272317396202	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.315103674776	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.265618189852	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.41922523592	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.395471453845	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.360963818691	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.378702798111	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.419504939733	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.602764722657	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.450683597397	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.536943542934	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.30929839716	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.438987901693	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.357586238613	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.256431712891	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.293858873131	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.250045604877	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.564897927301	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.604124916018	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.219132605436	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.576335169916	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.195347061552	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.238742843938	They're a scam.
0.0	0.30046135647	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.551687728115	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.568676650325	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.157137146696	But I would add this.
0.0	0.239717352178	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.189174630137	You have to lead.
0.0	0.571718732334	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.612231150519	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.269133604969	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.480316394333	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.225165298313	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.512724431576	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.254586496825	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.271915833404	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.439029815891	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.191415450007	We don't need that.
0.0	0.332132599341	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.5403098872	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.385757759452	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.432136162453	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.522220537031	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.0	I can.
0.0	0.334592757405	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.403371211148	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.45566825519	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.356828709752	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.278836906603	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.180084789771	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.579984603679	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.521657943921	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.273618476072	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.271981980191	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.405260177934	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.511637093755	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.515216556604	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.406080636662	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.703348929213	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.33831499345	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.308978197119	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.346197671371	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.230086581475	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.375739564905	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.222769221587	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.436063623908	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.29975684304	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.252429302465	And...
0.0	0.600267482011	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.272682869316	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.2415417128	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.215399064876	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.495161068976	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.367025150595	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.212203809825	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.244536522359	I understand.
0.0	0.51849182603	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.439984168055	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.251989106114	You do.
0.0	0.481954048207	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.241549482861	You're right.
0.0	0.331553431806	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.500931385109	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.250235314614	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.239816345295	You looking at me?
0.0	0.365114644801	Never been done before, never been done since.
1.0	0.553240412969	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.254143918048	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.392921172172	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.273325373307	I was the architect.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.272189529097	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.185058440924	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.493196438282	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.46232200302	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.628723863611	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.461289634895	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.251721410499	In all due respect...
0.0	0.260638951018	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.64750267063	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.18342861256	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.541220640456	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.282827457268	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.507742948575	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.471833816967	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.431169679198	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.246191780265	I win.
0.0	0.268194882364	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.204982436208	That will change everything.
0.0	0.285438969975	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.230985911671	We need sound money.
0.0	0.282972565255	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.499944398699	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.430874429068	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.552098431882	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
1.0	0.351432606763	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.57785203792	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.668642174712	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.600140175009	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.357328833057	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.52909373422	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.576933413931	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.216556320188	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.364725088612	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.355343673584	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.379797055296	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.389701830723	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.544837718893	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
1.0	0.702889324133	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.688476635014	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.461666096257	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.575587618199	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.279169212756	You know that.
0.0	0.381770741866	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.338092757234	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.243736482801	I'm ready.
0.0	0.343813438765	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.617949745686	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.186128286	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.358009053195	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.506583472054	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.680344627643	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.244182967485	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.609468996162	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.227598935532	You find me...
0.0	0.225111118116	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.679094681306	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.200184304346	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.316363269979	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.209579750625	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.549358925776	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.431553375387	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.469722733543	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.368919788877	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.217543327189	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.246552943548	I promise.
0.0	0.490574345969	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.275581458808	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.335081237253	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.328439009261	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.369161776905	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
1.0	0.682331258278	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.319010835045	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.242860654994	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.502582632334	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.522452268983	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.300593169097	And God bless America.
0.0	0.544728562664	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.522639481723	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.295781831691	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.0	I can do that.
0.0	0.430844283385	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.518283648877	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.442281083164	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.268455351151	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.24365339478	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.538500234255	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.511785127562	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.473070987008	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.288339605512	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.544136949988	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.528950112903	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.186269543549	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.567618262002	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.388504317013	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.302273714497	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.325005038479	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.233401382917	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.198777802155	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.518262516029	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.261651519402	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.264858593332	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.535246516156	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.585978133653	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.434702248297	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.496513304035	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.181054157712	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.268043799094	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.434733233277	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.476578083188	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
1.0	0.293752565527	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.296774266531	She voted for it.
0.0	0.423872620714	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.444202886663	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.394769726914	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.312795674389	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.289649366492	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.487121104483	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.264676886698	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.249676553873	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.555101625168	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.0	You know why?
0.0	0.389010331589	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.705920735556	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.524667079056	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.530516323697	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.710745401284	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.592877360958	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.395180737931	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.304278025282	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.286854454836	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.30230914646	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.616478570432	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.578230218659	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.545287889442	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.460374426543	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.477046330593	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.224710400113	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.506371741976	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.251012076263	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.405322824339	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.271594697169	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.147923469051	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.207652583523	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.557179163961	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
1.0	0.615738750487	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.278379644323	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.333404517036	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.493999611348	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.458950655839	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.264255060455	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.26496556982	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.191442163826	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.268690989406	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.341454557776	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.342293297152	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.442422036119	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.294764864503	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.236046604349	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.224875611033	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.318875462503	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.395438646534	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.216058584583	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.547125181731	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
1.0	0.414925633986	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.549557576943	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.334921554678	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.476142244864	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.214716698043	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.333329274831	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.29939668386	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.278691149953	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.19909325517	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.25579758367	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.246705104884	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.36876792342	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.445551439904	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.413798829736	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.659423788959	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.285421662479	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.184370849779	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.276311569562	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.197566864307	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.312537207188	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.228386815081	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.540805719754	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.135825602553	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
1.0	0.597674598194	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.299053337505	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.454973051319	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.372659750248	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.22175883634	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.448304891686	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.232211902689	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.527617813265	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.617759141032	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.329463941536	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.394959254735	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.586599399055	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.464830630909	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.196844831269	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.3334267461	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.681462397066	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.301734202693	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.266575194126	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.266657974864	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.300177081757	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.237769286481	Absolutely.
0.0	0.421670579597	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.612609615494	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.352618945324	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.317080630472	On welfare.
0.0	0.520732496342	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
1.0	0.688379301671	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.600882473721	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.341327337786	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.367299428649	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.422339064091	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.438304802378	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.20880958673	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.237667877892	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.317039891192	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.199075455292	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.345974322304	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.285513947764	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.210101929843	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.266618054116	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.430408050513	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.390832405234	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.206183822096	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.440266010094	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.267168613479	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.178338374926	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.250887456478	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.418364460985	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.310379628154	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.25825560928	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.446958375758	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.373592367487	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.253559468307	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.336361536891	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.590972230326	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.537302673729	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.251534717831	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.610545503218	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.180759534857	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.187770554013	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.208435337324	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.317039891192	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
1.0	0.486424375144	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.34841082217	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.636404701334	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.291743785138	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.461028105022	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.250462322604	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.667867727333	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.371567651768	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.24896850973	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.299146066727	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.641385467587	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.366029877303	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.256197742134	But I was born here.
0.0	0.313918528288	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.35173304396	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.495984602249	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.48268108521	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.533669555418	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.342521383452	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.530241189499	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.481493469489	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.194849515653	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.259549883465	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.581675252582	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.527071648868	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.244726782186	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.599759993422	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.314943927219	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.474144745114	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.176310644912	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.341098468006	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.325569639624	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.480447090644	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.379844404417	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.603239772455	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.483265661701	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.382435311278	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.656475612907	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.253129956681	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.299264108422	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.361349350051	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.242120898373	We need security.
0.0	0.661689815795	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.549960804938	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.534235706138	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.583136253001	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.290086970134	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.465415973067	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.572047365742	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.318962729225	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.417267247151	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.282358021762	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.644946474805	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.312489466981	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.651212819439	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.512377259207	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.473988268243	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.829780951462	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.42451471955	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.287568302217	I never said that.
0.0	0.40957789051	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.599431977216	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.413245614062	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.205154420755	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.455876424034	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.570350502767	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.348284765633	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.590874437146	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.41961942878	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.519275648211	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.326182820393	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.320069977563	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.643138015888	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.23245978207	OK?
0.0	0.408896960982	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.454249093506	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.331551261212	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.669777853553	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.229475956763	I think you're --
0.0	0.599807209446	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.181190242658	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.356231135927	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.632911790724	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.434167773649	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.246572607184	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.193021364579	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.45361803654	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.291828019533	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.211304754576	Think about it.
0.0	0.543143136514	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.350675225525	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.599258153619	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.453185376568	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.617366433665	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.525363488558	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.578446893911	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.467584131837	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.243218649799	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.715033170261	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.260415813879	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.282603015694	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.344302665709	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.505692855475	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
1.0	0.705335787522	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.451778999654	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.59903538808	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.657121931392	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.238590327258	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.690517242637	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.581923600504	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.383185471716	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.482544937382	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.577779254002	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.509006670475	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.374603990038	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.199588322734	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.463678167125	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.603109544141	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.217500706889	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.22777354664	And you know what?
0.0	0.230985911671	We need sound money.
0.0	0.250533333257	They know.
0.0	0.269815213124	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.539413475121	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.414879831486	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.412825082044	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.261444912335	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.573938896216	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.673247675699	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.393992613263	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.368050626442	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.225232687579	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.306419641335	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.306991156734	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.23775677262	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.509545834478	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.443927541042	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.263421009098	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.534203484949	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.221214193492	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.267887221462	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.258996679081	What have you got now?
0.0	0.565709255979	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.470506561217	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.244937332499	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.283414978488	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.518617574284	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.500070654746	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.383957992102	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.596026742492	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.561736111141	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.531938706663	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.619332629473	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.219974184408	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.569214533495	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.278156663013	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.485480535503	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.25343584581	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.443219555953	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.226279371787	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.6525131831	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.418965285605	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.493087758676	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.186483408874	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.565862825073	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.396528385709	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.341204958336	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.272313244092	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.333630037062	I was not at all.
0.0	0.460200913552	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.463518519437	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.222324266692	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.176826888387	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.191615029176	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.514921427665	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
